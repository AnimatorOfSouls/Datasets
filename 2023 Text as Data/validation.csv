If you did not own Destiny (like those who sold their copy after the disappointment of the initial game, you now have to shell out another 60 dollars for ""Destiny: The Taken King Legendary Edition"", which includes the original game, the two initial expanions, and the titular Taken King expansion. The 60 dollar price point might be considered a steal if you did not own any of the game's parts. If you want the Taken King as just another expansion, it will cost you 40 dollars; double the price as the previous expansions, with slightly more content. Without the Taken King, you are capped at Level 34; not enough to wear any Exotics and most Legendaries, and most Crucible Faction gear is now off limits until Level 40.Sporting few changes to the overall game (such as Nolan North, of Uncharted fame, as the new voice of the Ghost, new items and armor) with an added total of 4 hours of storytelling (not counting the already released expansions), 40 dollars is far too overpriced for something as meager as this.

It has some of the funnest missions I've played in any GTA game. It's obvious the game was designed with handhelds in mind. This time around in the GTA universe, you don't have to show up at a contact point at a specific in game time, meaning if there's a mission available on your radar, you won't have any down time before you decide to tackle it. A huge improvement on the whole series, even though I only expect it to stick around for the handheld games. The story isn't anything astounding. It offers plenty of plot twists, but only a few of them actually caught me off guard. The ending is also incredibly weak. It's a great thing the gameplay can make up for this. Alongside the story missions available, there are plenty of things to do in this slightly scaled down Liberty City. You can do all of the normal GTA side missions, such as taxi fares and taking down criminals in your stolen cop car, but this time around you can be a tattoo artist, sell and buy drugs with a very well implemented trade system, or opt to destroy all of the hidden cameras located on top of buildings or other structures scattered around the city.

I was shocked when I heard the announcement that VALVe was publishing this game.  After all, this game was originally a mod for Warcraft III, a really fun strategy game made by Blizzard Entertainment for the PC.  VALVe is a company well known for their first person shooters (Half-Life, Team Fortress, Counter-Strike), so I was wondering why they were even entering Blizzard's territory with this game.  My questions were soon put to rest when I played the game.  All I can say is that this game is simply amazing.  To start, the gameplay is a mixture between Real-Time Strategy and role-playing games.  In this game however, you are not controlling your factions, you are only controlling your heroes.  Basically, your heroes level up over time like in a Role-playing game, and the way you control them is like a strategy game.  This is actually quite a good mixture.  It worked in Warcraft III, and it works perfectly here.  However, there is more to the gameplay than just that.  This game pits two mighty teams against each other (the radiant and the dire).  One side is noticeably more heroic, guarding a lush green forest, while the other is noticeably darker, guarding an ashen wasteland.  The overall goal is to destroy the enemy team's ancient (base of operations).  To do this, you really need to coordinate with your teammates, and let them know what is happening around the battlefield.  I think that this is a very good approach, especially considering that the game is entirely multiplayer.  The graphics of this game are also quite good.  Everything is quite beautiful, and enjoyable for anyone who loves video game graphics.  There is no real story to this game, which although I have criticized in the past, I don't feel the need to here.  All of the characters in this game have their own stories to read if you ever want a good story in this game.  There is only one real complaint that I have with this game as a matter of fact.  This game does have a very steep learning curve.  It is easy to learn, but incredibly difficult to master.  You need to find a hero that suits your playstyle, which if you ask me, can take ages to figure out considering that there are over one-hundred of them.  However, having over one-hundred heroes is not a bad thing.  In fact, I'd say it's a great thing.  It gives you so much more variety on what kind of hero you can play as.  Overall, I'd say that this is another fantastic game by VALVe software.  It is ultra-competitive, fast, furious, and one heck of a lot of fun.  It's steep learning curve may be a tad bit problematic, however, that does not stop me from awarding this game with a 9 out of 10.",cub317

Some players may be put of by environments being smaller than those in previous entries to the series, but from the start of the mach until the score readout, Battlefield is one journey you don't want to miss.With no campaign to play through, Battlefield can sometimes feel like a game that was not completely finished. This is counteracted though by beautiful and well designed environments, all of which have had an amazing level of detail that just wont be found anywhere else. Maps vary from small, tropic covered war zones, to large, open ended dessert battlefields, all of which are a breeze to get around thanks to a number of widely appreciated vehicles. You can step into the helm of a helicopter or jet and tear up the skies, causing endless waves of destruction on the enemies underneath you, or sit behind the controls of a tank, or the wheel of a car. Battlefields huge environments are the factor that brings the game home.Whats a war game without Action? When you select a map for an online battle or a single player experience, you can choose from a list of well designed classes, all imperative to the success of your team. You can be an engineer, repairing vehicles and turning the tide in battle as a result, or a heavy weapons operative, sporting an explosive firing missile launcher that can stop the enemy driving into your base with a tank. No matter what your choice is, there's a class for everyone, and everyone feels like the team relies on them as much as anyone else.Battlefield 2 and all of it's added content deserves a solid 9.5 out of 10.",thecowofbeef

This time through I finally made it to the end, or at least until the game just broke down and I couldn't progress. I gave it a 6 not just because of the bugs, but because the game was lacking in a lot of ways. Since I played it many times I've been everywhere and now, done I've been playing this game for nearly 10+ years, but I'd never get very far until recently. This time through I finally made it to the end, or at least until the game just broke down and I couldn't progress. I gave it a 6 not just because of the bugs, but because the game was lacking in a lot of ways. Since I played it many times I've been everywhere and now, done everything except for the cathedral, and I've got to say it's not even close to how great I thought it would be. I thought it would have powerful storylines actually shaped by the players events since at the beginning it gives that illusion. Sadly, as the game went on and neared the end things just went down hill. (SPOILERS) I did the whole side story of helping the Blades in the Boneyard defeat the Regulators after I was lucky enough to find the alien gun somewhere. When I finished, nothing changed. Some npcs died but no one reacted any different. In fact the only thing that really changed was the Gun Runners, after killing off the deathclaws they gave me better deals at there store. (/Spoilers) So the most interesting change the player could ever do in this game (besides progress to the ""end"" of the game, was to get better deals from some merchant? I expected much better from the supposed ""Best RPG of all time"". Now for all I know it was just bugs, since closely after that bugs just broke the game. I finished the quest with the brotherhood and gained access and then talked to the elders. (Spoilers) I scouted the military base out, then came back. And this is where the game hit rock bottom... They told me to go to the base and get inside. So I did, and to my surprise the soliders they sent with me didn't come in with me, so I had to fight an entire base of mutants by myself. So I did, and when I got to the end I killed the boss and left. But no one back at the brother hood says anything new to me, they don't say ""Good job, here's your power armor"" nothing. (/spoilers) So I'm left with nothing, no where to go, nothing to do. Besides some major bugs the game is still pretty mediocre. I had thought the story and player interaction in shaping the world was the best feature of the game, so I never minded the subpar combat, the linear dialogue or the failed attempt at what Deus Ex did so well, CHOICE. In Deus Ex you never have to fight, you can hack, lockpick and sneak your way to the end of levels, but Fallout forces you into every role. And if you can't fight then your screwed. If I never found the secret alien gun then I probably would not have gotten very far, since deathclaws were near impossible without it.",RyanB

For a franchise that has seen it's hits and misses, Nintendo finally seems to have cultivated a thorough understanding of how best to combine the classic platforming elements with fresh new gameplay mechanics that no one else has done before, and on a system that, until now, has seemingly been relegated to hosting gimmicky, half-hearted attempts at innovation. Everything that makes a Mario game classic, fun and challenging is here, but don't let the first half of the game fool you. The ease with which you will conquer it only serves as a method of drawing you in.  It's when you get to the special stages that the difficulty ramps up significantly, and the challenge is nearly impossible to ignore.  You will not want to put the game down.  You will want to finish every level, collect every star coin and get every golden flag.  With the addition of Luigi, whose jumps are slightly higher and whose run is slightly faster, the gameplay changes just enough to keep from getting stale on the 2nd play through, then the unlocks keep you coming back for more.  By the time I unlocked the final crown level, I had died hundreds of times, cursing and shouting, nearly driving my wife insane.  Then I played the crown level.  Anyone who says this game is too easy, obviously hasn't played it enough to unlock this level.  If you want an even greater challenge, do what I did and don't use the Tanooki suit.  Further still, try beating it without using the moving platform that Nintendo mercifully provides for you at the end of the level.  You'll know what I mean when you get there.  Admittedly, once you play the level hundreds of times, you'll know how to conquer it rather easily, but it is a steep learning curve.But let's not forget the graphics.  They are stunning, easily rivaling and in some cases surpassing that of the Mario Galaxy counterparts.  The 3D effect only sweetens the deal and Nintendo even found a way to incorporate the effect into the gameplay as well.  At no point while playing did I ever want to switch it off, which isn't something I can say for other games on the 3DS.  It was never a distraction, at least for me.   Nintendo has crafted a beautiful environment to immerse players in and the polish is pristine.  The animations are also top notch.  Smooth and seamless, this game is a joy to look at and play.I really can't speak highly enough about this game.  It is a masterpiece and a must-own for anyone who has a 3DS.  For someone who doesn't always have time to sit through a 30 to 40 hour gameplay experience, Super Mario 3D Land is a perfect match.  Not too long, not too short.  Everything is just right.

The developers have released two patches to address issues and community concerns already. I have 28 hours of playtime under my belt and I can honestly say this is the most fun I have had in a video game in over a decade. A single player video game, even longer. The Witcher 3 is a 10/10, CD Projekt Red has hit a home run with this one guys.The main difference between this game and other RPGs is the quests are all wonderful. Every side-quest is well thought out and fun to complete. There is absolutely none of that ""kill 10 x and loot 8 y"" nonsense that plagues modern RPGs like a pox. Everything I have experienced in this game has been consistently enriching and enjoyable. The Witcher 3 even comes loaded with a full-blown TCG that is associated with quests lines of its own that span the entire continent. I have enjoyed traveling from village to village to challenge innkeepers and win their special cards as much as I have enjoyed hunting monsters during witcher contracts.It has been a long time since I felt the need to eagerly listen to and dissect every piece of dialogue in a video game. The voice acting is top notch, leading to wonderful, compelling character encounters. In terms of side-quests there is so much to do, so many monsters to hunt, so many problems to solve, and so many Gwent cards to win that most players will find themselves completely overwhelmed in the best possible way.The combat is a stellar improvement over The Witcher 2, adapting to the type of monster you're encountering is probably the most exciting part for me. Bringing down a wyvern with a crossbow just feels wonderful, binding a wraith to the physical plain to do maximum damage really immerses you in the game. Preparing for a tough monster during a contract quest feels great, going in knowing you're prepared for the situation is as rewarding as collecting the sweet sweet loot after.It has been a long long time since a game convinced me it is occurring in its own world, but the Witcher 3 does it. The last time I felt this way was Ultima Online, circa 1997. Like I said at the beginning of my review, The Witcher 3 is a 10/10.",ThinkSamich

There is little to no character customization. Plot is cookie-cutter boring, if not stupid, and is the same regardless of the class chosen (thus making replay or even experimenting with different classes) less of a draw for me. Voice acting is staid. The RPG elements, as others have pointed out, esp. the skill trees, are watered down, restrictive and mostly uninteresting. Character and plot progression are narrow and over-directed. Dungeons and environments are used and re-used ad nauseum (did they not learn from DA2?). Despite all these shortcomings I continue to play it; continue to click, click, click away, going on 16 hours now. The combat, power animations and baddie destruction is slick and fully satisfying, despite it all coming down to mindless button mashing.  I'm compelled by some powerful Pavlovian impulse that Blizzard has tapped into (and that I was somehow immune to with WoW and Starcraft). So I've resigned myself to finishing the story and then perhaps playing some co-op, although I suspect the screen will be a complete mess of explode-y, obscuring animations when I do.

Seriously... Why the **** is this trash a full price game? LOL!These games are made for the stupid... Sorry to offend people who bought it but it's true lol. Hear me out...Micro transactions. Corporate greed. More money that they don't need. Many companies that work harder don't do this crap... But companies like crapdivision like to do it because they are super greedy and don't give a crap about how great of a video game experience you will have. Nothing says EF you to the customer more than this. A system designed to pressure suckers into wasting money.The developers only have so much precious time to work on the game in order to make it better and better. A game is only as good as how much work goes into it for the most part. They could be spending ALL of their time making it as good as possible but what do they do instead? They cut out a huge chunk of their time in order to implement a scam your wallet system. This isn't for the gamers... You're an insane idiot if you think that... Wake up! It's for corporate gains. Which means this is a game with no heart. No soul. It was designed to trick stupid people into thinking it's good while ripping them off big time. This isn't a matter of opinion. It's a fact that it's not a very impressive shooter compared to the greats I listed above and it's clearly designed to rip you off and pressure you into wasting more and more money on stuff that's only worth while to idiots with tiny brains/low standards. If you are one of these suckers then you seriously need to stop buying these games...And don't give me that ""I love the game and never bought micro transactions""1... You're a idiot so of course you would love something mediocre/terrible.And 2... Even if you're telling the truth about not buying micro transactions (I don't believe you because you're a moron who's into this game in the first place)....... But if you are being truthful... Think to yourself right now... Think hard about something that I'm going to ask you here...Have you ever saw a micro transaction and felt some what tempted to buy it? The answer will be yes. As you grind and grind and grind senselessly whilst bored as hell... You're going to get a feeling that tells you that if you buy micro transactions, your grind will be shortened. Of course you're going to feel that way. That's what this system does. It's designed to tempt you into doing something that's totally not worth it. And that's what's wrong with it...It's a dirty trick and only idiots fall for it. Sadly most gamers are idiots which is why micro transactions are super popular in video games today. It's bad enough just about all of our multiplayer games are getting screwed like this... But it's happening to single player games too. The new Shadow of War will have them. How lame is that? DLC is bad enough as it's usually over priced weak sauce that should have come with the game. But micro transactions are really pushing it as they can cost you close to thousands if you go overboard like a idiot. My advice? Ignore games like this altogether... Besides... No micro transaction game EVER falls into the category of greats like ocarina of time, chrono trigger, smash bros melee, metal gear solid, star craft 1 etc etc... Why play a dumb ass over priced micro transaction game that's mediocre at best when you could be playing the best of the best? You know deep down that you're not missing out when you pass up a game like theftiny poo.Lets talk about the game play... Many shooters take a bit of skill to master. The good players can pull off some impressive stuff from time to time. You see that in shooters like the older ones. Quake, counter strike, halo ce... YOU DON'T see that in crap like Theftiny poo. In theftiny poo you see high auto aim, bullet magnetism, and super powers that any scrub can get good at abusing. The skill gap isn't that high. It's a game for dude bros. It's not for the skilled. It's for cod kids lol.The story... Part 1 didn't have a story and this one does but it's corny, short, and not interesting. The only good thing about it is a few jokes I guess but you shouldn't buy a game like this for its story. You can watch that for free on youtube.Content is low as crap. People beating the game in just a few hours and then what's left to do? Grind grind grind... Yawn...Maybe it gets to about a 7 out of 10 once all the DLC is released one day but at that point the game is massively over priced. It's already overpriced as it is. It's not even a expansion lol. I seen free games offer more than this haha! So I give it a 3 out of 10 for being the scum of gaming. Games like this are what's making new video games these days fail miserably.",iamevilhomer

I'd like to address the dissenters who are complaining about the game and through that, also point out the positives of the game. First of all, if Metacritic is deleting your reviews, it's because you are giving a game a ""0"" that is clearly a 7 at bare minimum. I honestly can't think of any game I've ever played literally being a ""0,"" and honestly I don't think the dissenters have either. Over exaggeration and trolling should be deleted. It's good they are deleting your reviews, because to be honest, you're just trolling and damaging the reputation of a company based on your own obnoxious behavior. No one has time to put up with little 15 year olds and their complaining. In regards to the complaints about the game as a PC port, the game was ported over very well. The controls are great and they give you a large amount of personal customization. I find it funny people are calling it a bad port, yet have no reasons for making this assertion. The graphics are excellent as well, it is a cell shaded game, so if you dislike cell shading, then you won't like these graphics. However, to say the game has bad graphics is a lie, because for what it is, the graphics are detailed, crisp, and vibrant. I'm playing on a 1080p display with the graphics maxed and visually, it is very pleasing. Even on the lower graphic levels, the game is still better than the graphics on the original and looks better than any console game. I've also seen people complain about day 1 DLC, however, this is entirely false. There is no DLC released for Borderlands 2 yet, and most of it, if any, won't be released until 2013. What 2k is offering is a season pass, meaning if you buy the season pass, which will include access to ALL DLC released for this game FOREVER, you can buy the DLC at one low cost. It's basically a way for fans of the game to get large quantities of future DLC at a lower cost then buying individually. Think bulk purchase. If you were to be upset about that, then it seems your general complaint is about DLC in general, which is an absolutely foolish complaint. The game play mostly consists of shooting, looting, and questing. I personally enjoy that, and it if sounds appealing to you, then you will probably like this game. If not, then oh well.

The graphics and presentation in general, from the voice acting to the soundtrack are all top notch, and the questing is greatly improved over the first game and far better than many other fantasy games that make up for a lack of imagination with lots of repetition (Dragon Age 2 in particular). The combat is also far more active than many fantasy RPGs, with a perfect level of difficulty on the normal setting that keeps combat tense and exciting for the 30+ hour adventure, and the multiple playthroughs that follow. But the obvious highlight of the game is the story, which is far more mature than many other supposedly ""dark"" videogame stories. Filled with memorable characters, awesome epic battles, lots of political intrigue as well as an incredible number of morally ambiguous choices to make that will greatly affect how the game unfolds, the story in TW2 is one of the best stories in a videogame ever, only slightly surpassing that of Dragon Age 2 thanks to the fact that all the story elements in TW2 are connected to the overarching plot, unlike DA2, which felt more like 3 separate stories all meshed together. Overall, TW2 is simply an amazing game and a serious contender for GOTY. It's got beauty, action, story and lots of replay value, and it should not be missed by anyone who values a good story-driven action RPG, or just a great game in general.",IronGuy410

After playing it for over 20 hours I can safely say that it has lived up it's predecessor's standards.  The new guns, vehicles, and the new Frostbite 2 engine run perfectly.  Although there are some hitches in the gameplay in the middle of a match.  I noticed that sometimes some of the gadgets glitch and end up not doing anything, for example one time one of my squad mates got killed right next to me and so I took out my defibrillator to revive him, but no matter how hard I tried i couldn't revive him.  There are just small hitches in the game, most of the time they aren't noticeable but on rare occasions they can hinder your gameplay.  Now I will move to the Campaign, it is not very good, at all, compared to the multiplayer experience single player suffers greatly.  The campaign consists of 1 minute of gunplay and then a quick time event, also the AI is far to easy at some points, and then at other points, the AI is so difficult I die after 2 seconds.  The campaign is not good at all, but the multiplayer is where it is at.  I would give this game a perfect ten for an innovative multiplayer but unfortunately a single player campaign was added and it dragged the game down.

Maybe i was hoping for DA:O sequal. The game does have improvment at some points. The combat is more fun now, it isnt clunky and the animations are smooth. It was nice to see my rogue just kill stuff with style. The spells and skills look nice, First time i casted rock armor i was amazed how much better it looked compared to DA:O. The new Qunari look nice, but in the game you dont see any female Qunari's also you dont see any female Dwarfs. The dialogue wheel is something they tried to take over from ME2, but it dosent fit for DA2. In a rpg i wanna be the character and choose what i say like i did in DA:O, but with the new dialogue wheel i often felt like i didnt bother reading any options. Making me pay less attention to the story. I always knew top was good, middle was neutral and bottom was evul. So i always clicked the top one and didnt bother reading anything else. Which was a huge letdown. In DA:O you had so many diffrent choices and you chose the option which felt what you would have said so you were thinking what you would do, you were in the game. Also the dialogue options were sometimes confusing, because i hoped it to say something diffrent and it kept me sometimes wondering if i pressed something wrong or could the other options say what i wanted to say.Companions:Companion customization is dumbed down. You can't change ur companion armor, except rings,necklace, belt and weapon. In a rpg i always want to customize all my characters. Or maybe it was too much to expect. 1,5 years to make a sequal isnt that much, comparing to DA:O and i guess Bioware didnt have the time to make armors for your companions. But not being able to change armors, resulted my main character who was a rogue, have more armor/defence than my tank. Even though you can upgrade your companion armors, by getting some special upgraders or doing companion quests it isnt as effective compared to DA:O, where you could give them your old set.Another thing about companions, you cant talk to them everytime you want. Basically if you want to know about them you need to wait for the companion quest to open. I always was checking all my companions, because i wanted to know about them more, but i never was able to talk with them unless they had a quest and that wasnt really what i was looking forward to. In DA:O you could talk with them everywhere, which was great, but now the only chance to talk with them is during companion quests and occasionaly cutscenes. In DA:O, you talked with them everytime gave them gifts, laughed at their jokes and dialogues, but now it feels like they removed it from the game. True the companions to have funny dialogue with eachother from time to time, but here i don't bother listening to them at all, unless its Varrick whos talking. Varrick will probably be the companion i will remeber. Compared to DA:O, where i loved Alistair, Morrigan, Shale, Zevran, Oghren and so on. The companions in DA2 arent that memorable.The theme is Kirkwall, you spend all the time in Kirkwall and its surrounding places. Kirkwall is a huge city and you can choose to visit at night and day, which is nice, but the city is empty. I mean there arent npc-s. The huge city seems kinda empty, but that isnt a big problem, the biggest problem is the dungeons and recycled areas. After ACT1 you will spend ur time revisiting the places u visited for several more times. Basically after ACT1 you have seen the whole game. Compared to DA:O, where there were so many diffrent places, citys this seems like they didnt have money or the time to make new dungeons. After revisiting a dungeon the 20-th time you know where the most treasures are and it isnt as rewarding and the game lacks exploration.What is the deal with DLC before the game is even released. They are trying to milk too much money out of the gamers who like the Dragon Age universe. There are 2 dlc-s already, which 1 has a new companion and the other has some bonus items. You can play DA2 without dlc-s easily, because those dlc don't add that much depth to the game. Also on hard/nightmare the game is challenging, however some places are unbalanced and make you wanna tear your hair out. To play on nightmare you gotta exploit all the weakness and the stupidness of the enemys ai. The game started feeling like hit and run. The game isnt as tactical as DA:O, yes you can play it tactically, but after waves and waves of enemys ur tactics mostly end up being useless, because enemy's come out of nowhere and just take out ur mage or rogue. So you never can be prepeared.Dont get me wrong Dragon Age 2 is a good game, but i always kept comparing it to DA:O. DA2 was rushed out, it wasnt polished like DA:O. If there wasnt DA:O i would give DA2 a score of 8, but it felt for me that it isnt as good as DA;O and i always compared to it. So imma give it a 7.",wiwefak

Now, as far as remakes go, Star Fox 64 3D is impressive in that it's both very faithful to the original material and has changed enough to make the game feel fresh. Nintendo EAD and Q-Games, the joint developers, have really pushed the graphical capabilities of the 3DS to make this game look, frankly, beautiful. Anyone who's played the original game will be able to appreciate the sheer increase in detail of the environments and characters, particularly the Corneria and Venom stages. The 3D effect has been toned down for Star Fox 64 3D, something I consider a wise move from Nintendo as I don't feel the fast and hectic nature of this game would have complimented an intense 3D effect. It would have hindered gameplay and done a number on the player's eyes no doubt. The gameplay is relatively simple. Fans of the N64 version know what to expect, and newcomers can learn the ropes fairly easily. You move forward automatically on a fixed path and you shoot or dodge whatever tries to get in your way. You'll find in some stages your actions can influence the path that you take, leading you to an easier/harder route, a different boss, or even an alternate stage upon completion. Multiple paths and medals awarded for high scores gives this very short game (about an hour to an hour and a half from start to end) heaps of replay value, and that's not even considering the new gyroscope-controlled 3DS mode, which is an easier version of main game controlled completely through physically moving the 3DS. It essentially doubles the amount of stuff you have to do to 100% the game. No game is without it's shortcomings however, and Star Fox 64 3D has a bit too many for my liking. Most prominent of said shortcomings is the distinct lack on online multiplayer. It was recently revealed by Nintendo that the development team didn't want to simply tack on an online mode (despite doing so with many games in the past) so just omitted it altogether. Considering Star Fox fans have been waiting for some form of online mode for years and that this was a perfect opportunity, I see the exclusion as extremely disappointing. There's also the similarly unforgivable lack of the original voice acting. Star Fox 64 was infamous for it's voice acting and dialogue, which was the definition of so-bad-it's-good. Granted, they hired a lot of the same voice actors for the new voice-overs and recreated the tones and the accents impressively well for every character, but honestly is it so hard to put in an option for the original voices? It baffles me, it really does.One minor gripe I had as well was with the control scheme for ""N64 mode"", in particular the circle pad, the means of navigation. It takes some getting used to because it seems as if the aiming or aiming sensitivity is a bit off. When first playing the game I found it significantly more difficult to hit targets that I would have otherwise done with ease on the original version. Practice has made this less of a problem, but I still run into trouble from time to time, especially when the action picks up in later levels. So that's something to watch out for. Overall, it's a faithful and impressive remake. The new voices are surprisingly well done,but I'll perpetually be disappointed with the inability to experience the original voices in the remake. I can't fault the graphical side of things because it really is beautiful, and there's plenty of replay value to keep both fans and newcomers entertained for a while. The lack of an online mode is unforgivable however. A massive wasted opportunity and a void that single-cart local multiplayer simply can't fill. If you're looking for a fun and addictive single-player experience that's easy to play in short bursts or for hours on end, this is for you.",Gladimus

Solid framerate and 0 bug during all the playthrough, precise hit-box for all the characters, responsive controls, etc. The game is perfect on this ground.Now about the gameplay it's basically genuine for the 2D platformer genre, with very few new ideas, but the formula didn't need to change so I'll not consider this as a con for the game, there is a good curve of difficulty in the game between the super easy first world to the hardcore last world where the game is almost a Die & Retry, specially the levels on rails or rocket. Concerning the wiimote controls there is a slight problem here, all the skills are based on the same movement and a particular tilt of the joystick in the nunchuck and therefore many times I died rolling over a platform when I only wanted to breeze the flower at the edge, this could have been change during testing. But globally the game is very fun with some challenge that will frustrate you just enough to give you a good feeling of accomplishment.Like all good platformers the game is full of collectible and bonus stages and if you look for everything the game should last about 20 hours, which is very good, unfortunately I will have the same criticism that I have for almost all Nintendo games, where is the story ? The little there is could have been written by a 6 year old, in my opinion they should really change that and give more importance to the characters and purpose, even more when the universe of the game is very rich like in Donkey Kong.All in all Donkey Kong Country Returns is a great 2D platformer with a handful of content, challenging levels, good bosses, fun gameplay (with one minor default on the mapping of the controls) that I'll definitively advice to old-school players looking for a retro platformer, but not to story oriented players.",BaronMonaco

228190,Halo 3: ODST,Xbox360,7,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        The actual game itself holds well on its own. As a downed ODST trooper, you spend the game moving around the city of New Mombasa, searching for your squad mates. The gameplay is as tight as a regular run of the mill HALO installment, and the story holds its own as well. This game doesn't come without its faults, however. The characters are shoddy, in terms of personality and actual physical design. When halo fans hear the term, ODST, the first image that comes to mind is a tatted-out, physically peaked killing machine. Basically a step below Spartans. However when you play through the different characters and their stories, you get the feeling that these squad mates are nothing more than goofy, hapless grunts. My second qualm came from the lack of Halo 2 tech. ODST takes place, in the halo timeline, in Halo 2, where brutes were only just making their appearance, elites were still the majority fighting force in the Halo 'verse. However you don't fight a single one in the campaign! Also, the assault rifle and chopper return, without the battle rifle. The entire campaign experience just felt like a Halo 3 recreation. Now, my main issue is my belief that the popularity of the package itself came majorly from the second disk, which contained the bonus Halo 3 multiplayer map packs and other miscellaneous content. If ODST had been an individual project, with all work focused on the game, without the halo 3 map pack, I believe it could've been a completely changed, for the better, superb game. Unfortunately, what with the inclusion of the map pack, in the end all ODST was was an extension that should have been something much bigger and grander than what it was made to be.",Jryan

The aesthetics where so bad they where flatout broken, nothing was lit, everything was sickening. Under all these elements that I hated about saints row 2, was some potential. It has a **** of side content, most of which was insane. And it has some great storyline missions. Saints row 3 reduces side content, one of the major draws of the average original. So does that make it worse then? Not at ALL. The game looks great, runs great, feels like a game, instead of cardboard boxes moving around. Now while the actual content is less diverse, and this is about 1/3rd the size and diversity of saints row 2 - it's a FAR better game. Mechanics, the feel of controls, all these things do matter. The presentation matters. And while I would certainly prefer saints row 3 to have the content of saints row 2 - I actually completed saints row 3. Whereas I feel phisically ill every time I play 2. These little details add up. It's also got more of a tone than saints row 2. It's own sense of style that separates it from everything else. It does insanity better, it takes that extra step towards being it's own entity. In the end, I think saints row 3 is a fantastic game that is too short. Whereas saints row 2 is a absolutely terrible game that is very long. Hopefully saints row 4 can have a lot of content, while keeping the style and feel of 3. That would be a 9/10 right there.",whitespider999

MultiplayerThe major Call of Duty fanboys will defend COD games regardless of what was served up by Activision and the developers but as an unbiased gamer I can give a true and accurate review. The campaign is not great which is expected given past form. It is very rare to see a top quality FPS single player and I would say the last top quality ones were Half Life 2 and Episode 1 & 2. Multiplayer though is even worse and any comments about this being MW 2.5 are well justified. Visuals and audio are second rate and the map design is poor with maps being too small and quickly forgettable. Then there is the fact that there are still no dedicated servers which makes online gaming still a game of chance and don't believe this nonsense they have spouted about dedicated servers costing 'billions of dollars' as it is complete lies. The fact is the Call of Duty series is living off the success of COD 4 which was a good game in its day but the last three instalments have been well below standard. The series is simply now aimed at the 15 and under who will insist it is still brilliant but take it from someone who knows what is quality and what is not. This is just not good enough.,KentuckyWindage

I also see lots of 10s because ""OH MY GOD IT'S SO AWESOME"" - grow up, your opinion is also crap.Please bear with me for a well-explained statement on why this game isn't terrible, but also not as good as most of you make it out to be.Firstly, the core movement and combat mechanics are taken from the Assassin's Creed and the Arkham series. Games have been copying off other games for decades and if it works, who am I to judge, no real problem here. However, the Arkham combat is very simplistic. It looks guttural and feels satisfying to kill enemies - for about 10 minutes. Afterwards you will realize that you have very little impact on the combat and one press of a button will initiate finishing moves of several seconds. Combat is akin to a visual novel, not a video game.More ways to go about combat open up with rising level - some even change the way you go about combat slightly, but none of them truly stand out and in the end it's more of the ""very low effort - high (visual) reward""-bullcrap that AC and Arkham have been pushing. This is a game for casual gamers. Whether you take that statement as an insult is up to you.What's more - the Story, apart from being ridiculously slow (you could easily finish the main campaign and most of the side quests in less than 15 hours) is bland, boring and forgettable. You don't care about any of the characters because they have onedimensional personalities at best. ""I lust for revenge"" ""I am the comic relief"" ""I am a woman and in need of help"" ""I am evil"" ... blergh.What's worse than the story? The way it is presented. Most Main Quests require of you to follow a friendly NPC around and GOD FORBID you move more than 5 meters away from him even though it's perfectly clear to you what to do next. No, no you filthy peasant, you better **** wait until the game allows you to pursue your next objective. Call of Duty-esque messages like ""YOU ARE LEAVING THE MISSION AREA""  will haunt you. Additionally,[VERY MILD SPOILER]the final boss fight is one of the most laughable encounters of the last decade, seriously. I have never felt so unsatisfied in my life.    [/spoiler]    Now, what does that leave us with? Weapon challenges, surely. The missions itself are very welldone and even mildly (really, MILDLY) challenging - after all this is a casual modern game for casual modern gamers. But what's the reward for doing all 10 missions for a weapon? Uh, 10 glowy bits on it. Really, that's it. No awesome additional elemental effects, no new moves, **** nothing. Great.There are several other types of side quests which are tolerable, I suppose. I couldn't really be arsed to do the slave-freeing missions myself after the first two, but that might just be my personal taste.Now, one feature I actually do like. The ""Sauron's Army"" system. You can identify captains, dominate them, pitch them against each other, protect your branded ones against ambushes and ensure they're victorious in challenges to help them advance and eventually become bodyguards and assassinate their warchiefs. Nice little system. Too bad you can't access the fun part of it (branding and dominating captains) until around 70% of the campaign have passed.Oh, fun fact: That team of war chiefs you've been training and improving? Yeah, they're gone after the final mission.Get this game when it's on a budget or if you know about ways to acquire it without paying. It is not worth the full price if you've got half a brain.If you, however, enjoy intense action that you have little to no impact on and are otherwise above actually contributing to a video gaming experience, get it.

I personally consider it a bit of a non-canon 'emo' phase for an otherwise hip-hop funk-fest of a series) I have to say SSX (2012) was disappointing to say the least.I can't deny having the same sinking feeling when presented with what many were calling a 'Call of Duty'-esque sneak-peak trailer - a real juxtapose to one of the original SSX trailers which is essentially various in-game sequences of the funkadelic cast smacking each other, busting ridiculous flips and smashing through glass to the soundtrack of some bad-boy jungle for the best part of 30 seconds - and likewise when it finally came to crunch time: there it was - all the spiralling, speed and slope shooting but none of the outrageous characters and charm that made the original series more than just high-octane racing with ridiculous tricks: it was high octane racing with ridiculous tricks set in a universe just as outrageous.I had no qualms whatsoever with the revived classic characters, in fact I loved how they had aged, as they always did, naturally, from series to series, relative to the years between titles. But where once upon a time you could kit out your riders with different board types and apparel, full 3D renders, catchphrases, animations and all, now it's all conceptual art with an infinity style variation of everything - the most you can do to change your characters wears is the rendered skin colour... dude you used to be able to give Moby some mad dreads, get Mac riding on a Dollar Bill, Put cowboy stuff on Nate and what prepubescent teenager wasn't dressing Elise in the skimpiest shorts and bunny ears? It was that kind of character personalisation and immersion that took the game to a next level - that and the classic: split-freakin'-screen! Live racing dude! Besting someone's time is one thing but whaaaat!? You can't even race online players live in the 2012 revamp? Seriously?I wasn't expecting much from the ever-increasingly monopolised EA, especially considering the founding father BIG studio was no more. But really? SSX used to have a cool, underground sonic aesthetic - now the soundtrack consists of DJ Fresh and Skrillex... where's the subterranean beats EA? That 'cool' vibe? You used to have Mix Master mike on deck dudes... then you pulled in the genuinely likeable DJ Atomica - now we have to put up with an inaudible dude in a heli who sure ain't no disc jockey. You lost your steeze and invested purely in sell-value, and you flopped because of it. Sure you pulled some pennies on this project but you missed the boat that made this series rock - you didn't take any risks whatsoever.You amped up the action value because hey, everyone wants blockbuster action in their video games in the 21st century, right? Wrong - indie's on the rise because as much as we love our Uncharted and our GTAs, we like zany madness too guys! We like abstract and silly. And there are generations of millenials stuck in the backend of a disgusting recession who's housing options are increasingly sharing flats/houses: that's thousands of one of the biggest gaming markets sat in shared living rooms making do with Fifa and Mortal Kombat for shared screen multilayer experiences - swapping controllers to take turns doing laps on Dirt... SSX without Splitscreen or the ability to race real human beans, live, is just... flat man. Flat as it comes.And no punching? No social connections? No Zoe is friends with Moby and Moby hates Elise and Kaori hates Psymon and blah blah blah? Whaaaat!? No big bios. No custom trick-set ups? No tracks based anywhere bar back-country and off piste? What no crowd stands and fireworks and loop the loops and ""DO NOT ENTER"" glass signs to break through and take the lead? No standing ovation on the podiums? No TOKYO MEGAPLEX REVAMP!? WHAT ARE YOU DOING!? All the steez - all the swagger - all the funk: dropped in place of wing suits, ice picks and oxygen tanks...Hey the danger element is cool. Bring it on. Bring it in. I love it. I love the gear, especially that wing-suit. But don't give us those cool bonuses and then tear away the heart and freaking soul of this game? It's the same body, the speed, the tricks, the fluidity, but none of the heart. None of the personality. No flare.Oh and grinding is now a glue-stuck to the rail affair - no skill required - you used to have to be a bossman to boss rails... now all you have to do is hop on and ride - too easy to become a master by finding the best path on this game. 2012 flopped - do better!",JoshBtB

The first is as a New IP, the second as a sequel to an Old IP.As a new IP, the game direction, design and style is not that bad. Blizzard has the budget to back up quality in the product and it shows, from the wonderfully detailed menus, to everything, it is simply polished up real nice. What starts to then weaken it is the fact that it really seams simple in it's structure, especially for a game being developed for so long and especially for a hack and slash game released on 2012. Expectations are far beyond what was given from a company with such a budget and resources as Blizzard, but expectations are also larger from what is actually possible in such a game and genre in our time.The length was quite short. The story was ok-ish. Included DRM and other online things that simply shouldn't be there for a game like this. Limited party size, to simply later reveal that the game was indeed aimed for consoles as well.I have nothing against a game being also made for consoles, as long as it doesn't take out features from the PC version just to do this, the way Diablo 3 did. The game felt 5 years old and that is the best that can be said about it as a new IP, no matter how polished it was. The game ends up being marginally a 5/10 as it doesn't deliver in a surprisingly new way neither lives up to the expectations of a company as large as Blizzard and so much time being put into it. RAGE from id was longer, for crying out loud, and it was a first person shooter. Skyrim took around the same time to develop, and the results show why. Diablo 3 does not convince in any way that it is a project taken seriously, especially with regards to the original fans, which takes us to part 2.Reviewing it as the sequel to the original franchise (which is the true review) the game is simply not Diablo. Diablo 2 delivered, in size and content 4 times that of the original, and it kept to the original style which is what the Diablo universe was all about that Lovecraft styled and gothic demonic look and atmosphere created. Something that the previous Blizzard employees that actually worked on and made Diablo 1 and 2 managed to recreate on their next project, Hellgate.The direction was a slap in the face. It is like playing the TES universe and the third iteration being in a completely different direction than the other two. Blizzard saw into simply scrapping the original franchise and making something new, make it marginally as long as the previous titles if not shorter (much shorter actually), get rid of entire features, apply it to consoles, use the old franchise name and their own to sell and advertise it, and deliver a product that did nothing of create the feeling the old titles created. Art direction was mostly changed to appeal to a larger scale target market as well, also evident in the fact that it was ultimately aimed at console launches as well.To further prove that they really don't give a damn about the old franchise, neither the fans, at the complaint on the new direction and art for Diablo 3 from many fans, they released a troll Cow Level with rainbows claiming that ""this is childish"", not Diablo 3. Hardly the approach of a serious company, but rather the actions of a child arguing it's point, going completely out of their way to simply try and prove they are right.They are not right, not by a long-shot. The feel of the original franchise which was spectacular simply wasn't there, it was something else. The Cthulu-ish designs and dark sinister world worthy of the name Diablo was scrapped, and they have the audacity to try and say otherwise even though the results are so evident? I am ashamed in them, and the title.Diablo 3 brought nothing new to the genre instead it simplified it, while it also ruined the original franchise, and instead of delivering at least an attempt to show that they put twice the work in it than previous Diablo titles, we get results that require half the effort. Path of Exile felt more like the original Diablo franchise, and it was a free to play game from an indie developer. The results Blizzard achieved here are appalling and not nearly in the lowest of their standards that we deserve to have. But then again, Blizzard hasn't been Blizzard since 2002.The game is barely 2/10. I would have given it 3/10, but Blizzards stance on it, the continuation of supporting their decision rather than admitting to fault, along with other things, drops it to 2/10... And I am being nice.",HazaRDReborN

Tying it into current political events would inseparably connect this game to 2018 and make it feel quite dated in the future. (Apart from the fact that it would feel a bit rich for the developers to take a stance on gun violence after you just mowed down 50 guys with a machine gun)",MovieNerd_EP

Not only it kills the fantasy of globally reducing the threat and leaving some places safer, but it becomes annoying after a while to cut through them again (and again...). I know it's a fairly common choice in games with leveling and role-play, but I just don't like it. I don't feel rewarded by money and loot. The better reward for me would have been : a simple ""gone forever"" zombie.- Lack of direction in open world. Even with quest and flags, I found the navigation pretty confusing : I had to go back and forth between the quest page, the map page, and the radar icon just to figure out how far a mission goal was. Add to this the relative ""openness"" of the world and I got myself lost and confused too many times for my taste.- Getting no assistance from the survivors. Except the introduction, most of the times I do the dirty work for all the survivors. The story tells me I'm immune, but considering the fact zombies are respawning, some brave assistance in the field would have been appreciated. If you add on top of this the fact some ""missions"" are self-centered (like ""bring me champagne"" from the russian girl) you just want them to die of their stupidity right here for not contributing to the greater effort.Dead Island has also minor negatives aspects ;- The way weapons are assigned on slots and selected by the mouse during play are counter-intuitive. Many time I found myself struggling with a simple equip action, or abandoning weapons for a moment just to switch one in my hand with one in my bag-pack.- It takes a looong time before you can get firearms so you have to bash or slash your way through hundreds of zombies before you can start to choose between a close combat and a ranged weapon.- The weapons become useless after a while due to leveling up and that bothers me. It's nice to have to manage your durability or ammunition resources, but it quickly turns to busywork at the workshop and number comparison. It's very common in RPGs, Some people like this, I just don't.- The world is filled with luggages with mini loot. I don't find fun the fact of searching each one of these, but if I don't I might just run out of money to repair and upgrade a more efficient weapon.I'm really sad the game didn't work out for me, because I enjoyed the idea of playing it.",ave

The following is for the veterans:This is just a dumbed down Oblivion. I have no idea what they have spent all these years working on, but it sure wasn't to improve the previous game in any way. There are some cute quests, there are some dragons to kill, but on the other hand everything looks like oblivion, the stats were removed and replaced with health, magicka, and stamina. Skills are no longer tied to stats, so there is no point in using light armor for anything but sneaking. When leveling up the world still levels up with you, and you get to picka a perk for every level. Most of them are of the character ""hey, i want to be able to use my spells"", ""please make irrelevant things easier for me"", and a few obviously useful ones, among them a sneak perk that lets you not make any noise when wearing heavy armor completely offsetting the last point of using light armor. Combat is more slow paced, difficulty seems to only affect the hp of things where killing a dragon or troll on the hardest is basically impossible as they regenerate faster than you can hurt them. If this wasn't part 5 of the elder scrolls series I think it would deserve a 7/10, but I'm giving it a 0 as there is no point in wasting your time on this worse experience if you already played oblivion or morrowind.

I thought dragons were supposed to be hard to kill and usually optional?).  In Dragon Age: 2, the identity crisis extends to the gameplay, where it either feels like a dumbed down version of Dragon Age: Origins, or a really bad God of War, depending on your personal preferences. This is really too bad because the dialogue is solid; they replaced the mute character of Dragon Age: Origins with a Mass Effect-style dialogue system and the story is decent enough for an RPG, in my opinion.

The whole Agent system has been so well thought-out, that it's one of the most exciting parts of the game. The battles are visually stunning and the small but balanced selection of units is nice. However the game isn't without its flaws. The multiplayer is nothing less than completely broken, not only in its matchmaking and room system, but also with a lot of unit behavior. Were it to work however, the avatar campaign system is an annoyance and prevents you from just jumping in with friends and playing how you want. Friends vs AI has also seemingly been removed for unknown reasons. When it comes to single-player bugs, there are less but still some real game-breakers. In one of the naval tutorial battles the player camera can barely move, this also happens in one of the historical battles, except this time it can also move through the floor and you are suddenly produced with an insane amount of screen fuzz half-way through - needless to say this historical battle remains incomplete for me. In my first campaign, part way through my income glitched and I went from 9k one turn to 172k the next. Having started again, I got through the campaign finishing the victory conditions, but chose to continue playing until I owned every province on the map. I owned all but two, when my game crashed and trying to reload either my quick saves or game saves would result in a crash - needless to say I've given up on this save file. As for the 'improved' AI, well, actually it's fairly thick. Besides simple things like sending cavalry round the sides to flank you, it really doesn't try and counter you at all. Infact, in trying to make it smart, they've made it incredibly annoying, as often it will run to the nearest large hill and turtle there waiting for you to advance. Seeing as it often starts nearer to said hill, more than you do, you have no way of stopping it - then it's just a matter of letting your archers kill theirs until they run out of archer units and rush down the hill at you. In sieges it's no better. Diplomacy also feels pointless and I barely bothered with it on my second campaign game, as I knew that as soon as I had gathered any momentum, realm divide would happen and every clan would turn against me. From this point onwards you get -5 to diplomatic relations every turn and there's no coming back from it. All this aside, it's still a fantastic game that I've already put in 100 hours in a short period of time, and definitely still worth getting. However with more thought put into how to mix up the later SP campaign (as opposed to realm divide), greater depth to diplomatic relations, a better (and working) MP system, and 'real' intelligent AI, it could have been a 10. Hopfully the modding community can do a lot to help some of these points, and because there's already several mods addressing some of these issues - and others generally enhancing the campaign experience, a game that would get a score of 8 out of the box, gets brought up to a score of 9 thanks to the community.",Deific

While not a terrible, it is incredibly average and simply feels outdated, as if it should have been released 4-5 years ago.

The game uses dynamic resolution and on occasion when things got heavy you could see a drop in resolution and some tearing.But the biggest issue when it comes to the singleplayer and the horde mode with the xbox one version is the low framerate. The game runs at 30fps except for VS multiplayer. It does hold 30 for the most part by sacrificing resolution when need be.The lower visuals I can take, but it is just not up to par in such a game to run such low frames. Especially coming from the buttery smooth pc version playing this feelt like a substantial sacrifice to gameplay and I did not feel enticed to keep playing.As for the game itself it is a Gears game, no more no less. It doesn't surprise and innovate really but it doesn't disappoint either.The shooting and action is solid albeit a bit repetetive, the whole game is moving from one area to the next doing the exact same thing. The game does not reward exploration and it doesn't mix the formula or gameplay style for variety. But what is there is good.Story is okay but got an abrupt ending wich left alot unexplained. I feel they could have fleshed out some bits a bit more.The singleplayer took me around 8-9h to complete on normal. Quite short. But there is replayability here. I will play the campaign again on a higher difficulty in coop once my friend gets the game. And then there is multiplayer VS or Horde mode to expand your playtime if you are into that.I would say that if you are a SP guy only and the multiplayer or coop does not interest you that much, then what this game offers might be a bit lacking and I'd rate it at around a 6/10 due to the short campaign and repetetive gameplay. But if you are into coop/multiplayer and because of the fact that it not only offers coop, it offers a full campaign coop to boot AND local coop even on the pc version... I will crank that score up a bit. However I also subtracted one point from this game on this xbox version compared to my score on the pc version simply because of the impact the **** performance on xbox one has in terms of gameplay. It is substantial.In the end I would recomend the game on pc first and foremost, but also on xbox one if you have no other choice. It's play anywhere, so you get both versions regardless without any extra cost.",Antioch

I've put serious time into the crafting/junk collecting and settlement building, and it has been great fun.  The game runs well on my PC, and I've heard of but have not encountered any significant bugs.  There is no FOV slider, which apparently is a huge issue to some gamers, but I don't care.Most importantly, I have fun playing this game.  Let me rephrase that.  Fallout 4 is a fun game.

MGR is probably the best example of a game being more than just the sum of its parts. The combat is a bit button-mashy (with slowly reacting AI) on lower difficulties, map design is mostly point A to point B, and the weapon variety is very limited. Somehow the game overcomes its shortcomings by combining ridiculous over-the-top cutscenes, a diverse OST with tracks ranging from traditional MGS-style ambience to blood-pumping boss themes, and a cast of uniquely difficult bosses that all feel like properly fleshed out worthy opponents for your anime cyborg ninja.Western devs are trying so hard to remove bosses and ""video gamey"" elements that when something like MGR comes along it feels like a breath of fresh air despite doing nothing revolutionary. MGR is a video game made by people who actually play video games and it shows. Bosses will beat techniques into you and make you get good, only to have the next boss require you to ""unlearn"" and adapt your previous strategies. MGR's bosses are an outstanding example of good game design in every way possible... I honestly can't remember the last time I played a game with such memorable boss fights.MGR manages to feel like an extension of MGS while standing on its own strengths. With a plausible plotline (within the MGS universe at least), charismatic bosses, a likable supporting cast, and actual character development in an action game, MGR creates something unique by smoothly melding a bevy of genre staples. I don't know if MGS fans will want to pick this up, but its hard to deny the adrenaline-pumping awesomeness of Metal Gear Rising.",suneater

You can climb walls by touching your next grapple point on screen, and when you climb ropes, you can do so in a realistic manner, by sliding your fingers in a repelling motion on the rear touch pad.

They really didn't innovate anything here, and those parts where you command units and tell them where to go etc, feels worthless and thrown in as a last minute attempt to be ""Different"" which failed miserably.I am done with the CoD series until they seriously do some work on it, these games have become bland and stale. So I will sum it up two stars only cause the Zombie mode is kind of fun (only when you have good people to play with) but the rest of this is a add-on with the CoD name slapped onto it.Luckily, I didn't buy this game, I borrowed from my brother and had it for a few weeks.

113312,Mass Effect 3,PC,6,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I have thought about what could be said about Mass Effect 3. I really wanted to like this game, I believe Mass Effect 1 was and still is the greatest Sci-Fi Rpg ever made. The second Mass Effect improved the fighting system and neutered the Rpg side of the game into oblivion. Mass Effect 2 was an adventure game that was just a fair game. But Bioware made it a lot better with dlc I played it again before the release of Mass Effect 3, it was long, the story made more sense. All in all it turned out to be a good game even though it was not the Rpg Masterpiece Mass Effect 1 was. Mass Effect 3, where does it fit into this? The problem is it does not. Seeing all the characters from the previous games was cool regardless of where the story took us. But the story only took us to the end. The big deal that everyone has made about the end? Silly you say? Bioware started it, the whole game is about the end, even when it is not being said, you feel it this is the end of the story. My seven year old daughter has that figured out. This is Bioware fault for making such a big thing about the end. With every step you know you are closer, with every familiar face you realize this is the last time you are going to see them. That is the story they choose to tell. They choose to shortcut any real story about what was going on, and made it about the journey to the end. If this game was the first in the series you would not see the inflated gamer scores on some of the web sites out there. You know who you are! ( Now Hang Your Head in Shame) this game is the first game that should be scored differently even though the story was bad, really bad. Even though the plot mechanics were bad, like talking to someone turning away and walking away only to find them sitting in the other room. Sliding down the ladder only to see you team at the bottom waiting for you, why did I have to deal with the ladder? And did not get to use magic like my team members? But seriously the art in this game is fantastic, it makes it a must own just for the art and environments the level designers created. The artist and level designers should start there own company. And hire some good writers to showcase their  awesome work. They were truly trying to make a great game, this is where the artist integrity was, in the art, not in the lame story or half baked ending. That  Bioware is still claiming that was in the writing of the end of a great story that spanned two Mass Effect games and was totally absent in the third one. Can Bioware fix the story, only if they can face the story and plot problems they created. But last I heard they just plan to explain the out of character bad ending just a little better, what ever that means. I am giving Mass Effect 3 a 6 score. I apologize to the artist's for the low score. I  apologize to the writers for the high score, twice what you deserved. I really hope the writers can redeem themselves for plot holes that you could drive a truck through. But only time will tell.",xminus

The Double Agent thing is a nice twist too, making you make game altering choices which hasn't been done in many games at all, let alone this series. The multiplayer is different than before..think more streamlined and quicker. And Youri, the story in this one is the major selling point this time, hence all the talk about the new direction the story was taking over all the other games. I suggest you get online like the other 4 million Livers and stop whining about 10 year old split screen. This game engine couldn't be doubled on the screen at the same time much like Doom 3 so I have no idea what you're complaining about. Split screen is all but history in this day and age of graphics engines that can barely run on the screen as it is, much less twice at the same time.",FPSMaster

This means that it can be hard to understand the narrator, so in retrospect it would have been better to turn the subtitles on so I could understand the narrator. I am not a great puzzle-solver, so it took me a long time to solve some of the puzzles, and one puzzle I had to read a walkthrough to solve. My overall playing time was 11 hours, which includes at least two hours spent stuck on a few puzzles. This is decent playing time for an indie title and a very good deal for what I paid for. I would say this game is excellent but falls a little short of my all-time favorite puzzle-platfrom game Vessel. Some of the puzzle solving involved a lot of trial and error in addition to pure deduction. It took me a while to figure out that the right button does not stop the game, it just slows it down a lot.

There aren't a lot of hints too in the games, and you'll need to experiment from time to time in order to progress. Again, initially it isn't a bad thing but sometimes you'd wish there were more help around. Example, at some point you have to take the eyes out of a creature in order to use them as balloons for your goo balls, yet there wasn't the slightest clue (or else I must be worryingly blind) that suggested you to do so, I just found it out of clicking fustration.

You have new agents to unlock, gear for them to look for and buy, as well as a hacking AI you can also upgrade, and which you need to bypass building security and other objects you find while on mission. The levels are randomly generated which gives you quite a lot of replay value. The actual stealth mechanic is very well implemented and it is possible to avoid detection to a remarkable degree, once you learn to trust it. The more invisible you manage to be the longer you can stay on a mission and the more loot you can collect. And sneaking around is great fun as we all know.All in all another highly polished title from Klei who once again get the gameplay just right, as they did with Mark of the Ninja. It is a bit on the short side, with the campaign ending after 72 hours; meaning that you will have to finish gearing up etc within ca. 6-8 missions, depending on travel times. The narration manages to be both sparse and slightly annoying by repeating itself every time you restart, which will probably be quite often if you play on the harder difficulties. This is the same problem of roguelike games vs narrative text that plagues Sunless Sea, although it`s not quite as bad here. A volume control for the narration voice might have been nice though.Other than these two slight criticisms Invisible Inc. is a great little title, and quite possibly the best (Or the only?) squad based tactical stealth game in existence.

However, there are few things that EA have done well. On Ultimate team for the first time released a new set of Ultimate Team Cards called Team of the Season cards from each league, this was very innovated for the time and best of all after one comes out and the next one comes out you can still get the TOTS players from the previous TOTS in packs, this made it easier for gamers to earn these players in packs. The shooting and passing seemed very choppy at first until I got us to the controls and now the shooting feels a little bit more accurate. There is no over powered free kicks and headers which is good because EA are trying to make the game a bit more realistic. Overall it's not a bad game, it has a few problems and the rest of the game modes, it is up to good standards. But if you're a fan of FIFA game, it is probably worth playing.",mileswhitmore

TL;DR version> Avoid this for now, some poor game design decisions have serious impact right now.More elaborate version: GW2 were always about non-grinding and going directly for the fun stuff. This expansion is the antithesis of this, as was already mentioned. Core mechanics are either character-exclusive or require tens of hours of grinding. Who says otherwise is lying, the only thing account bound in this expansion are masteries and you need 80+ hours of making a dent here.New locations are terrible by design. Too difficult for almost every solo player. That wouldn't be that bad if there were people around, but there aren't. You barely make any money on the map so when you finish it you move forward. As it is now most diehards already completed the map and it is now terribly empty, which means that almost no one can get those champion hero points you need for elite specialization that would make you stronger, which you need to be able to survive on this map. A loop of failed attempts of various kind is sure to follow.Another downside is that some game mechanics are still not as they should be. Anet tried to banish the holy trinity (DPS, tank, healer) but only achieved moderate success. DPS has its place, tanks have place too but healing characters are still ridiculously not worth the investment. It mattered little in original game but now when champions kill 30-40 people in a fight you really could use some healing. Sadly healing is as discouraged as ever, effectively shrinking the holy trinity to holy duo (tank, DPS).This expansion pack is difficult to assess right now because when there are hundreds of players on the new map it somehow works. When they leave for the rest of eternity it will be an empty, desolate place where no one will go because they won't have a chance at surviving. Diehards won't come back because there are no rewards and all of this will be for nothing.Many bad game design choices, and choices that go completely against the original intent of GW2. What made GW2 great is no more true in HoT.Also, I hope that Anet didn't spend too much money on paid meta critic reviews because this game moved from 3.8 to 6 in only a few hours.

As all my reviews with MMOâs start out the same as Iâve been playing MMO most all my life and they are my favorite type of game to play. As this review is being done on 9/7/2013 thatâs how Iâll be looking at the game as it stands now. Iâm still currently subscribed to FFXi and really have no plains of unsubscribing even with FFRR out now. Iâve been playing since the game was first released on PS2 and took a year or two off around 2005 because of a move. The game itself is really in a category of its own when it comes to MMOâs there is really nothing else quite like it out there. It still has a decent community and itâs one of the strong points of the game, people are extremely friendly and helpful. The game will defiantly require you to search the internet A LOT, this is a true adventure that will not hold your hand and tell you where to go. The game itself is much different then is was a few years ago due to game tweaks and changes done by SE in an attempt to appeal to a larger audience. However even with the leveling difficulty dialed back a little this is still a very hardcore mmo make no mistake about it. Game maps are just maps and donât have any kind of way point system even when doing quests or missions. Quest/mission logs are simple in comparison to todayâs MMO quest tracking. Combat is stats based, but I find the animations and combat very enjoyable. Graphically the game looks good for being over 10 years old now, but get the pc version itâs by far the best. Let me be honest Iâm very biased when it comes to this game; like I said before itâs the first MMO I really fell in love with. With that being said it defiantly will only appeal to a select audience due to the nature of the game. I find it very enjoyable and rewarding when I complete something in the game due to the high challenge of the game. Iâve also made some great friend through FFXI that I still play with today. In closing is a 10 out of 10 for me any day of the week and Iâll most likely hold a memorial service in itâs honor is SE ever shuts it down. My best advise to anyone joining is be social, ask questions any of the severs have a great hardcore friendly community willing to help new people out. If your not social this is not the game for you as missions and quest require parties.",Saber82

It is fair to say that Skyrim is a very good action RPG, but is rather too shallow to offer a truly great roleplaying experience.By doing away with the standard base statistics (strength, agility, personality, etc) in the name of simplification, Bethesda has actually cheapened the gamer's experience significantly.  Fallout: New Vegas offered a great insight as to how those statistics could affect the player's choices in a game, from different dialogue options with real consequences to being able to solve certain tasks for certain NPCs.  Without those differing routes to the same conversational goal, interactions with NPCs feel flat, bland and pointless.Of further frustration is that NPCs fail to recognise the player's achievements in the realm, though they comment freely on abilities of which they ought to know nothing.  ""Hands to yourself, sneak thief,"" a Whiterun guard might tell me, though I've never been spotted thieving in Whiterun (or anywhere near it).  I am, however, a thegn of Whiterun and, despite the Jarl's promise to let all and sundry know my new rank, I am never addressed as thegn by anyone save my huscarl (who, I am sure, does it only to humour me).  The addition of companions is tiresome in the sense that it adds nothing to the game, save a beast of burden.  Most are pretty poor combatants and the dungeoneer will find most of his time protecting the person whom he has hired to protect him.  Followers offer no unique interactions or personalised side quests and, in that respect, compare unfavourably with Fallout: New Vegas and the Mass Effect series.  They feel like an entirely wasted opportunity to add some roleplay value to the game.There are a large number of quests to complete, ranging from the benign (advise lovers for the Temple of Mara) to the downright evil (lure priests to their death for demented gods).  There are some real moral choices to be made.  However, there don't tend to be particularly profound consequences for those moral choices, which is rather disappointing.The raidiant quest system works well as a means of getting the player to explore the whole map.  While the radiant quests themselves are necessarily simplistic, that is entirely forgiveable in the circumstances.  Far more frustrating are the scripted side-quests, the College of Winterhold plot being  particular source of dissatisfaction at its short and shallow scope.  When I arrived, I was learning to cast ward spells.  Three hours later, I was the Archmage, thanks to an infuriatingly simplistic deus ex machina plot device, and without being a noticeably better spellcaster.  Morrowind required me to do tasks for various mages and to master several magical disciplines.  Winterhold obviously sets a lower premium on actually being any good at magic.    There are,  of course, things Skyrim does brilliantly.  It's a very handsome game to look at, even on medium graphics settings.  The dungeon design has improved immensely since Oblivion (even if the inevitable secret door back to the beginning seems like something of a cop-out).  The dual wielding system, while not perfect, is an interesting development and a welcome addition to the game.  Even in snowy Skryim, there are a variety of terrains and architectural styles which gave the game a real feeling of size.  The underlying plot dynamics are interesting: the Nords portray themselves as valiantly fighting for their homeland against the elven oppressors and the weak imperium, but themselves oppress Skyrim's native folk in the west.  But the game feels unfinished, even hasty in places and, after 80 hours play, leaves me with the distinct impression that it could have been so much more.",obscurus166
239366,Little Nightmares,XboxOne,9,"At first glance, Little Nightmares appears to be nothing more than a cutesy horror game aimed at the Nightmare Before Christmas crowd.

Part Tim Burton, part City of Lost Children, with some Silent Hill and Limbo mixed in for good measure, Little Nightmares puts its influences center stage and it works. Tarsier Studios managed to combine them into an impressive, yet small package that left me yearning for more.You begin the game as Six, a small, humanlike creature equipped with nothing but a bright yellow rain coat in a world that while not outright terrifying, you can tell from the minute you start, something is off. The entirety of the game is spent on a hulking ship only known as the Maw. What is it? Where is it going? Where did it come from? Why does almost everyone on the ship want to murder you? These questions are never answered, but I donât really care and neither should you. Much like Limbo, you are left alone with your wits, with very little direction for most of the game. While this may make it seem inaccessible, I only ran into issues when in an extremely dark area; I kept falling victim to cheap deaths caused by the game not telling me I had a lighter to make the pitch black area less deadly.The Maw is hands down the most detailed landscape Iâve seen in this gaming generation. The water and lighting effects are not only amazing, they are almost photorealistic. My one complaint about the visuals is that many of the areas are too dark. I not only had to turn the brightness all the way up, I had to adjust my TVâs brightness. This did lead to a few cheap deaths which were partly due to the lighter not being explained at the early stage of the game. The controls are fairly simple and very straightforward, but the addition of a tutorial may have made the beginning less frustrating.Tarsier put just as much love and attention into the sound effects. Long periods of silence will be broken up by torturous screams let out by unseen passengers, the creaking of the ship settling, and drips of leaky pipes. Again, nothing terrifying, but it just intensifies the feeling that something is waiting in the shadows to pop out and grab you at any moment.You will spend your time in the Maw evading a small number of enemies, most of which are the bosses of the game, many of which feature distorted features inspired by The City of Lost Children or Tim Burton. While like the setting, these are unsettling, they are not outright terrifying. These enemies will chase you multiple times throughout their designated level. These chases are a highlight of the game, although dark corridors leave little room for error; one misstep and you will have to begin the chase from scratch. While many levels will result in needing a few attempts, a perfect run gave me a sense of accomplishment that I havenât gotten from a game in a while. These will eventually lead up to a whopping two boss fights. These are the only two instances of any sort of combat you will experience, both of which are mind benders and do offer a change of pace from the puzzles and chases you encounter. The enemy with freakishly long arms will likely be the most frustrating confrontation of the year.The only other inhabitants of the Maw that do not try to kill you are small creatures reminiscent of a baby Pyramid Head from Silent Hill, which you can occasionally rescue or help in some way. These act as one of the collectibles of the game, which you must hug to claim. Doing so causes a tone ripped straight from Silent Hill, and shortly thereafter they disappear. Additionally, there are some other collectibles in the form of small pots that can be broken, and lamps or candles that can be lit. These do not add to the game in any obvious way aside from the associated achievements/trophies.Unfortunately, these collectibles are the extent of replayability, beyond those who wish to complete the games vague list of achievements/trophies. Little Nightmares does run a little short on content for the $19.99 price of admission, with my first playthrough clocking in at a little over 4 hours. My wife managed to complete the game in an hour less. Despite this shortcoming, I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of its influences or horror games in general. I would not be surprised to see Little Nightmares on many gamersâ Game of the Year list, including my own.",GBG_Jason

The graphics are amazing, probably the best i've seen in any game (except for maybe Dirt 2). There are some problems with Single Player, the enemy tend to focus on you a lot, there are some ""rush for cover"" parts that are annoying since they rely on just trial and error (such as avoid random mortar explosions, or avoid random aircraft falling from the sky - having to restart the scene countless times until you are lucky), and there are some parts where you need to fend off 100 enemies while the timer counts down (I really hate those kind of scenes), the high action can be very messy and tedious. Another problem is that your team mates just go on ahead of you and run into trouble. I would have preferred if you and your team were more professional and in control like as in Ghost Recon and you were the team leader, rather than be in a hectic rush all the time. Plus its a little too short (only 6-8 hours for a ""full"" price game is a waste of money, but it was given to me as a gift so I personally can't complain lol), but not quite as bad as some other games like Crysis for example.

76271,FreeSpace 2,PC,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Do you remember space sims? Back in the days when the PC ruled the gaming market and games would be laughed out of the game if they didn't have at least 30 key functions? No? Then you should buy Freespace 2, an action space sim released thirteen years ago. Despite the release date, the game has aged quite well, probably since there's very little to render on the screen: the massive explosions and hectic sound effects still hold up quite well. As for the game itself, you are a pilot in the GTVA and must help the alliance crush a seemingly routine rebellion; but as the game progresses, you soon learn that there is a darker side to this rebellion business than a simple xenophobic ideology. The missions are well-designed and the action is balanced by periods of silence & chaotic dogfights. The combat is immediately satisfying, with enemies who react fairly intelligently to your actions, even if they have a tendency to bump nose-first into gigantic warships. The warships themselves are much more significant  than the first Freespace, and will now attempt to brutally kill both you and other warships in a magnificent display of colour and action rarely seen in 90's games. So if you're in the mood for a good classic with varied mission design and a compelling, if character-less, narrative, get Freespace 2.",FFStudios

The threads fairly quickly begin to weave together though, into very satisfying second and third acts. The story isn't quite as epic as the first one, but I think a more personal story is actually the better choice here, rather than a ""save the world again"" rehash. My character went through moments of tragic loss, impossible moral dilemmas, and a shocking betrayal.

I've been playing racing games for 15 years and this is the first time I felt really frustrated at times because the AI would ruin the gameplay.Sometimes the drivatars will drive extremely aggressive and fast, they don't have to brake like you do so they get away with insane driving all over the road.There is also a major flaw in the AI when you raise the levels a bit where you can't catch the 1st and 2nd place car, on straight lines during the race they seem to install rocket boosters or something else because they speed up insanely fast.At one time I got extremely pissed because I tried everything in my abilities to catch up to the 1st car on multiple tries and it didn't work. On straight lines he would gain an insane lead on me. I got mad and bought the car he was using, and tuned it and still he was ahead of me on straights everytime.

After playing through the game though I can say I was wrong, I really liked all of the characters and actually started developing a connection for them. Overall the missions were pretty fun, yes it has some boring moments but Rockstar really did well creating a fun single player experience.Rockstar added a lot more depth to GTA V online mode in comparison to GTA IV. They basically took single player and turned it into a leveling/progression system. Level up and make money doing various jobs to unlock weapons/gear/customization/etc. As much as I do indeed like this, I would have liked to see another separate free mode that was just like GTA IV. Just to really goof around in from time to time.Overall it is indeed the game of the year, and a must buy for sure.",Whizzle

The characters are real, the experience is extremely emotional and the gameplay is perfect. Even with zombies, this is the most realistic game I have ever played. Everything that you do in the game, you could do in real life. They even based the disease that the zombies have, on a real life disease that exists in the insect world. The feeling that you could die at any second is always evident. This game is challenging, and those who pick a difficulty that they cannot handle will perish. It is very realistic in every way. You supplies are extremely limited and since you play as a 50 year old man through 90 percent of the game, you are at somewhat of a disadvantage at being a man of action. The hand to hand combat looks so real, as you put your full body into every punch. The game is lengthy, and the conclusion is so bad ass. Not to mention the absolutely great DLC Left Behind, that is free with the Remastered Edition. This is a game that even though it is linear, it never gets old. You can play it again and again forever, and you will never grow tired of it. It didn't win Game of the Year twice for nothing. Anyone who hates this game needs serious help. BUY IT!!!!!!

I have not played any of the other Witcher games so I went in having no real expectations.  So far the game is amazing.  I am having a blast.  What makes this game so great in my opinion is the attention to detail, combat, easy to control, and the skill tree system.  I wont go into the skill tree because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it really is pretty cool how CDPR incorporated the different skill sets and signs.  (signs are basically different kinds of magic spells).  The world is visually stunning, and massive.  Not to mention its jam packed with things to do and places to explore.  The reason I gave The Witcher 3 an 8 rather than a 10 is due to the somewhat choppy frame rate.  It isn't bad enough that it makes the game un-playable, but it can however make for some frustrating combat scenes.  Knowing CDPR this will be fixed with an update soon enough.  I also can not stand the swimming mechanics.  You will know what I mean when you try to loot a treasure chest that is under water.  Other than that and Geralt's super annoying voice the game is great. If you look at the negative reviews you will see very quickly that those users have no idea what they are talking about.  One guy gave the game a 5 because he didn't like how Geralt looks or sounds like. HAHAHA are you kidding me?  Says a lot about someone who doesn't like a game because of how a main male character looks.  Anyway the game is worth a try if you are a fan of RPGs.  The graphics are incredible for how massive and detailed the world is.  The combat system is easy to get used to.  Kind of reminds me a little of Shadow of Mordor, but not quite as good.  The sound is fantastic, and the level up system is fun and easy to use.

While there are still a number of tools available to help navigate through the maze of bad guys and other traps between you and your goal this change brings a whole new level of tension to the gameplay, no longer can you be certain of exactly where the enemies are.The jungle itself also provides for a far more interesting setting than the difficult to navigate oil rig from the series previous entry. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing but it also has a real impact upon gameplay with your level of camouflage vital to remaining hidden. It is also possible to capture and eat the wildlife in order to restore health with injuries now affecting Snake's ability to run and aim accurately.The games hand-to-hand fighting mechanics have also seen an overhaul with the introduction of the CQC system. This allows Snake to pull off a more complex set of combat moves and even tackle more than one enemy at once. Be warned however that getting spotted and outnumbered will still quickly get you killed!On the negative side there is still the odd camera issue to be found but the biggest problem, as with previous Metal Gear games, continues to be the quite frankly ludicrously long cut scenes (Some must exceed the half-hour mark!). If I wanted to watch a movie Iâd have put one in the disc tray instead of the game disc and it would be certainly make more sense.Other than this (rather important) issue however the Metal Gear Solid series continue to provide the best gameplay in its genre and Snake Eater is certainly worth adding to any collection.",drlowdon

Thankfully Assault Android Cactus can be included in these memorable experiences, and I would even go as far to say that this game is one the best twin-stick shooters Iâve ever played. The gameplay makes the game stand out in a big way and every little mechanic is flawless and very enjoyable, which is great. The amount of variety the game gives you is fantastic and the variety is especially shown in the weapons and enemies. Each weapon plays and feels different and the enemies are all unique and this in turn keeps things fresh and interesting throughout. If you like a challenge then this game will give you plenty of that. The boss battles are the epitome of challenging and theyâre something I really enjoyed, but I will say that some people might find the bosses a little too difficult. When it comes to replay value the game has plenty and without a doubt you will sink a lot of hours into the game because each different mode keeps you satisfied. One thing that surprised me about the game was the story. The story in the game is absolutely brilliant and the added humour is actually funny and it makes the many characters in the game to have a lot of charm and in the end you fall in love with them. The presentation side of the game is one of my favourite parts about the game because once again everything is flawless. Visually the art style is charming and fits the gameplay to perfection, and the accompanying soundtrack is great to listen to and the best thing is that it never gets on your nerves. At the end of the day to say that Assault Android Cactus gave me a huge amount of enjoyment would be a massive understatement because this game is without a doubt one of the best twin-stick shooters available. Itâs managed to get everything spot on and fans of this particular genre will love and become addicted to this game instantly. It goes without saying that this game gets a massive recommendation from me and I urge people to get the game immediately.",Xbox_Alive

It's not like once you enter a realm you can't leave (as some of the low reviews here might suggest), and you are ""forced"" to continue on. At any time you can take the souls you earned and return to the Nexus and spend them. The enemies DO respawn when you re-enter the realm, but you've spent your souls so it doesn't matter all that much. You always have the choice of pushing onward, risking the souls earned, vs. returning to cash them in. That's the beauty of the system. I suspect some of the low reviews here aren't used to any REAL risk in their current day gaming adventuring, and this comes as quite a shock. This game isn't for everyone, no doubt. But those looking for a real challenge that demands hard choices with actual consequences, this game is second to none.

260471,Slime-san: Superslime Edition,PlayStation4,9,"Since Super Meat Boy hit the scene, a series of difficult platformers with short levels have been released in the hopes of hitting the same levels of success. While Celeste has certainly reached that level, other games like Octahedron changed things up but didnât appeal to everyone, even though we enjoyed it. A developer canât blatantly rip off the base and expect the same kind of successSince Super Meat Boy hit the scene, a series of difficult platformers with short levels have been released in the hopes of hitting the same levels of success. While Celeste has certainly reached that level, other games like Octahedron changed things up but didnât appeal to everyone, even though we enjoyed it. A developer canât blatantly rip off the base and expect the same kind of success without adding their style to it, and that flare is where a game may live or die.Slime-san: Superslime Edition is what you loved about the original version of the game plus more. It has all the extras that you can unlock, the three campaigns, and several extra levels to bust your thumbs on. Quite honestly, the amount of content in this game is staggering. The levels themselves offer a decent amount of replay value with speed runs, extra challenge items, and secret areas. You can use the items from the secret areas (coins) and levels (apples) to purchase extra content, such as arcades and game filters, respectively. The arcade games are actually mini-games like kart racing, all of which stand out being a completely different look from the game you were just playing. These extras serve as an incentive to collect the apples and coins when you can, or at least gives players a reason to go back to the levels later on in the hopes of getting everything.Just because a game has a lot doesnât mean that itâs all good. Luckily, it appears that is the case here. Whether youâre traveling through the giant worm, kraken, or facing Sheeple in his new appointed role of villain, everything plays well and is fun to take on. At the end of a series of levels youâll be faced with a boss, which doesnât involve too much out of the ordinary on your end, but it is fun to see how they incorporate all the skills youâd normally use to pass through a level against a large foe.As this is a game that focuses heavily on twitch gameplay (not the streaming service, although it would make for a good game on the platform), itâs important that the controls are tight and responsive. Any lag can mean death and unending frustration, and Iâm happy to say the main disappointment youâll face here is your own lack of ability. In addition to the obvious moving around, jumping, and wall jumping, youâll have the ability to dash and phase through green objects that would otherwise be solid. That all sounds pretty basic, but itâs when you see how the abilities interact with the levels that things really start to get interesting. When you take into account that the phase ability also slows down everything including yourself, it allows for some pinpoint action â or will result in an untimely death.If you think youâll have the ability to spend time on each level, think again. After a short period the level will begin to fill up with stomach acid. In some levels, this is necessary for progression as itâll change the make-up of the level. In most itâll merely serve as a timer forcing you to hurry through the level. The only time this will really cause any issues is for some of the apples youâll be collecting. While there seems to be a lot of variation in the levels in what youâre asked to do, the tasks can become repetitive. While SMB has distinctive levels one after another, youâll start to see double while playing Slime-san. One thing that will stand out amongst the repitition is the soundtrack, which is absolutely stellar. Make sure you have the volume up for this one.Itâs no wonder that Slime-san is getting a new edition after spending some time with it. Thereâs so much to love about it, and while it does have a few flaws, the positives far outweigh the negatives it has. If youâre big into platformers and missed this the first time around, I implore you to get slimy with the Super Slime Edition.",GBG_Jason

(I just love exploiting games, but it is an indication of poor quality control.) The general fun I have playing, the compelling story, and overall replayability make the flaws it has easy for me to overlook. This is a GREAT addition to the Elder Scrolls franchise as well as to the corpus of RPG games.-----------Detailed review:The Bad:1. Attributes and other boosts aren't checked/capped. There is no upper limit one can boost these to with potions. The number will also suddenly flip to a largely negative value. This is near inexplicable behavior if you don't know the innards of a computer (I do). If you love exploiting things look at the next item for why this is bad even if you don't cross that magical negative flipping boundary.2. Some temporary boost potions can kill you when they wear off, if you have boosted yourself more than 2x your HP, and have taken more than 1x your HP in damage that's unhealed. I experienced this with 30seconds of a quick save and 6 hours of the prior regular save. I eventually survived...3. Buggy on release. Many of these bugs persist, long after the game is no longer being maintained. Too many mods are needed to fix all of the bugs, bogging down the machine running it, doubly true for the hardware of 2002.The Mediocre (Not bad, not great):1. Melee combat. It's serviceable, but rough.2. Spell crafting. I like crafting spells, but the UI is merely serviceable, even by 2002 standards.3. Side quests are a mixed bag for writing and presentation.4. In game books -- like real life books the quality of the writing in these is all over the place. The reasons to read them are three fold: a) skill increases (very rare), b) increase player knowledge of the game realm that is Elder Scrolls, c) you actually like the book(s). (some people do!) The reason to carry them in inventory is for gold. Skill books command a good price.5. You can talk to almost everyone! But not everyone has something valuable or interesting to say. Those with little value to say pretty much share the same dialogue tree.6. The DLC was a mixed bag in my view. For me, the stories for those felt forced at times, with the exception of Bloodmoon.7. The graphics were mediocre for 2002. They've not aged as well as one might have hoped. But I still enjoy the game a lot, despite this.The great:1. Well thought out main story with great writing. I felt motivated to figure out if my character was actually the Nerevarine. This was a very enjoyable experience for me.2. The RPG mechanical elements, such as skills, attributes and the like are well thought out, tho not perfectly balanced. These allow for a lot of replayability while having to master new gameplay mechanics each time.3. In game tutorial woven through as part of the game at the start. This is a huge bonus as it ensures you know the basics of how to play and manage your character.4. Magic is well done in this game and the variety of schools to master is a detail I find highly enjoyable. While spell crafting can be tough for the faint of heart, you have no absolute need for it. You can buy good spells in every Mages Guild.5. Factions/Guilds have separate agenda's and their own involved quest lines that can rarely come into conflict with each other. While not as thoroughly polished as the main quest, these are still intriguing and fun to play, especially when you must choose to never complete a quest or to get ejected from a guild. If you don't like such tough choices, don't join any guilds.6. The volume of side quests, while fulfilling the main archetypes for quests, is just astounding. You have to play for a very very long time to find, and complete them all.7. The world map is HUGE. It's open, more open than even its descendants, and is very detailed for its time.  The types of landscapes you'll encounter are varied, and with no loading screen for moving from the swampy areas to the desert and then to the ash-blown wastes that is the volcanic center of the island-nation of Morrowind. But be warned if you try that, you will be doing a lot of walking. Mage Guild Teleportation, or Silt Striders are your best fast travel options.8. You can keep playing after the main quest is done! Yay!In conclusion 8/10: This is a GREAT addition to the Elder Scrolls franchise as well as to the corpus of RPG games. I find this an immensely replayable, fun, well written game with a larger than desirable share of non-game-breaking bugs. If it had better QC it would have gotten a 9 or 10 from me.

I didn't even know they existed to begin with. Since I just finished the single player campaign, I feel ready to write this review. Why? Because honestly, the single player campaign was awesome. Ridiculously varied from the first game and insanely brilliant puzzles. A lot of people are complaining about the ""Please don't turn off your console"" dialogue that shows up when you are saving. I don't understand how people can be so immature about this. The entire game feels just as PC tailored as the previous game, and any other fantastic Valve creation. If that little line of dialogue is enough to piss you off, boy you sure haven't played the other PC to console games yet. And rest assured, there is NO cliffhanger ending for Portal 2; everything wraps up perfectly, as you will experience. Honestly, you would be doing yourself an incredible injustice to yourself to dismiss this game on such trivial grounds. One thing that is true however is that the campaign is short. I finished it in 3.9 hours according to Steam (though it's strange because I started at 10:30 pm and ended at 6:00). However, just like with CoD4, this campaign is intensely satisfying, and making it longer would have definitely killed the fun. Personally Portal 2 would have been well worth $60 (I got the PS3 version for $55 with $20 Amazon credit and played the Steam version) but that's just me. Regardless of how much you are willing to pay for it, I definitely recommend that you eventually play this game if you loved the first one like I did.

This game is not Halo 3, but it is another opportunity to once again step into the shoes of Master Chief. If that's what you're looking for, you've found it. If you're looking for the epic space opera you remember, I've got bad news. When Master Chief's last words in Halo 3 were ""Wake me when you need me"", he wasn't talking to Microsoft's marketing department. The image of Master Chief, at peace floating somewhere out there in space had found its place in our minds for the last 5 years. It was a beautiful image. Unfortunately, Microsoft is willing to disturb that to make a quick but very large buck. Halo 4 is not a bad game, but it can't escape the air that it is a product more than a work of art as its predecessors were. I want to call it uninspired, but that is too narrow a definition of inspiration. A cattle prod can be inspiring if you happen to be cattle and so can a multi-billion dollar company breathing down your neck when you are a video game developer. ""This game needs drama"" says Microsoft; 343 adds a commander who's only character trait is getting pissed off. ""This game needs conflict""; so fabricates an entirely new villain with motives no more complicated than ""destroy all humans"". Most elements of the story seem to have been thought up in this manner, right down to the whole ""Cortana is dying"" subplot, I assume the though process to this was ""This story needs to engage the player emotionally"" ""Alright, lets threaten to kill off a character established by much more skilled writers"". This is the only aspect of the story that really connects with you and it only works because they glom off character development done by Bungie for the better part of a decade. As for the multiplayer; it's still Halo, but they seem to have spilled some ""Call of Duty"" on it. If you like either of those games you'll have fun. This may be were you find your entertainment if the story falls short. This is Halo 4's redeeming quality; it's an all you can eat buffet. You don't like the story? Try war games. Bad at war games?

Despite its many flaws, the epic world-building, beautiful art direction, and surprisingly deep story told in an story-book fashion (which drove away some people due to its simplicity) made the game worthwhile even through its repetitive segments. Unfortunately, Delta does not remedy the critical flaw of repetition, it adds so many improvements that it is worth the new purchase for Soul Sacrifice fans, and a must-buy for newcomers seeking fast-paced action. It is an expansion, yes, but one that improves the game at a fundamental level.Soul Sacrifice Delta is the definitive version of Soul Sacrifice which addresses many issues players had with the first game. Weapon balancing, quick weapon summoning, spell combos, and heavier consequences for black rites are some of the many changes seen in this iteration.The repertoire of spells have been revamped and although there are still useless fodder ones scattered about, the balancing and the sheer number of old and new spells make it possible to achieve variety in builds.Main story line is largely unchanged, and all of the content from the first game is retained, though with minor graphical improvements. Of course, Soul Sacrifice suffers from the common flaw inherent in the hunting genre: repetition. This is slightly mitigated this time around because the spell rewards are diverse, but newcomers to the genre may be deterred, understandably.The amount of new story content is merely an expansion that has a small impact on the main story line, but it does an adequate job of expanding the universe of Soul Sacrifice. World-building was already very well done in the first game, and Delta adds new dimensions to the story. Again, these changes are basically inconsequential to the main story line, and therefore it is slightly disappointing.Is it worth buying?The $35.99 USD/CAD price tag for those who've played the game already is steep, but well worth it if you loved the first game. Soul Sacrifice Delta is an extremely polished version of the first game with plenty of new content, but it is completely reasonable for veterans to be driven away by being asked to pay full price for what is essentially an expansion, albeit a very large one.Those who've never played the game or were not interested the first time around should give Delta a chance. Despite not being perfect in any means, it is very near the apex of what the Soul Sacrifice experience that the first game sought to achieve.",guy102931

All the more surprising that this year EA did not even bother to add any new leagues to its game. There is still no Greek league (14th strongest in Europe), Czech league (13th strongest) and even no Ukrainian league (7th (!) strongest), whose Shakhtar Donetsk play in the Champions League knockout phase almost every year. As for national teams, Chinese and Canadian national teams were added, while the national team of South Korea has been removed for some reason. EA is a huge corporation with an annual net income of almost billion of dollars and why they would not spend a few dollars on licensing to add at least three more major European leagues to its game is just beyond me. Just this example of stinginess from EA is enough to decrease the final score of the game by five points.As for gameplay, it is repulsive, nauseating and simply depressing for a game of 2015. I do not play the Ultimate Team, although it is the most popular mode in FIFA, because I do not wish to give any more of my money to EA other than 59.99 plus sales tax for the game itself (which is too much already). I play mostly career mode on World Class difficulty. No matter what you do, you have a constant feeling that a result of a match does not depend on your actions and your skills. Even teams from the Football League Second Division maintain ball possession like they are FC Barcelona, they very rarely make passing mistakes, and its players score some incredible one-touch volleys from a distance of 35 meters. Your players, however, cannot even dream of scoring from such distances ever, they have better chances to send a ball to the Moon than to a back of the net. Also, you are lucky if your through-ball passes go to a player you intend them to go 50% of the time and even luckier if they indeed reach your target 20% of the time. AI players of your team almost never do what every normal football player with a brain would do in a specific situation. For example, my teammates never, not a single time, in all the matches I played opened up for a ground cross. Skill moves and tricks are a disaster, as four times out of five your player does something completely different from what you intended to do. And I can come up with dozens of situations like this. Particular attention deserve those moments when your team is losing on the 81st minute of the game, a rival player goes with the ball to a corner flag, and you spend eight minutes trying to take it from him. Moments like this show better than anything what a failure FIFA 16 is. It is as frustrating as it can get in a sports game.I must admit that graphics indeed are amazing, and it is the only thing that keeps improving from year to year. But, as you perfectly know, not a single person buys a sports game for its graphics. For graphics, people watch the real-world football matches.Music is an absolute nightmare as it has been in all FIFA editions since 2002 (can't assess earlier versions as I have not played them). Why nobody in EA Sports even thought of putting some classic rock, or jazz, or some kind of music back from the days when you still could listen to it without your ears bleeding. Every year I just go to settings and turn off all the so-called songs that there are. I think at least in one PC edition of FIFA, you could create your own soundtrack list, but, unfortunately, this idea, as most of the good ideas in EA, it did not live on.In conclusion, after three weeks of suffering, I returned the game to GameStop. My score for graphics is 9, for league licensing 4, for gameplay 2, and for music 0. Overall, my score is 3 out of 10. FIFA 16 is another great example of why EA is a video game company with the worst reputation of them all.",Faraday2015

With Doom, you still just run around looking for ammo, using your flashlight and shooting up stuff. Occasionally, you have to read other people's e-mail to get codes to open up their lock boxes to get, guess what, ammo, health, and body shields. It's an amusement park ride, pure and simple.

It was and still is one of the most popular PC games of this decade. Creative mode is where you are invincible, and are free to create anything you desire, along with your unlimited resources. However survival mode is the mode that most players will either love or hate. To be fair, Minecraft's unique game design does have a certain charm to it. It's simplistic designs and controls allow for gamers of all levels to be able to approach it easily. Despite, this, Minecraft does feel bare at times, and for an open-world survival game, many of the game elements such as combat and enemies do get tiring fast. Minecraft is an entertaining game, easy to jump into at any time, but the experience that it offers isn't quite as revolutionary that many make it out to be.",ashketchum

Im reviewing the game Bethesda made, not community.I will not comment about graphics, that was never part of fallout and I dont mind 64x64px texture being used on bobby pin as well as 5x10m big billboard although it does make your eyes hurt.Lack of skills is surprise. If you dont have certain perk, you wont even have chance to try to pick a lock. Game simply doesnt allow you to use it.  I'd love to hear Todd Howards speech how less RPG elements actually enhance RPG genere ;)SPECIAL is plain pointless and it only affects your hitpoints, action points and carry capacity. Charisma and intelligence are dump stats. Yes, intelligence 1 lets you use same dialogue options and hack computers like a pro. So much for Fallout 1, 2 where intelligence 1 made you a total retard and you couldnt even talk to intelligent people. You simply didnt understand what they are saying. No such cases here in F4.Conversations are limited to 4 dialogue options. I liked voice narration, however some players who are role playing might not like it. It makes you feel less connected with hero. Feels like you are just observing someone, doesnt make you feel its you.I couldnt help myslef but for the whole time, I had immersion Im playing idSofts RAGE.Whie its good the shooting mechanics is better, they fixed combat but completely ignored RPG part of the game. Fallout 4 is as much RPG as Borderlands is. You have generic character pretty much 40% of players will have and you chose perks from simple tree. Its a first/3rd person action shooter. I wouldnt be surprised if there was autoheal.You can choose to be good or bad. Thats about it. In both cases, you are supposed to kill everything you meet. Conversations, barter, sneak, etc simply wont allow you to progress without killing everything.For more violent players, it also doesnt feel like RPG. You can use every weapon you pick, no more specialization in energy weapons or conventional firearms. This also implies the feel its a shooter. Whatever gun you find, you can use it. Weapon quality degradation is out, no more hunting for spare parts to fix them.I didnt bother with the Minecraft or Tower defense part of the game, as I simply think its completely out of topic and has no placein RPG games. Imagine having solitaire minigame in Need for Speed for instance ;)All in all, Fallout 4 is mediocre first person shooter in open world with inventory. RPG wise its disaster.F1 and F2 fans will absolutely hate it. F3 fans will not like it for even more dunped down RPG elements. (unless they played F3 as shooter as well.)Call of Duty and Doom fans will feel right at home though.",BuGi

187737,Dragon Age: Inquisition,PC,8,"I'm loving the game, but I'm starting with the bad because it's easier to complain than it is to compliment:Combat mechanics have never been Bioware's strong point, and I've continued enjoying their games in spite of that since Baldur's Gate, but it's worse than usual here. Thankfully, after a few hours, I became comfortable enough with the controls that it never became a deal-breaker.I'm loving the game, but I'm starting with the bad because it's easier to complain than it is to compliment:Combat mechanics have never been Bioware's strong point, and I've continued enjoying their games in spite of that since Baldur's Gate, but it's worse than usual here. Thankfully, after a few hours, I became comfortable enough with the controls that it never became a deal-breaker.The controls are bad. The left-click to swing mechanic is a bizarre design decision that impacts your ability to control your character throughout the rest of the game. Being limited to eight abilities sucks; after a certain point, advancing my character starts to feel like wasted effort, because I can't actually use any of my new abilities without giving up the ones I've already earned. Animation-locks on attacks and abilities are painfully long which, combined with the character turning and accelerating slowly, makes me feel like I'm never truly in control of my character.The tactical camera is nearly useless. I use it to make my party avoid dragons' fireballs, and that's it; any more interaction than that is just begging for frustration.One of the pre-release reviews I read said Bioware had ""hilariously overcorrected"" for the small and reused areas in Dragon Age 2. This is pinpoint-accurate. Dragon Age 2 had a small footprint, but the quest content in that footprint was actually very well-focused and well-executed. DAI made their areas massive, and then tried to stuff the same area:content ratio into that space. They bit off way more than they could chew. The vast majority of things to do in DAI are MMO-style throwaway fetch/gather quests. It's like they used SWTOR as a model for sidequest building instead of a cautionary tale. I had a huge disappointment last night with a massive quest that had me running back and forth across an entire (huge) desert for hours, and I found nothing but an empty room with a chest of loot as my payoff.Attention Bioware: quality over quantity next time. The best sidequest I can think of would have been the weakest sidequest in DA2.I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to make my character walk instead of run. Turns out it's not possible, which is baffling.Those are the negative things I have to say. In spite of those complaints, I'm enjoying the game immensely.Companion interactions are the best they've ever been. I absolutely love all of the new characters (save one whose entire personality consists of being completely poised at all times and calling me ""dear"" a lot). Seeing the way characters from DAO and DA2 have developed, and helping them along in that development, is incredibly gratifying. If you enjoy going back to camp, the Normandy, or the Hanged Man to talk to your companions, you'll love it in DAI.I like the crafting system a lot. The level of customization in both appearance and stats is surprisingly good. Finding recipes has been a challenge, which is either good or bad depending on the type of player you are.The world is gorgeous. The graphical quality itself is solid, but the attention to detail is excellent. I have lots of peeves with the little details in every game I play, but none of them are present here. Except the hair. The hair sucks. The areas themselves are big and beautiful. Each companion having distinct styles for their various sets of armor was a great touch.In spite of the MMO-style sidequests, the main storyline is fantastic, and all the companion quests have been good. There are big, tough choices, several of which I can't wait to explore the other side(s) of.This game is far from perfect, but it easily comes out on top. Some of the problems will hopefully be solved by patches and mods. The biggest problem is the handling of sidequests. If you can suppress your completionist streak long enough to avoid completing every single quest you run across, you'll have fun.Good game. Easily worth buying, even if I wish they'd done some things differently.",LlamaHerder

It delivers an amazingly huge world, full of different planets, alien races, technology, and locations. Everything in the game has a background to it, creating an extremely rich and immersive world. Another thing I really loved about Mass Effect was how well the personalities of characters were developed, especially your party members. Of the 6 available party members, I ended up using them all at some stage. There were never any benchwarmer characters as is common with many party-oriented RPGs. I haven't even gotten to the gameplay yet. The RPG elements are superb. You get to choose between 6 different character classes, and even within each class there are many skills and abilities which you can learn in whichever order you want. When interacting with the NPCs, you get to choose every single line that your character says. That is how much variation there is in the game's dialogue. And the things you say greatly affect how other characters feel about you. There is a lot of freedom in the game, in a sense that you can roam about the entire galaxy and do sidequests as you see fit. Even most of the primary quests you can do in any order you wish. There were of course a few things I could nitpick. For example the control of Mako (the tank) was a bit frustrating at times, but any flaws are very minor and do not detract from the amazing experience that this game offers. Now I am going to play Mass Effect 2, and according to what I hear, it is even better. If that's the case, I am prepared to have my mind blown away.",Matseb2611

And the stupid said ""We repeat the Warden 5x Eternal"" and how is not enough, let's close the game with his presence again. The game became boring, annoying repetitive with this opponent.2 - Whose idea was it to by Cortana against humans? It will be ridiculous if you evoke the Mendicant Bias or Flood to justify the support of cortana human again.3 - Cade chief? Where you stuck the Chief? Not evoke the Halo Reach to explain that Halo survive without the Chief because that work was exceptional to explain the gaps, with a colossal story to be explored, you decided to opt for a story where the Chief is not the protagonist, Chief was turned into a mere representative of his own existence, and not the face itself.4 Again, where is the Chief?5 - Please kill the Spartan Lock character in some comic book launched between any before the release of Halo 6, or cause him to die in some Roard Star, send it to look for a Criptum any forgotten. Nothing against the actor, all against Spartan Lock.6 - I have to say, the musical work is flawless, perfect.7 - Graphics great, but again I do not want Graphics want a solid history with the Master Chief.Summary: Disappointed.Sorry mistakes, English is not my native language.I play all Halo.

Overall I give it a buy, but to an Assassin's Creed fan like me it may disappoint you. One last note - I don't think they should be releasing a title every year.

This is the best Zombies experience there is, on par with and built over the original experience in World at War. Diverse maps, great gameplay, complex mechanics that actually require some forethought, and an interesting wrap up to the background storyline to boot. +2 for impressing me on this part of the game, and -1 for deliberately putting the best parts of BO3 in $60 DLC.The multiplayer gameplay itself is surprisingly good too, but the unreliability of the servers effectively cancel this out. The specialists and movement system keep things varied enough, and the new game modes like Safeguard are more than welcome. Relatively balanced gunplay. All in all it's still fun with a friend, and that's also the only reason I play it, if only to pass the time waiting to find a real match.And yes, -2 for being another COD game. Starting at an 8/10 is more than fair. We all know the series has been milked, but compared to the immediate previous games in this series, BO3 is definitely a standout title. I'd even say that I'd rather play this than MW3 or BO2, and I'd rank BO3 above either of them.",KingAndCountry

172912,Tomb Raider,Xbox360,10,"Tomb Raider is a standalone classic within itself.

Fans of the series may find themselves feeling strange with the more action adventure oriented game play, which is done in a more conventional style similar to Farcry 3 (Â©2013, Ubisoft)- in fact, parallels can be made with the game play regarding the environment interactivity, such as hunting  and the RPG system of gaining experience for kills, relevant storyline actions, hidden loot and relics, however; with a system of beneficial crates and extra missions that are enjoyable and worthwhile stashed throughout the island, players are given a heightened incentive to explore. In fact, an additional similarity with Farcry 3 can be drawn to the overall premise. Where the game shines is within its production values, overall fluidity of controls, as well as a solid plot and stellar voice actors. One more distinct aspect of game play that can also be said to have been done prior is from Hitman: Absolution (2013,  Square Enix), in which a heightened awareness can be activated, however unlike in the aforementioned title and for the benefit of Tomb Raider, this device is implemented to effectively encourage exploration and attention to detail to the environment, as objects such as plants, animals and crates appear highlighted on the screen. There is an interesting amount of realism to the game and this is in concerns to the direct characterization of the protagonist and the potential enmeshment for the gamer, made all the more great by a strong hook and a very gritty unveiling of the creation of what is, for all intents and purposes, a strong-willed woman who is malleable and apt to adapt to survive. It is refreshing to find a game in a male dominated market that offers such, as most women in games are portrayed as timid or in need of protection. On this note it should be mentioned that some gamers may be turned off by the role, perhaps because of the novelty and difference, although if preconception and doubts can be set aside, the treasure is plentiful.The adventure itself is fresh, given a presentation that is surprisingly macabre- with the graphics having a very desaturated tone to them, highlighting shadows and using an all around dark pallet, these constituents create a dim mood, almost somber or melancholy. It is this, over and above all the ingredients above that make for a classic within the genre, in note as the most stellar entry in the series. Issues with the game that some players may find could be that of its linearity, although the game is neither dull nor repetitive, with the tasks at hand providing an interaction that makes the player not only want to focus but be drawn into the smooth surroundings by tight controls and realistic physics. In addition, reply value is somewhat questionable, although many games similar that are heavily focused on narrative and eventual development fit with tutorials may leave the gamer with little desire to replay the title immediately. Regardless, this game is a definitive must have,  with everything so ideally polished and honed that Tomb Raider is hard to put down for any gamer who enjoys adventure, exploration, a firm plot, and action. Even if not to necessarily a game to be played within the years to come, without doubt it will stand the test of time and is a must have for fans to put on the shelf.Score 10/10",m3xc

I have loved FIFA every year, but this year they have changed a lot in terms of game play. Players feel clunky and hard to maneuver, defense is made a lot harder to control than in previous years, AI is an utter tragedy as well as mostly unresponsive and unhelpful, and shooting is still ridiculously unlogical (even though it was a lot worse on first release but changed with update). The two main criticisms of the ones I named above are AI and shooting. Regarding AI, I understand that most of the game play should be controlled by the user, but in some situations  the AI should compensate for minimal errors carried out in the flow of game play. Some of the situations I have noticed are such that a pass that is maybe half a foot off target may often make it is as if the player completely ignores the pass altogether as if he isn't apart of the play or another situation such as an attacking player has beaten a user controlled defender but runs directly into the path of an AI controlled defender and this defender does nothing to stop the attacker. Shooting is the other criticism that is unrealistic at times. Players should not be able to do a complete 180 and be able to get perfect contact every time or be able to pull off unrealistic wonder shots from ridiculous angles with pressure on them. The only reason I am  giving this game a 3 instead of a 0 is because all of the available game modes, graphics, and overall presentation of the game are just as great if not better than any other FIFA in the past. If it says anything, I have played FIFA for about 10 years and this is the first time I have wanted to stop playing or looked into playing PES as an alternate to FIFA.",DMein

They effectively act as continues, rezzing you automatically at the spot you died in the midst of the battle. It's really satisfying to find an extra potion as they are quite rare!The move-cancellation system is a real treat! At any time you can press down to cancel whatever you are doing. This can be to cancel out of a longer attack animation, or to recover after being hit. This also has the effect of hammering you towards the ground post haste, so can even be used to move around the levels quickly.Also once you hit the ground (or if you were already on the ground), you can immediately press left/right to dash in said direction! This is often used to get behind enemies that block from the front, or that are telegraphing overpowered attacks.Even when running from A to B, a quick 'down, forward' on the D-pad will give you a burst of speed to make the slight hesitation of pressing down worthwhile!The cancellation is on a 2 second timer so can't be abused after every single attack animation, but you can find/craft more charges, and learn skills that reset the charges.As you play the game you begin to transfer the cancel/dash and other moves to your muscle memory (the timed platforming sections are great for this, as while they start off easy enough, they soon become really challenging and require as many dashes and wall jumps as humanly possible).Once you are performing these technical moves on the battlefield, you feel like such a badass, dashing, dodging, countering, wall jumping, building combos and triggering assists from your 'party' (think of any recent fighting game that allows you to tag in a backup character for a second), or going all out in focus mode!There is no dodge rating or block percentage in this game; all skills must be performed by the player and timed perfectly for maximum results. Grinding can help to soften the edges of boss battles, but it's still on you to play well, especially once the timed platforming sections go from optional to compulsory, later in the game!All in all, Valdis Story is a great action platformer in the style of Metroidvania, and is the most fun I've had with a game since I replayed Castlevania: Symphony of the Night on PS1 (earlier this morning).",Mr_Steam

The maps have been expanded a decent bit, there are very cool customization options that help you give a personal touch to virtually every bit of gear right down to the totally unimportant player cards. Graphics are really good but only due to the excellent art design, if you start looking you will find signs of serious graphical fidelity the engine has experienced over the years. Sounds are also a definite improvement over previous cods as well as animation, all together these help to make the campaign quite memorable, no matter how confusing it gets at times. One downside of the multiple characters thing is that  you don't leave hating the antagonists enough, otherwise as a whole it is quite varied and fast paced with some welcomed breaks in between stages. Camp-fests are virtually none-existent now and the killstreak rewards aren't particularly overused and OP either, leaving much of the fighting in infantry CQC form. Unfortunately Treyarch has yet to nerf the two most OP guns in the game (roughly a year after release o.O), which has put me off for a bit due to recent overuse by the community. The MP as a whole I prefer outright over MW2, and it's minor issues are overshadowed by this fact.",shaun37

FORZA 4 exceeds all my wildest expectations for this franchise and I am having a blast playing it. The graphics are top notch even with this current generations hardware becoming a little long in the tooth. The sound is incredible and the car selection has a nice mix of European, American, Japanese, Etc. I also love the added bonus of running through some of the TOP GEAR challenges as that show has become, very recently, one of my favorites.

I found myself falling in love with the story again. This is a well-deserving remake that was handled with great care by Nintendo, and I can really appreciate that. Technically, someone could say that it's the same game. It is. But upgraded with crisp sounds that make you hum along to every recognizable track, beautiful graphics that still somehow can capture the essence of it's predecessor. And the use of the 3D is done flawlessly. For example, quite a few titles on the 3DS use the gyroscope feature in a way that is clunky and aggravating to use. Here, however, the choice is a. optional, b. very receptive, and c. doesn't get in the way of the gameplay at all. The use of the 3D is wonderfully implemented and adds a great sense of depth to the game. Some welcome changes are added here too that make the game run much more smoothly, such as the touch screen being the inventory screen. The Water Temple was made more tolerable - still an agony, but the use of the iron boots and cutscene clues further prevent any glitches. The Master Quest is here for replayability value, and that rocks. What it comes down to is that this is one oft he best ports ever made, to a handheld alone, and feels like this was what the developers wanted the game to look/feel like when it came out.

Shoot theAlright, let's look at this as a game on it's own, and not as part of a series. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's single player campaign plays like a movie, with little emphasis on exploration or tackling objectives in your own fashion. Behind all of the explosions and mayhem is a glorified set of corridors in which you do exactly as you're told, or else you cannot progress. Shoot the helicopter with this conveniently placed RPG, jump here, bomb these red squares here, follow this guy, and so forth. One part of the game attempted to make me feel something, but it didn't. Anyone else who played through the campaign knows what I'm talking about (it involves a van). The gunplay in the singleplayer seems to be a lot like whack a mole, with you trying to shoot the bad guys before they pop into cover, without much variation.For a lot of people, the main meat of the game is in it's multiplayer. This mode contains your standard modes of play such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, and so on. You get perks, which are like attributes that improve your abilities in certain areas, like sleight of hand which makes you reload faster. You also get certain ""streaks"" which are rewards for doing well. An example would be killing three people in a row and receiving a ""UAV"", and this UAV grants you the ability to check a minimap for the location of your foes. You can also get ""streaks"" for doing various teamwork related actions.A third mode is the ""Spec Ops"" mode where you can attempt a few challenges either alone or with one friend. There is survival mode within this mode, where you fight wave after wave of enemies for as long as you can, while being able to buy upgrades and other weapons between and during waves to heighten your chances of survival. It's basically like the game Killing Floor with some more running. The other chunk of spec ops is a bunch of varied challenges, like ""kill these targets within a certain time to receive stars"" or  ""collect these samples"". The stars you receive allow you to unlock more challenges, and playing the challenges on higher difficulties rewards you with even more stars.Now, I can't give this game two ratings, but I'd like to. If this is your first time playing a game in the Call of Duty series, I'd give it an 8. If you have played games in this series before, 6, because it is very similar to the earlier ones.",Iobham

And let me tell you when I say this game is an outstanding success in every way. My personal experiences with GTA games haven't gone great, I've always felt that the majority of them were clunky pieces of design which were often over rated and irritating to play. But with GTA V, they've completely flattened out any issues with the other games I had and generally improved it in other things. We're not just talking about one of the best games ever, what we're experiencing here is one of the most amazing feats of interactive entertainment in the modern era. Nothing I've played video game wise, watched film wise or interacted with entertainment wise, has had me more involved or entertained then what this game did. Of course there are times where it's a bit crazy and it pushed the boat a bit far, but this game ISN'T designed for kids it really is that simple.

If you get it solely for single player you'll regret your decision. With that being said, BF3's multiplayer is in a class of its own, and while the PS3 version cannot hold a candle to its PC brethren graphically, it is still a quite solid game visually. Audio is superb. Having a grenade explode right next to you with surround sound turned on and the bass pumped up is nothing short of audiophilic bliss. With four game modes(Rush, conquest, squad rush, squad deathmatch) and huge maps/vehicles, the multiplayer portion of this game is such a breath of fresh air when compared to COD's archaic deathmatch types. Jets flying overhead, tank shells exploding and tearing holes in buildings as you run by them to get to the next capture point is quite simply gaming nirvana in my opinion, and well worth the price of admission alone. Partying up is easier than was in the beta, though playing co-op should be done with friends only to avoid being kicked from the game when the other person decides they have something more important to do. As far as the single player campagin goes, well, it's not great by any stretch of the imagination, but there are a few points during the campaign that really show off the Frostbite 2 engine, but other than that everything's pretty by the books. With the release of Back to Karkand slated for release in a month or so I'm quite happy with my purchase, and expect many more hours of muliplayer fun in the months to come.

New Vegas was rushed to market before it was ready much like Fallout 3. Wait for the bargain bin on this one.Positives: Obsidian does a MUCH better job of writing story lines and quests than Bethesda did. Good voice acting. New environment and (slight) movement forward in terms of the Fallout canon. Negatives: Its still Oblivion (LOLblivion) with guns. As others have posted, you think they would've improved the game engine and graphics by now! The VATS system makes the game laughably easy and you can kite any enemy in the game. If you play the game without VATS, the NPCs dodge and weave like a weasel on crack all while maintaining pinpoint accuracy. Although the stories for each quest is better, the execution is still murky at best as one wrong dialogue choice cuts off entire quests. Certain quests are only offered under poorly designed circumstances with NPCs not reacting to successful completions or acting as if you DIDN""T just save their whole city from bad guys. Final analysis: Rushed out to market before true completion in a manner typical of Bethesda. This is essentially DLC for Fallout 3 that they tried (and failed) to pass off as a stand alone game. Although the fan boys, ""independent reviewers"" and paid Bethesda employees will seek to skew these rating sites, the proof is in the lackluster sales and general negative, poor opinion of Bethesda.",Jerik02

But don't go into it expecting much. It is definitely improved over the first game, for sure (except barring the story) but it is hindered by a horrible camera system and lack of imagination. You are no more an assassin than Duke Nukem, something that is corrected I hope, by  the time this series reaches the modern era.It's laughable, because there are points in the game where Ezio, a master ""assassin"" is told by lowly chums how to be more stealthy, and the guy wants to run into palaces like Rambo and kill his targets. Really? There's no stealth to this game, no finesse. The way guards detect you is poor. The game is thus, at times, boringly easy, and unfairly hard (there are certain missions where you must not alert guards, even if you kill the immediately after alerting them, forcing you to restart over and over), especially when the 'context camera' comes into play - there are certain timed platforming sections where, I would rather have Tomb Raider I's camera system than ASII's. It's like Ubisoft hasn't learned from over twenty years of 3d platforming. I don't intend to purchase any more of this series, I've been burnt out by this awful mess (22 hr complete time too, which is kind of short for a single player action game).",anubite

I bit the bullet and got it anyway, and damn pleased I am too.Most of the things that the reviews have issues with are the menu system and the difference in details of the tracks! Firstly, how long do you spend in the menu system of a game? 5% percent of the time maybe, even less! And with regard to the tracks then how exactly do reviewers expect the tracks to look? If the designers are replicating and real track, like Top Gear for example, then they have to make it look like the real thing. They can't just stick some nice tress at the side of the track or have sand dunes peppering the horizon as those things are not at the original site!!!I have been playing this game since Friday and have loved every moment. I have always been a fan of the GT series and I think this the best without doubt.My only griped would be the lack of quality in-race music. In the previous games there has always been a really good mix of tracks, by great bands and DJ's. GT5 has really, really bad music (saved only by Queens of the Stone Age!!!), but like somebody else pointed out, you can switch it off.The other area that reviewers have complained about is the online, but, as I am not a fan of online gaming I cant really comment. My experience of online gaming consists of getting on line, getting shot by some 14 year old inbred moron who hasn't seen the light of day for 14 days and doesn't beleive in the female species and then trying again and failing. With GT5 I got online, joined a race and lost. But it seemed to work pretty well.So far I can only say that my GT5 experience has been a very good one and I hope it stays that way. This is a huuuuge game and there is no way that anybody has seen all that it can deliver. With more patches and updates being delivered on a monthly basis I can only see it getting better and better.If you like driving games and like details and rewards for driving well, then get this game. If you want to drive a car at 200mph, jump off a bridge, do a 360 spin and build your boost bar then get Burnout or some other arcade type racer. This game needs and deserves your attention and in reward you will get a fantastic driving game!!!!",stupidget

I would say though that if you like Ico and SotC you should probably try The Last Guardian.  The Last Guardian to me was a great idea that didn't quite pan out.  To be honest it really feels like a ps2 game.  It is definitely very beautiful in it's own way but I feel it suffers from a lot of problems ps2 games had back in the day that have by now been improved upon and almost perfected like the camera, or hit detection etc.  The camera is the absolute WORST when in tight spaces.  Granted, once the game opens up a bit it's not quite as bad, but when it is bad it is super frustrating.  My other problem is Trico (the bird dog).  Sometimes you will ask Trico to do something and 60% of the time he will either just stare at you like an idiot or do the exact opposite.  I understand that Team Ico wanted to make the relationship a bit more complex by giving Trico a mind of his own, and setting a sort of ""language barrier"", but in my humble opinion that is NOT fun.  I got to a environmental puzzle where I thought I had to get Trico to jump up to a small platform and I kept telling him to jump SEVERAL times and he just wouldn't do it.  Then I started to think that maybe that was not where I was supposed to go so I spent a little over 30 minutes trying to find the way to go.  When I couldn't find anywhere else to go besides up, so I go back to the same EXACT spot I tried before and tell Trico to jump one more time and he does it immediately!  WTF!?  That and the completely absurd camera made this game so frustrating to the point where I almost didn't even finish it, but my friends kept telling me the ending is worth the frustration.  Well, I just finished it and I gotta say it's really good.  The whole story is really good!  It is just a shame that my frustrations with the game totally erase any motivation to ever play it again.  Although I have the utmost respect for both Team Ico and their fans I just can't give The Last Guardian anything higher than a 5.  Like I said the story is definitely worth a play through but with all of the ps2 era problems that have for the most part been fixed by now The Last Guardian should be bought at a very steep discount.",GamerJosh0137

I own every installation - maybe besides CoD 3 - and I'm sorry to say that, but MW3 is truly the biggest rip off of the year. I don't really care for the campaign. I can't see no fun in a 5 hour bot shooting fiesta with a slapstick story, so I'm just going to stick to the MP.I didn't really expect much from the MP. Maybe some changing environments, some new interesting toys. But no... Sledgehammer changed almost nothing. This is the same game as MW2! Like someone said before: it all feels like a really expensive DLC for MW2! I mean, come on... You didn't even make an effort to make the maps interesting (take a look at Launch from Black Ops and the rocket launch or Moon - IMO changing environments rock). The guns? Almost the same. Upgrade system? Basically the same. Game modes? The same. Oops... sorry... You have added one of the dumbest things I have played lately ""Kill Confirmed"". I know it's ""new and fresh"" but why the hell did you put it as part of Ground War? It only forces me to change the lobby every time this mode starts. And there is Elite... You know what? That is the part where You have been most innovative and what happens? You charge me another 50$ for an annual subscription. At this moment I'm restraining myself not to call you names. I believe as an owner of al Your games I should be let in for free, but that is just my opinion. I really thought that You care for your fans, but instead you charge them extra because You know they will want to be part of Elite.To summarise... I'm no hater, but You have failed me Glen. You have played it safe. MW2 was good but playing it safe with MW3 makes it mediocre and charging 60$ for a DLC... well, that is just low... real low.

220894,Fallout 4,PC,6,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Fallout 4 is a fun game, filled with a lot of endless quests and gun play. The problem with Fallout 4 is that it is not really a RPG like the rest of the series. For the majority of the game you will be clearing areas and finding 'bigger and better' loot, and leveling your character to your liking, but that is the game in a nut shell. The only time you have a RPG feel to the game is in the story missions, which in my opinion are short and to the point. There is a lack of universe to this game that would make it one of the best games of all time; it just feels like there should be more game.  I have spent pretty much all of my waking hours not at work on my computer playing this game, and I feel like I'm already done playing it. I really hope that   DLC or mods will expand this game. The only other problem I have with the game is the one sided feeling to it. For the most part, you are a good guy the whole game. In the first few minutes, you are giving power armor, kill a Death Claw, and become the leader of a faction that is in charge of saving the waste land. In short there is no real way to be a bad guy in this game. The darkest you can be in this game is being pissed off that you have to help. If these issues were fixed I would give this game a 10. Fallout 4 is already a fun game, it just needs to be a RPG now.",Icebann

The only reason this game could be considered as more difficult than other games in this genre would be the graphics and lingering champion game-play. The graphics make it difficult to see what exactly is going on and doesn't get much easier as you progress. Pretty much every champion has at least one ability that will root/stun/slow ect. for around 5 seconds. When a game has that kind of kill security it doesn't matter if the champions are Balanced.I've played many other Game in this genre and besides HoN they were all much more enjoyable than DOTA II. When I first played a game or two It was extremely easy compared to league of legends or other similar games. It may be more difficult to see what's going on but the spells are so overpowered on all the champions that it was easy coming from game that have underpowered spells.The worst thing About DOTA II would be the Item system that has been Implemented. It's just ridiculous how it's not user friendly at all. This game has such a bad In-Game and Community Experience that players Uninstall it after playing 1-3 matches. The fact that this game was for sale when it had been released and is now free to play should tell you all you need to know about it.

In the game you are given a choice of starting ship (only one to start, and more unlockable). You command this ship and the crew within on a mission to the Federation's home base to deliver a message of the impending Rebel assault. Along the way you encounter enemy ships and distressed colonies alike having to choose how to resolve each conflict. You are given one life, when you die it's game over. But the game is all the better for it.There is no doubt a percentage of luck in the game that determines the random encounters and their rewards. These will decide what weapons you are able to acquire after battles and from shops along the way. However, it is not solely dependent on luck as others may lead you to believe. There are certain weapon configurations that will make the game easier and more difficult alike, but beyond that the game simply has a large learning curve that many will not master quickly. There is a tactical solution to just about every possible situation, and though luck does prove a factor it is not the sole reason why you would be defeated. Beyond simply weapons and items to buy, you are given full control over the power and upgrade configuration of your shields, weapon system, drone system, engines, O2, Med Bay, Doors (more important than you think), sensors, etc. These play a huge part in whether you will survive or not with your current loadout. FTL isn't merely a dice roll, the game is simply unforgiving. Making a wrong choice early on about what to buy or choosing to finish a fight rather than run will impact the late game. Matching your upgrades to your weapons will determine whether you survive or perish.The game is not perfect, and could stand to have a few more encounters however each time you die it's a learning experience about what you may have done wrong. Each new game is a different experience, and in the 25 hours played I have never had two journeys end the same way. Nor have I ever died for a reason that was not my fault.Currently this game is the closest you will come to piloting your own starship through the galaxy on a mission to save the Federation from destruction.

Of course if you want your levels to actually be how you want them to you've entered the real challenge in this game. The course creator is way too basic. I cant even count how many times I've had a great level idea only to find out it doesn't work. Not because there would be no way to do it but because I have no advanced options. I guess they have to make it easy to learn for all the ten year olds that play this game but it really makes me mad.Another thing I dislike about this game is how you can only upload so many levels. I understand why they limited it but for people like me who have no way of getting the word out and actually make decent levels it feels like I'm not being sold the full game. Unfortunately if you take away the limit you're left with even more terrible levels. You really have no way of winning. Maybe there should be a quality check where people can rate the levels but even that could be manipulated.This brings me to my next complaint. The terrible levels. So not only is the making part frustrating but the playing may be even worse. There are so many people who put no effort into their levels. They just get a bunch of enemies or just add a dev skip so they don't actually have to beat their level. I've played so many bad levels that I cant even think of anything clever to say about it.In conclusion this game is flawed. Very flawed. The fact that it is so expensive is even worse.

Thankfully the story isn't very long and like Far Cry 3 you are free to roam the map after the campaign is complete to do the side missions and take over enemy outposts. But it also has the same problems that Far Cry 3 had like incomplete multiplayer and a few lags and freezes every now and then. It's worth the ten or fifteen bucks for the purchase.",NotoriousFraud

It's pretty evident that alot of passion and difficult choices went into developing this game.I will try to write this review as short as possible.My short opinion: I really enjoyed this game. My enjoyment score would be a 10. However, as you can see, I didn't give it a 10, since a reviewer needs to be as objective as possible(even though this review will contain a lot of subjectivity).The story was entertaining. The way it was presented was interesting as well(no cuts). My only small problem was the pacing. The pacing felt off during certain moments. I don't want to spoil anything about the story and it is just me being nit picky since it isn't a consistent problem.Kratos is also a lot more interesting compared to the previous installments. He isn't one dimensional and you can see him grow as a character as the story progresses. Atreus isn't annoying as well and IMO compliments well with this ""new"" Kratos. Every other characters are interesting and are not ""boring"".Level design is just excellent. The levels are linear, but it has different ""branches"" to explore. Those branches looks interesting and are well thought out. The levels itself looks beautiful. I've played the game on challenge mode without HUD on a FAT PS4 and it is in my opinion the best looking game this generation for the PS4.Sound is like most games good. The music depends on preferences. Voice acting is well done as well. It's on par with other story driven games.Game mechanics:- Combat is well done and has actual depth now. It isn't ""button mashy"". You also have another option to approach the enemies. Instead of depleting their health, you can try to increase their stagger bar to ""one shot"" them with an execution move which is as satisfying as the previous installments. The rage mode also feels more satisfying(a tleast to me).My only problem is that I do miss the jump button. This may however only be a problem for the fans who has played the previous installments.It also has more RPG elements. Instead of just upgrading your weapons like the previous games, it also gives you the option to customize it(aka making it more personal). Kratos and Atreus can also wear ""armors"" and they are customizable as well.Puzzles are also nice and not too difficult. It doesn't take too long to figure out a puzzle, yet it feels satisfying when you solve it. This however may depend on the players and how ""experience"" you are with puzzles in general.The perspective of the camera depends on preferences. I've heard people not liking it, but also people having no problem with the camera angle. From my experience, I had no problem as well and prefer this camera because it's more ""personal"". But again, it depends on your preference.Performance is most of the time consistent. I only had like 3 times of small frame drops.",MrRater

255169,Far Cry 4,XboxOne,5,"As a longtime player of the Far Cry series, and one who was quite pleased with the direction the third installment took, I'll admit that I was looking forward to Far Cry 4 with great anticipation. My first play-through felt like a letdown.I recently picked the game up again, and I can say with absolute certainty: Ubisoft really needs to do better with the upcoming #5.There are aAs a longtime player of the Far Cry series, and one who was quite pleased with the direction the third installment took, I'll admit that I was looking forward to Far Cry 4 with great anticipation. My first play-through felt like a letdown.I recently picked the game up again, and I can say with absolute certainty: Ubisoft really needs to do better with the upcoming #5.There are a number of positive things to say, of course. The game world is enormous, graphics are detailed (actual, decent-looking fur even on a console? Yes, that's pretty good.), and missions are varied. The added gameplay mechanic of a branching storyline - while by no means new - is well implemented and adds depth to the game. Much of the voice acting is spot-on, with Naveen Andrews and Janina Gavankar turning in outstanding performances, not to mention the outstanding work of Troy Baker as the game's primary antagonist, Pagan Min. (Much has been said of FC3's Vaas, voiced by Michael Mando. Make no mistake: Baker's work is every bit as good. They're two entirely different characters, each requiring a specific approach. In the case of Vaas, that meant over-the-top, out-of-his-skull crazy, which Mando delivered. Pagan requires something a little more...frayed-nerves, looking at the world through a very warped lens. Baker nailed it to the exact same level as Mando.) The variety of vehicles is a nice addition, with the new Buzzer microlight helicopter a particularly welcome - if disturbingly unbalancing - addition. And, of course, the wide world of Far Cry weapons and their attachments, which worked so well in FC3, is back and just as good.A substantial improvement over FC3 is the inclusion of Takedown skills earlier in the game. By allowing players access to nearly the entire skill tree from the start - albeit with prerequisites, of course - players can hone their hand-to-hand skills early enough to be more than the relative gimmick they were in FC3.So why the trashing on the score? Well, to put it bluntly, nobody balanced this game. It's...absurd, really. In all situations and at all difficulty levels, the enemy AI is capable of zeroing in on the player almost instantly (even in ""blizzard conditions"" where ""the enemy will have difficulty locating you"" and using silenced weapons, they're on you almost right away). That wouldn't be so bad if only the damage system were square, but it's not; you'll get pummeled quickly, while enemies just soak up damage. (Show me one human being that can take two rounds of 7.62 to center mass with only a parka for cover and keep fighting without pause, and I'll show you that it's the frickin' Hulk.) Since the entire game is built around combat, it's a glaring oversight.Ladle on top of that the fact that you're the only one in fighting this war that seems to be able to do anything, and the frustration level skyrockets. Despite being surrounded by ""allies,"" their ability to hit a target, hold an objective, or basically do anything but fire randomly is pretty much nil. What they can do is fire rounds into the air like the imbeciles they are as they celebrate a victory they had nothing to do with. Once you're that annoyed, things like incessant eagle attacks (against which you can't defend efficiently) and the ridiculously short in-game voice script just serve to irk you even more.(Note for would-be developers: if you're going to go with the ""quirky radio personality that talks about in-game events and the world,"" *give them more than nine lines to say.* Fallout 3 did fine with Three-Dog because he had stuff to say. Rabi Ray Rana in FC4 is just an annoying short tape loop. No fault to the actor; fault to Ubisoft for giving the writing short shrift. The same goes for the announcer in Shanath Arena, who sounds like a cheap rip-off of Edwin Hodgeman's Dr. Dealgood from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Sitting through the same 20-second pointless intro listening to the same [bleeping] lines just drives up the old blood pressure.)In short, it's a game with a great setting, concept, and build, crippled by a developer's choice to shortchange writing AGAIN and refusal to balance the game properly before release.So why review it now, three years after release? Because FC5 is coming up, and these days Ubisoft tends to double down on mistakes they've made in the past. Hopefully they'll up their game (no pun). Just be aware before you plonk down your preorder money.",Oxcart

This was one of the definitive power armor mods out there.-Weather effects, including radiation storms.-Custom variants of already included weapons.-Settlement building (Real-time Settler)-Layered armorAnd a ton more...In regards to the perk tree... It does feel watered down, but it also feels like, just like with the dialog, choice matters more. Instead of arbitrary skill points that add simple multipliers for you to work towards, you're instead given half your usual SPECIAL amount from previous titles, and perk options that carry a lot more weight. Instead of stat raising for combat and picking more diplomatic or resourceful perks, you're left with only the option to either invest in combat that level, invest in resourcefulness, or raise your SPECIAL to work toward something. The system actually feels a lot more unforgiving than the previous iteration, so I can only see it as an improvement.Same with dialog. While there may not be a defined karma system, karma is still technically there with the weight of conversation choices and your actions in general. In this game, it's less like karma is needed and more like it's completely redundant. This game just doesn't have a need for a system that was already sub-par to begin with.Overall, this game is a beefed up Fallout 3 with a significantly more immersive experience, more intuitive controls, and vastly superior graphics (which actually look better than the newest Call of Duty, yet people say they're garbage for some reason).I recommend this title to everyone. It is perhaps the best Fallout title to date. It is by far the best Bethesda title to date as well.If you want a stat management game - a genre that's been on it's way out since Mass Effect, go try Pillars of Eternity or Wasteland 2. Leave your shallow and dated statistical elements out of our immersive RPG experiences.I thought I would edit this to include two things:1) I play on survival difficulty. While not really as 'Fun' as Hardcore mode in New Vegas, it is definitely more challenging.2) I play with a Keyboard and Mouse. This question was asked of me. I thought I would state it.",Envy661

With so long in the making everyone expected big things with improvement thats would blow your mind, and if you pay homage to that then of course you could give the game nothing more than a ZERO and im sure so many of the reviews come from that view point.If you put all that aside and just look at it from the merit of the game it is then, it has some crisp graphics, moments of a great racing game and feeling of competition but it is so often clouded with the feeling of an imcomplete game that after all this time is still buggy, unpolished and not on par with other games in the genre. All things considered, the sound is the biggest let down by far, with dynamic crashes sounding like nothing more than a plastic coke bottle hit you in the hit, engines that resemble cards stuck on the spokes of your bike ( ah chlld hood memories ) and a sound track that is just a resume for people to find there place in the job que down at the local supermarket.I feel disappointed and robbed of the expierence that should have been a great game, but after the hype and constant delays should we have really expected that this would result in something great, as I cant remember a time where something game, movie, tv show, anything was delayed and the final product was worth the extra wait.",raefon

Why isThis is my honest opinion on BO3. Black ops 3 isn't a f*ckin terrible game but theres also nothing that makes it stand out from other call of duty games. The campaign is the worst part of BO3 in my opinion. The campaign starts off okay but once I got about a third into I was continually asking myself what is going on? why is this happening? Why is there a WW2 mission is this game? Why is there almost nothing that connects it to other treyarch CODs?. The campaign felt like a chore I really didn't want to do but I pushed myself to the end. Nightmare mode is the same thing but with zombies as enemies. If I was to say anything good about the campaign is that you can 4 player co op and you can pick your loadout which is something carried over from BO2, this allows you to explore and experiment with different weapons and abilities. The multiplayer and zombies do fair better then the campaign. Multiplayer runs very smoothly at 60fps, but the multiplayer feels like a direct reskin of BO2 but with jumping and swimming mechanics. Weather that's a good or bad thing is up to you. I would have liked to have seen more brand new modes but Im sure those are to come. It still holds all of the classic modes from previous CODs. Now for the zombies, the main reason I bought the game. Zombie mode feels much harder and more complicated then ever before. I didn't enjoy as much as previous zombie modes but it is more challenging then previous games weather that's a good thing or not is entirely up to you. Der reise makes a return as the giant but it honestly doesn't feel the same. DLC is the same a season pass and personalization packs. Overall this game is a 6/10, Its a solid shooter for sure, its not bad but its also not particularly good either. Im sure this will be a 7/10 once they bring out all the dlc.

Yes they made some mistakes like taking away coop. But they still made a lot of things right. They now putted some boss fights in the game and they are awesome and extremely fun. They removed some of the enemies but they also putted even more new good ones in. They have now removed the old multiplayer mode and made a new one (you can play split screen in the multiplayer mode) where you and your alliaces have to fight your way through aliens and complete the missions. There is 3 different classes that you can choose between. It is really cool. But i didn't like that there is even less scary moments in this one then the first one. Of course there where a bit of them but not enough. The first one didn't have that much of scary moments neither. But it at least kept the creepy atmosphere (which was amazing).

Eventually this game went on sale and because of the extremely positive reception I decided to give it a try. I  didn't regret buying this game and would've bought it at launch for the full price. I'll start off by explaining the gameplay. This game is easily one of the best RPGs I have ever played, and for me, it's easily better than Skyrim. The voice acting is superb. The animation is amazing. The story is intriguing. The characters have personality. The maps are well designed. The quests all feel different. The game is amazing but as much as I praise the game I do have problems with it. My biggest gripe with the game, which made me not play it after a while, is the loading screens. The loading screens in the game are massive. I was doing a quest in the game which involved hunting down a werewolf, seems easy enough. Well werewolfs happen to be extremely hard enemies to face, but that was not my problem. My problem was that every time I died I ended up going through one of the game's loading screens. Due to me being extremely determined to finish this quest I ended up dying a lot, which in turn, meant more loading screens. There was some annoying narrative at the beginning of the loading screens, which got annoying really quickly. This ended up with me getting sick of this and quitting the game all together. I haven't found the motivation to open the game again and end up playing till the end, but from what I saw of the game, I can confidently say that, if you are a fan of RPGs and games like Skyrim, this game is for you. This game would've been my game of the year if I wasn't such a Soulsborne fanboy. 9/10 too many loading screens 4 me.",kietnam

As a consequence of removing fuel they inadvertently made fighters far less survivable.2) The original game had support for telling your ships to keep a stance of aggressive or evasive for extra damage or extra survivability... this is just gone.3) Formations of ships completely break up as soon as they encounter the enemy.... they may as well be set to 'fly randomly'4) Bugs, bugs, bugs....  I am dumbfounded how they managed to introduce so many of them.-The game wouldn't run on day 1 until I did some settings arcana.  I'm not running a weird build, win7_64, yet these problems happened... unacceptable.-The game frequently misses mission triggers, e.g. in the asteroid mission I've completed it yet the Bentusi never show up... the mission just never ends.-In the previous mission I captured an enemy carrier.  When it came out of the mothership as a friendly carrier it started to disgorge ~20 enemy interceptors....-Resource harvesters keep getting stuck due to incompetent pathingReally this feels like a beta...

The core gameplay isn't much new, but the element of stopping time requires thought, trial, error, and planning. Each level is a short burst of scenario gold. One might be an instigated bar fight, another a parking garage shootout, and another a rooftop brawl. The gameplay is a major strength here, the only problems being more of a nuisance than actual problems. The controls, specifically the mouse controls, can feel a little on the undersensitive side, but the other aspects are perfectly easy to learn. The story is, again, not much new, but it's presented in a minimalistic, meta-fictional way that its intriguing throughout the 2-3 hour playthrough. It's the type of element that isn't going to be the first thought on any players' mind, but the developers clearly thought it through and wrote a sizeable chunk of good narrative. Graphically, it doesn't disappoint. It's simple, polygonal, and stark, with white backgrounds and set-pieces, red enemies, and black objects and weapons. It looks great using this style of technologically inspired assets and will surprise many. The game finally recognizes its strength; after beating the story, a few other modes are unlocked, a challenge mode and an endless mode. Both of these require little explanation but know that they will both extend your playtime pretty far ahead. Is it worth $25? I'm not entirely convinced.

Also if the enemies are even 1 level higher than your party, you're likely to get your ass whooped, especially if you're fighting a group of such enemies.Money is very easy to make in the game, as you can basically go into the rich people's mansions and robe them blind while you distract them with a party member and then switch to another and sneak around picking paintings off the walls and gold/silver stuff from around the house. It's easy to not get caught. Not to mention you will find some very good weapons and armor in some chests.

The story is not interesting and the writing is just horribly boring. I am not sure how this is above a 8.0. Its not like the RPG elements have not been done before in every infinity engine game. This game plays it too safe. It needs something to call its own. Text boat battles dont do it.First the good. There are a lot of class options for player customization. I actually enjoy creating unique characters and trying different combinations. I settled on a monk/wizard using staffs which makes sense and actually did fairly well in the time I played the game.The not so good but still ok.Graphics are decent but areas are very small and it feels static. Everything seems to be voice acted which is nice, except the voices were inappropriate for the game. Some voice actors are great which is why I am placing this here but others are atrocious for the setting. See below for an explanation. Combat is iffy.The combat ok but the interface design is very poor. For an action style RPG, they went out of their way to place important information out of the action (view) area requiring you to take your eye off the action to see characters conditions. For example, there were a few situations where my characters almost died and I never even noticed they got hit. This is because health indicators are not above the characters but down below outside of view. Also the camera does not turn, a negative for a modern game with a large budget because it means that at times, its hard to see due to bad angles. The menus are terrible popup sub-menus inside of menus inside of other menus... terrible gui design. Still combat itself is not bad inherently but they added absolutely nothing new.Last, the bad stuff...#1 Completely UN-immersive. This is a two parter. First, this game that takes itself very seriously (like the 1st) but the story is high school level silly. The two simply do not mix. If you are going to take yourself this seriously, you better have a grade A story and dialog to back it up otherwise it will be a complete drag. I barely got to the 2nd island and I dreaded clicking on an NPC because I didnt want to hear more about the Watcher or get another fetch my money quest... There is a little bit of comic relief but it is very far and few between.Second, the accents... oh my god they are so out of place that snap you right out of the game entirely. The girl (Xoti) and her mom, with the southern accents were a complete turn off. I made a mistake by recruiting her but I didnt want miss any content so I usually recruit everyone. I just turned down the volume and started reading so I didnt have to do a double take every time she spoke. But that was not the only accent out of place. The Italian accent is also completely out of place and through the 1st 5 hours it seems that half of the population was Italian. How did someone think that this would be immersive in a game that is as serious as this one? It would have been great for a comedy but not here.#2 Group AI is completely borked and unreliable. For example, the AI does not even turn on if your characters are moving at the start of an encounter. It takes them about 5-10 seconds before the AI kicks in and in the meantime, they enemies will get 2 rounds off against characters that are just sitting there doing nothing. Since I play on the highest difficulty, this means that at times, 1 character is dead before the AI even starts up so I had to micro everything. Also, the AI turns off for a bit if you directly order your characters to use a special ability. All this means you have to constantly micro everyone in the party or you will have serious problem at higher difficulties even against trash enemies. This makes every battle a huge drag. You need to do a lot of pausing and clicking and pausing and click and pause and click every few seconds. Too much repetition. Macro'ing in this game is not fun, fair, nor balanced. If you micro everything the game becomes nearly trivial. If you dont micro you will lose to laughable enemies... POE1 had similar problems and I got bored of that quickly too. Baldurs Gate was never like this. They need to fix the AI and reduce the number of clicks (better gui).Ultimately, I played about 10 hours and I was so bored that I didnt want to continue. I may go back to play this again later but right now, just seeing the game icon makes me feel sleepy.",marc5477

244757,Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate,WiiU,10,"Let me level with you. I'm a huge Monster Hunter series fan. Does that make my review biased? Probably. Does it mean I actually have played the game and know what I'm talking about before reviewing? Definitely.First of all, some truths. This game had been called a re-release of older Monster Hunter titles, however that's not entirely true. Think of it more of an EXPANSION of olderLet me level with you. I'm a huge Monster Hunter series fan. Does that make my review biased? Probably. Does it mean I actually have played the game and know what I'm talking about before reviewing? Definitely.First of all, some truths. This game had been called a re-release of older Monster Hunter titles, however that's not entirely true. Think of it more of an EXPANSION of older titles (Monster Hunter Tri for the Wii and Monster Hunter Portable 3rd for the PSP that only came out in Japan). Does this mean that the graphics are old and outdated, or downright ugly at parts, seeing as it's an HD re-hash of PSP graphics? Yes. If cutting edge technology and graphics is what you're looking for, this is not the game (or indeed series) for you.However, does that make the game any less good? Actually, no. And that's because CAPCOM has always made this series with attention to detail for things that matter. Sure, the polygon models are low count, the textures are old and low-res and the special effects will not blow your mind. But the character animations, monster animations, the monsters' AI, and generally things that make this feel less of a game and more of an ecosystem that you actually go into to hunt huge monsters, are polished and really well done.This has always been the staple of this series, and MH3U doesn't disappoint. Every time you're spotted by a big monster, should you crouch and hide, it will be wary of you but usually will not attack you and eventually might lose interest and leave. Throwing so much as a stone at it though and it will defend itself and attack you. If a monster is sensitive to sounds, it will be surprised and disorientated for a few moments after you use a sonic bomb. If a monster is clinging on the ceiling of a cave, shoot it with a bow or bowgun at its feet for long enough and it will lose grip and drop. If a monster has horns and charges at you, get behind a wall and it might get stuck on it with its horns. Break the horns of the same monster, and it no longer can get stuck on walls. It is little things like that, which, when added together, show the immense amount of work and polish that has gone into this game series.So, even though this game is graphically old, and is based on an old Wii game, is it worth your money and time? Yes, because the amount of content in this game is triple the amount of content of that in the Wii version, perhaps even more. Yes, because this series was never about graphics or technological feats, it was always about attention to detail of the monsters (their ecosystems, quirks, attributes) and the battle system (ways and strategies to fight them and so forth). Yes, because even though many people complain this game's battle is slow and sluggish, or the camera controls are weird, they're missing the point. The game is SUPPOSED to handle like that from design. It is a design choice, implemented to make the player feel that they really ARE holding heavy swords and lances in their hands, while fighting 20 ton dragons. You can't wimp and cancel out of any and all of your attacks, because if you're holding a sword almost as big as you and swing it, it makes sense you can't control its weight after doing so. You must plan your strategy, anticipate attacks, look for openings, use tools at your disposal to outwit the monster and make the hunt easier.This is NOT a hack and slash game. You'll get rewarded for knowing your adversaries, and punished severely for attacking head-on mashing the attack buttons, to the point that a monster that takes you 40 minutes when charging blindly with no plan, could take you less than 10 minutes if you go in with a plan, the right tools and strategy.Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is an Action RPG, or even, an Action Game with RPG elements, where the player gets better, not their character. Sure, you forge new weapons and armors, and there's literally thousands of them in the game, created from parts (scales, shells) of the monsters you fight, but there's no leveling system or exp to gain. Even given the best armor and weapon for a specific monster, a player will fail to defeat it if they are not aware of its attacks, quirks, and tools/strategies they should use. Simply put, if I give my end-game character to a friend who's an avid action game or action RPG player and ask him to defeat one of the end-game monsters, they will simply fail, lacking the experience as a player that this game rewards you for.So if you're looking for a game that focuses 100% on the GAMEplay and its mechanics and 0% on its story, exposition, graphics or presentation, a game where the fun stems from becoming a better player at it, and being rewarded constantly as if you yourself did something, this game is for you. The multiplayer co-op is a great experience too, with a huge feeling of bonding and achievement every time you and your buddies take down something huge that took nearly an hour. Expect hundreds of hours of fun in the world of MH3U.",Azel34

I wish reviewers, professional ones in particular, could recognize that people like different things in their games and I wish their reviews would reflect this fact, instead of pushing their bias unto others, claiming their judgement as Absolute. Bottomline: if you like pretty graphics, interactions with your environment  such as learning a trade and getting married,  and a huge open-world to move around in you'll probably enjoy Skyrim a lot.

The story is decent enough, but a let down compared to the first game, and not nearly as clever in its commentary about the world or video games. The best part of the game is your sidekick, Elizabeth, who is a sidekick done right and uses a very clever mechanic to make herself useful and meaningful, but the game itself failed to make itself dynamic enough for her to be used to her full potential.The story of the original Bioshock is what really made the game special. Unfortunately, this game's story is not up to the level of the first game's story; you don't feel the same drive onward, and, unfortunately, because of the first game's twist, it is more obvious that there is going to be a twist in this one, which somewhat bothered me as I saw the twist coming from the very start of the game.Unlike in the previous games, in Bioshock Infinite, your character, Booker DeWitt, has both a name and a personality. Booker speaks up throughout the game, talking to the various NPCs, and especially to his sidekick, Elizabeth.The best and worst part of the game is the various transitions between realities; not only do you draw things between worlds, but you actually travel between worlds at various points in the game, to realities where things played out differently, including (eventually) a reality wherein Booker died after coming to the city.The problem, ultimately, is that the game never really delivers on the story; it is alright, but it isn't spectacular, and the world-skipping, while a neat idea, never really ends up having the punch that it should, as well as making it so that what we did earlier didn't really matter in that particular world (or maybe it did - who knows?). The whole ""dead in one world, alive in another"" thing is never really properly explored or followed up on, even though it was built up in significance, and the end result is that while it advanced the plot it really failed to make the game awesome.The ultimate weakness of this game lies in its gameplay. Bioshock Infinite is every bit the sequel to the previous Bioshock games, and this isn't a good thing - the gameplay is very similar to what it was in previous games, and while the enemy variety is a bit better in this game, there's nothing quite as exciting as some of the Big Daddy fights were in the first game. The Handymen are alright replacements for them, and make for reasonable enough fights, and your first fight against the various new types of enemies is neat enough, but as with the previous games, the lack of real bosses hurts the game a bit.The normal soldiers who are running around in most of the game are not terribly difficult or interesting enemies to fight, and while some of the battlefields are very interesting and dynamic and make good use of Elizabeth's powers, many of the fights are the opposite - very static things where you just hide behind cover and shoot the enemies, gradually grinding your way through the group without changing what you had summoned into the fight with Elizabeth at all. Elizabeth's powers are really neat, but without a reason to run around during the fight (something some of the special enemies provided at times, especially the handymen, as well as some of the more interesting environmental setups) they often didn't end up very interesting as they just were a piece of whatever I summoned in at the start to help me, rather than something I brought in mid-fight to swing things in my favor.The actual weapons in the game were very standard for a FPS, with the usual assortment of weapons, and unfortunately the upgrades system really encouraged you to try and stick to as few weapons as possible so that you could make the most use out of your upgrades - this is one of the major flaws of upgrade systems, in that they actually frequently reduce the variety of gameplay by encouraging you to not use a variety of weapons. Some of the weapons were also vastly better than others, and by the end of the game you pretty much had your pick of which weapon to use most of the time, rather than giving you a scavenging feel.The vigors are supposed to help mix things up from the usual FPS point of view, and it is nice to have weird weapons in a game, but ultimately I only ended up using a small number of the vigors - really, the only good ones were the ones which temporarily incapacitated foes, including the one that gave me a free ally for a bit, and as a result I pretty much only used three vigors through most of the game. They also didn't fit into the world at all thematically.All in all, the gameplay didn't really match the ambiance the story seemed to be trying to create, and the gameplay was too slow for the game itself - the game would have been better if it had avoided making you run around looking for change all the time.",TitaniumDragon

Story On the other hand is much much better than the previous installments & you actually feel the dread & sorrow that the gears would be feeling.Graphics Like always are topnotch.A couple of new characters are introduced, but id would have been nice to get a bit more of a backstory on the newcomers. The introduction of lambent enemies really makes you change your playstyle from previous gears as enemies are far more aggressive.One Impotrtant thing to note here is that Difficulty levels have been altered significantly. So if u used to play gears on normal difficulty than go with hardcore , cause the game has become just TOO EASY!Even in hardcore mode one can at times finish whole levels without shooting a single bullet! Sadly, Insane mode is unlocked only after finishing the campaign :( All in All Its Pretty much what i expected (which is near perfect) , This Game Has Lots of modes and tons of collectibles,skins,gun themes to unlock thus giving it a huge replayibility bonus.So...

They're not there. There are lots of games out there with a much more genuinely diverse cast of characters, and without all of this skeevy sexism intended to result in porn.Did you know that major porn sites had to block 'Overwatch' searches and uploads because it was getting out of hand? It was all over the gaming news because it pretty much exemplifies what Overwatch is about. It's a skeevy porn game. And the game is designed to be as comforting and as easy as possible to reach as many perverts as possible.It's overly easy, slow paced, and nothing about it requires any skill whatsoever. It's basically what would happen if Candy Crush Saga and Team Fortress 2 had a kid, and then that kid was raised by a skeevy uncle with regressive views about women. That's exactly what it is. And with the tiny amount of content present and how lazily designed it all is, it just felt like a rip off to me.There are just better experiences out there.

Granted not perfect but obviously its combo of incredible graphics, textures, gorgeously fitting color pallet, and stunning frame rate (60fps) make it a visual masterpiece with best in class aesthetics dominating its commonly compared borderlands and fallout 3 bretheren in this department. Guns feel heavy, gunshots sound aggressive and badass, and enemies react to every shot they are hit with  in a realistic way with impressively animated deaths. The animators at id software knocked it out the park with the games many fluid and jaw dropping animations, from crazed mutants ravenously coming after you, to salty bandits flailing back from gunfire ultimately spinning and falling face first to their death these animations are handled with a smoothness and degree of movement not often(if ever) seen in the video game industry. The sound shines with the vaunted John Goodman lending his voice acting talents. The game isn't short with all the side quests and loot hunting offered as well as a very arcade like but enjoyable racing and vehicle combat section (though a bit easy). The weapons are varied enough with all guns and crossbow having several different ammo types, but the clear cut star of your arsenal is the innovative and devilishly fun wing stick. The wing stick is a type of three bladed boomerang that you throw at your enemies for frequent decapitations and severed limbs, it also can be upgraded to target enemies,do more damage, and return to your hand like a boomerang (did i mention it can slice the head off of multiple enemies in a row).You also find or buy blueprints in the wasteland which build new weapons/guns, upgradable turrets and robots, and even a mini remote controlled truck with bombs attached to it which you can remote detonate (also useful for scouting out enemy camps). You do however rehash the same levels at times with minor differences but with having to make such detailed landscapes it's understandable. The game includes many enjoyable mini games such as five finger fillet, a guitar hero like game called strum, and a very fun card game similar to magic the gathering with picture cards of different in game characters and factions that you find throughout the wasteland to strengthen your deck(trust me i am not a card or magic t.g. fan but this is fun). The world isn't as big as fallout but it is as big as it needs to be.It has a fun but not as varied separate coop campaign and online multiplayer in the form of exciting vehicle combat races. I know it isn't the 4 player coop of borderlands but unless you are the type who is compulsive about having 50,000 guns and cell shaded graphics it might be a better all around game than the first borderlands(i do love borderlands by the way). People say Rage doesn't  have a story and it has an ""okay"" if not fleshed out enough story but borderlands though it is entertaining has basically no story at all(you are on pandora- now find this vault).Some found Rage to have a weak ending? Not half as dissapointing as borderlands ending (can anyone say they were pleased with what they found in the vault?) Overall Rage is a breath of fresh air that beckons back to id's yesteryear of gaming (doom,quake) the combat is in your face and aggressive differing from this generation's Gears of Wear totally cover based  pop and shoot style of combat (when i am a badass muscle bound space marine i don't want to spend 75% of the game on my knees, i know a few gals who hangout on the corner they can give marcus pheonix a pair of kneepads  they spend alot of time on their knees too).Rage has a ton of nostalgic eastereggs too, if you are a Doom,wolfenstein, Quake or id fan you need to get this game for the eastereggs alone! I won't spoil it but let's just say these eastereggs are very.....interactive. The sad thing is that Rage2 was in the works but seeing how Rage undersold they cancelled production and killed the would be series. This was new IP from the fathers of FPS and after all that time they delivered, and after getting their feet wet in this generation with Rage i can assume building on Rage's engine and the experience with Rage would have prepped them to deliver even bigger on Rage2 (can you imagine what that game would of looked like.) Rage is a very strong game and worth the experience it should have sold 5mil. Rage gets a 9  out of 10.",iamTylerDurden

Heinous multiplayer maps. I couldn not believe Crytek would let us down like this, until I discovered this game wasn't made by them!!! WHAT!? This game was made by Ubisoft, the original makers of FC had nothing to do with it, which explains everything. It doesn't deserve the name Far Cry.",Mike

The  Bad part: many of the weapons look and feel similar, the unlock prosess feel a littlebit grindy, some minor bugs, some balance issues (smal ones) and a steep learningcurve (no tutorial and explanation for what's going on).You CAN ulock everything (not cosmetic items) just by playing, but it will take alot of time.And the starting weapons and loadouts are very good, it's almost all skillbased how good you will do in the game.So it's a OK Microtransactions system, but time-consuming if you don't want to spend a dime.Download and try it for yourself, You have nothing to loose since it's F2P =)",ScepticalBanana

However... if you liked that first one, you might love this one.It very obviously is a follow-up, and a tiny bit of ""more of the same"", but the devs really managed to improve quite a few things and added some new mechanics.I'd like to start by one of the main-points of TotalBiscuits review: ""If you didn't like the first remake of Xcom by Firaxis, you won't like this one either"". However... if you liked that first one, you might love this one.It very obviously is a follow-up, and a tiny bit of ""more of the same"", but the devs really managed to improve quite a few things and added some new mechanics.Graphics and performanceWhile graphics might not be as essential in a strategy game, it surely doesn't hurt if the game looks nice, and this one does. The chars don't look as beautiful and detailed as, say, in W3, but the game does look really nice, and you get to see quite a lot of the details you put in when you create your characters.Performance-wise, this might need a patch or two to improve stability. It didn't crash, but there are some framerate-drops, and some laggy moments, where, at the end of a turn, there is a weird delay, or sometimes, the game ""stops"" on the ""fly to mission loading screen"". Again, no crashes.Gameplay (mostly about the changes compared to the previous game)It works pretty much like the first Xcom. Turn-based, overwatch, etc, all the stuff is still there. However, Firaxis added quite a few new abilities, some of them really helping to turn the tide in an intense encounter. I really wasn't excited about melee, seeing alien-hunters swinging swords. I thought it was pretty silly, not making sense.However, the rangers are great for stealthy approaches, their attacks can be very powerful, and with some upgrades, you can move them out of harms way once you have slain an alien.The game is set in the future, a few years after the first game, so it makes sense that you get new gear, new abilities and tech. Some of the new suits and special abilities (like items that create mirages of your guys, which will draw the enemies attention) are pretty dang cool.However, the aliens did do some research too and did get some upgrades. The thin men now have a new look and abilities, and there are some all new heavy units which will give you quite a fight (I especially hate the AT-AT-like ones...gosh, those are tough).Some people have commented that the game is a bit more balanced, as in no more unfair and pretty much impossible moves by the aliens. However, I didn't notice too much of that in the first Xcom, even though I played that a lot, too. So there is no ""god powers"" for the aliens, they also miss shots quite often, and there is some room for error.Some cool new abilities, like hacking (even mobs, disabling them for a while or even mind-controlling them), the drones that specialists use are cool etc. One thing I love is ""serial"", a sniper ability. If you activate it and then manage to kill an enemy with your snipe-ability, you don't lose action points. So you can eg. weaken some mobs with a grenade on one guy, and when it's your snipers turn, you can kill them one by one in just one turn.The game does feel a bit tougher than the first one, yet not to the point where it is frustrating (I heard though that the final mission is VERY VERY tough, you will probably lose a bunch of your guys). Just like in the previous game, losing one of your soldiers, especially those you might have named after a rl-person, hurts, especially if they have reached a high rank.What people seem to dislike, and one thing I am not fond of, is the amount of timed missions, with a limited amount of turns. There were some in part 1, and that was ok,... it was a nice change of pace, was a challenge, and made sense. However, having TOO many of them is... not always fun. Sure, it can be a blast to beat those, but if you really like to approach stuff tactically, try to keep your guys safe, set up perfect ambushes etc, well those timers will make that tough.You may wanna consider download a mod from the workshop which will extend those timers.I enjoy this a LOT. Wasnt sure whether I'd like the even more futuristic setting and look and the sword-class, but it turns out that this is a carefully crafted, improved take on the first remake. If you liked that one, definitely check this one out!Pros:- Looks great- Fun new updates and tech and abilities for both you and the aliens- Said techniques and abilities allow some all new strategies- Some nice new missions and progression/choice system (world map)- Challenging- Apparently, more variety in the maps you play on and the way things are set up- High replayability (had to start over twice, once to make up for mistakes I had made and apply stuff I had learned, and the second time because of a savegame broken by a mod that was removed from the workshop, and I didn't mind restarting at all!)- SOme weaknesses of Xcom were removed- Workshop enabled, with mods on day 1- ChoicesCons:- Some performance issues (my system: i4790, 16 gb ram, GTX 960 with 4 gb, W7)- Too many timed missions, ymmv",danstew

The engrossing narrative and vibrant atmosphere never felt dull or contrived, and in the games final hours you can't help but feel that you are an integral part of the action as you battle your way towards ME2's epic conclusion.  That being said I wish that the RPG portion of the game was more fleshed out i.e. companion armor, more equipment and shield choices, as well a full fledged loot system.  I also found the difficulty system to be a bit unbalanced, the game too easy on normal or lower which makes most ammo and biotic talents useless and unnecessary.  I actually found that ME2 truly  shined on insanity difficulty when it forced you to think tactically because taking almost any damage was simply not an option.  A great example of this is at any point when you encounter husks.  Husks are armored at higher difficulties and you and your team can easily get swarmed and die in seconds.  Cryo ammo, which I honestly gave up using during my first normal difficulty play-through, became my best friend.  Had I never played ME2 on insanity difficulty, I feel this review score might be several points lower because I would have failed to truly understand the finer points of ME2's mechanics. Overall I found the graphics, voice acting, animations, and environment design to be on par or better than most games this generation, and only one notable glitch during Tali's recruitment mission which occurred on both of my play-throughs.

Ok, I can't change that ...The  VATS system looks like a console player tool made to help them aim the body parts they want.

You won't need your brain building your character.IA : No IA. Not even a try.UI : Probably one of the worst UI I have ever seen. Completely console oriented. Nothing to discuss ... not pc-friendly.Loot interface is not intuitive, no drag and drop ...Character/weapons/skill interface is a nightmare (click / click / click / click and more clicks for a simple task).Storyline and quests : If you are looking for an immersive game with good interactions between the different characters ... look elsewhere ! Because the story is trash and not well written.Supposed emotional cutscenes are hilarious ... because there's no emotion at all !The thing is, even with emotionless faces like this game have, the game should at least try to make you feel something ... well, it doesn't ... why bother ?As I said before, boring tedious repetitive quests ...My Fallout 4 experience was like I was playing a F2P korean shooter game but with really bad graphics, bad optimization and an attempt to do some kind of RPG out of it.It was so painful I wanted to stab my brain with a q-tip  ... multiple times.",LordDoberman

For instance:Settlement Creations- Feels like a rushed concept, it's unappealing, and pretty difficult to work with. It is, by no means, a requirement, but Bethesda sure talked it up a lot.Weapon Modding- Cool concept, but poorly executed. Having to hunt for scrap items with screws in the wasteland is just as annoying as it sounds, and the entire system pretty much boils down into being a chore.Dialogue- A partially interesting concept, and it is acted out rather well, but it deeply takes away from the RPG characterization. Not that this game is much of an RPG to begin with. The fact that there is only one voice selection per gender is seriously annoying as well.Despite this stuff, it does do a few good things. The gunplay is extensively improved, there are a lot of companions to choose from (But ""Leveling' them with weapons and armor is nearly inexistent, at least in my experience) and it still has an open world to explore. The game is fun more often than it is not, I'll give it that.I despise the leveling system. In a massive gutting of RPG elements, Bethesda decided to remove stats, and replace them solely with perks. It's a pretty annoying system- especially when it comes to crafting weapons and armor.Overall, the game isn't bad, but it certainly isn't the effigy of greatness we were promised, and is more than a bit disappointing. It's plagued with issues, but at the end of the day, a lot it still feels satisfying.",thelemonman11

There was no story objective and no directions on what to do or were to go, that's all up to the Player to decide. There is so much to talk about this game because of the endless thing you can do in this game, but a video game with this much experience as this and how popular it is mind blowing, the merchandise is huge and many mods to play and download assuming you have the PC version. Minecraft for the PlayStation3 is a game that I can recommend to anyone who has a very creative mind especially for a sandbox game like this, but I can't recommend this to anyone because the game doesn't tell you what to do or how you should do it, it will give you directions for controls when you first start the game, but when you first start up your first world without not knowing for what to do, your not gonna get very far with this game to begin with. But as an experience I can recommend trying it out, the most decent of directions of what to do comes from the Minecraft wiki that tells you how to craft, cook, make houses, etc. It took me a few years to be good at this and all of that experience came from that site, Minecraft playing it for your first time without knowing what to do will become hard to achieve a positive experience, but for trying it out as an experience it's great. I find Minecraft a fantastic game because of the endless things you can do in this game and it took years to finally understand everything about this game.

Lots of movies, lots of games have really horrible ending and you know what that's okay. The developers wanted that ending so they gave us that ending. We cant be spoil and want everything to be perfect cause nothing in life is perfect.  Even if the ending was different people would still find ways to critique this game. Overall..like i said..This is a great game. Im new to the mass effect franchise and this is the first one that i played and i love it. Nothing is wrong with it. Don't let little things or silly things, non important things change your opinion. The game play the overall feel of the game is great. Which is what matters at the end of the day.",boreDudex

It really captures the grimness of the game world. Everything looks creepy, even your heroes!GAMEPLAY - Unique and good! Lots of fun mechanics and resources to manage. Won't super get into the nitty-gritty here. You'll find yourself using heroes again and again, driving them to madness and despair, just to earn money. Then you dismiss them and leave them to their fate, or you drive them so hard they die screaming in the dungeons. Eventually as the game progresses your heroes will get stronger and you'll start getting attached to them. You'll start spending precious money on them to give them the best training and the best gear possible to increase their chances of survival...but nothing is guaranteed in Darkest Dungeon. All it takes is one or two randomly missed attacks for the enemy to gain the upper hand and start wreaking havoc on your precious heroes.Every dive into the dungeons is nerve-wracking and intense; you can prepare as much as you like, but there's always a degree of uncertainty that leaves you fearful with every dive.CONS of the game - well, even after all these years (this review is up to Colors of Madness DLC), this game is still TOO RNG. I'm aware that a degree of RNG is part of this game's charm, I understand. So let me explain. It's strange that your enemies have RESISTANCES to their WEAKNESS. This is a very weird development decision, in my opinion. A WEAKNESS should be just that - A WEAKNESS! At first a skeleton with ~10% blight resist (blight is their weakness) is manageable,  but at higher levels of play it gets like ~50% blight resist. What the??? Basically the WEAKNESS, the ONE THING YOU CAN RELY ON against a skeleton, is suddenly RNG? It's literally a COIN FLIP? This ""WEAKNESS RESISTANCE"" makes the higher levels feel bad to play. No amount of strategy will make up for an enemy having no weakness to exploit. You feel bad for losing against them, and then you don't feel good when you land a hit cause it's RNG and you just had your fingers crossed. Another example is the giant skeleton. Big, so he hits hard. Sure - that's fine. He's big, so he has PROTECT % (armor, basically)- that's fine, too. But at higher levels, this giant skeleton, who clearly is a slow, lumbering beast, suddenly has DODGE % (chance to EVADE an attack)? What??? Again, it feels bad. It's artificial difficulty. It makes any form of strategy feel bad because you're at the total mercy of the game. This has been an issue for YEARS now, so I take it they don't see this as an issue. The devs may not even be aware of this, or they think it adds flavor to the game. It doesn't.If they kept weaknesses as weaknesses, this game would've easily been a 9.Again, great game - it just has some glaring flaws during late game that make it hard to totally recommend.",joshbreviews

I almost didn't buy BF3 because the PS3 beta SUCKED so bad, but now I am SO GLAD I gave it a chance.  I've also noticed that many of the negative youtube reviews are based on beta experience only.    A little background- I never played the earlier Battlefield games, played MW2 a little bit, and sunk over 8 DAYS in Black Ops, so I compare BF3 to COD a lot here.  Also, if you are looking for a campaign review, look elsewhere because I haven't played it and probably won't.  My first impression of the graphics were 'meh'. In all fairness,  I guess all console graphics are underwhelming after coming fresh off of Uncharted 3 though.  But the more I played, the more I appreciated BF3....the lighting, the sun in the eyes, smoke, fog, rain, etc are all stellar.  I got killed once because I was just standing there in awe admiring the corpse of some poor camper.  I'd just blasted the back of his head and the blood was splattered against the rocks he was hiding behind in a level of detail unseen so far on the PS3.  Just beautiful.  After playing for nearly an hour I was questioning my purchase, but after 4 hours of deathmatch I can safely say the conversion from COD fanboy is complete!  If the early reports are true about MW3 not really upping the ante, then 6 months from now this will be the military shooter real players are playing.  The housewives and the kids will be left to duke it out on COD through their pink heart shaped reticle.  For better or worse, there isn't much customization here.  If you want to play dress up with your character like its a freakin Barbie doll I recommend the Uncharted3 experience...kill people with a sweet fedora and then do a dance.  I'm not really into that.  If you want to enter the closest thing ever to a real warzone then BF3 is the way to go.    Once the match begins is where BF3 really shines.  The sound is also incredible.  If I could rate it 11 in that category I would.  Everyone gives EA servers crap, but unlike BlackOps, I didn't get disconnected once, and experienced zero lag.   I was worried about 2 things on this game- that there would be too many campers and too many snipers.  Unless things change, neither has been an issue for me.  In fact, I'd say there is much more of both in Black Ops.  Based on what I'd heard about BF2, I was also worried that the maps would be too big and I'd have trouble finding the action.  No problem there- I had more action than Ron Jeremy.   A couple of times I got shot in the back immediately after spawning.  It also spawned me behind a solid enemy position once or twice & I got some cheap kills of my own.  95% of the time though,  spawning is a non-issue.   Overall, it was a welcome relief to not constantly be shot in the back as happened oh so many times in Black Ops.  Knife kills aren't as fluid as BLops, but look cooler.   Killcams are also not as good.  Much like the useless Uncharted 3 and Resistance 3 killcams, you ID the killer, but it doesn't really help you see where you went wrong or give away the killer's position as well as COD.  Another minor gripe is that I couldn't figure out how to easily leave the lobby.  I had no reason to, but if there had been a bunch of douchebags blasting their hiphop through the mics it would be nice to quickly back out and join another match.  Maybe this option is there and I'm just not familiar enough with the interface yet.",GreatBlumpkin

Not sure what they meant by ""rebuilding the game from the ground up"" because it is literally the same awful game we all played and walked away from 5 years ago.I'm an MMO vet, dating back to the mid-90s. I've played/beta tested pretty much every MMO worth mentioning. Let me just say that there is little to no improvement over the last version. First off, the game starts out by making you do the most mundane quests imaginable in the starter city. You are literally BEGGING for excitement at some point. Nevertheless, you will keep playing because you think ""surely it will get better"". Nope. It actually gets worse.The UI/HUD is a nightmare. Why you need so many options is beyond me. Second, you need a magnifying glass to read anything, even on my 55"" big screen. Oh, and the map?! Useless. Plus it's microscopic and can't be made fullscreen...Combat is just as bad. No fluidity. No fun. Just the worst.I wanted to like this game. I really did. But the fact is, it's a waste of time.

Paid reviews are the only answer here, as you can clearly see in the difference between REAL user reviews and the obviously fake ones. Anyone rating this game higher than a 5 or a 6 is a paid reviewer I promise.Anyway, this is a cash grab and a mediocre attempt at making back some of the money they lost during the first release. Nothing much has changed at all. It's still awful, just has a different name (sort of).No voice acting either, so I hope you like reading tiny text for hours on end. Immersion? Yeah right. Unless you are referring to being immersed in failure, in which case Square Enix has that in spades. Can you hear me all the way back there in 1996? This game will take you there I promise.Now mind you, I WANT to say something positive here. I'm not the kind of guy who writes purely bad reviews.

216190,Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,PC,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Very addicting game. I've been with Assassin's Creed since the first and loved the first two. Brotherhood was a bit too dry for me to actually finish and I didn't bother with Revelations. I couldn't get into ACIII because of its slow story progression and early game restrictions alongside with its unpolished control interface and certain game mechanics (like aiming). What makes this game great compared to the others is its less restrictive exploration which begins very early in the game. Naval travel is pretty good and the ship to ship combat is great (not the best but pretty damn good). I think what makes this game great is due to the fact that it really does not feel like Assassin's Creed, especially when your going around pillaging ships. Not to mention Edward Kenway isn't really an official assassin until close to the end of the game. He's just a pirate doing whatever it takes to make his fortune. There is a lot of repetition and the difficulty is average. The combat is not as brutal as AC3 but it satisfies.

The amount of enemy variety in the game should be applauded, with each new area you explore usually housing new enemy types that require new strategies to be adopted in order to overcome. Memorable bosses have become a staple of From Software games, and Bloodborne is no different. Boss types can be slow and crushingly strong, spell slingers, to lightning fast and able to catch you in a combo, with no 2 bosses feeing the same.All in all, I did not find this title as difficult as others in the From Software library due to my specific play style and preferences. Between the gorgeous world, grotesque and intriguing enemies, memorable bosses, and deep lore steeped in Lovecraftian influence, this game is a must play if you own a PS4.",adrewtoremember

It is worth to try out online too, because you can make a server or start a quick race with other people, and it runs smooth enough. Very quick tuning in this game.  I had a lot of fun in this game!What i don't like about this game: Career mode was a little bit boring, because i miss the old GT's when you got a car prize every event you completed. I missed these good old licenses too, i wanted more of that! The soundtrack (The menu and racing music) was not so good in this game like other GT's. The music gave you more an arcade-game feeling than a simulation game feeling... The weather and temperature on this game are totally misunderstandable, it stands for example it is a rainy day, but it is sunny when i am racing. There were too few night/weather change events, i wanted more of that. It is frustrating that almost every car sounds fake when gearing up. It sounds like i am gearing up a formula car when i'm driving a Mazda MX5 for example. Gran Turismo 4 sounded much more realistic with the transmission on a car.Anyways i recommend this game, it is really fun!",Andjelico

RockStar spent the better part of 5 years developing the concept for this game.With the expectations so high prior to it's release. This reviewer was honestly expecting a failure of a game.What I did not expect was a game to exceed the hype and create a game so large in scale that it creates a new standard for all open world games.The game focuses on three protagonists. Trevor. Michael and Franklin.Each of whom have different backgrounds and life situations. Who all stories intertwine and become a trio of anti-heroes who organise bank heists.Without delving too much into the characters. Rockstar do a fantastic job creating a basic prologue of each character do make each of them mildly interesting to the player.The interchangeable players is a nice touch. But this sacrifices deep storytelling of a single lead character.A small irk though. Graphically it is amazing. Among the best realism on the current gen. The simple control's stay true to the traditional style. Set in a reimagined Los Santos and Blaine County. This visual masterpiece is this franchise best release since San Andreas on PS2.My only problems with this game. Reused dialogue. Lack of in depth character development and at times it feels a little lacklustre but that is few and far and between.On the upside  Missions are fun. The Chemistry between Micheal and Trevor is hilarious. There is always something to do.This game is a new level of quality which will take some beating.,slipkornswitch

But even so, I have a baseball cap from the famous American baseball team, the New York Yankees. But going to what matters, will this MLB The Show 18 be higher than last year's version, which already had good reviews? From what I have seen and experienced, my answer is this:MLB The Show 18 - 9.5/10It is true that baseball isn't a very popular sport in Europe, i'm not a big fan either. But even so, I have a baseball cap from the famous American baseball team, the New York Yankees. But going to what matters, will this MLB The Show 18 be higher than last year's version, which already had good reviews? From what I have seen and experienced, my answer is this: no doubt.I liked the attitude of San Diego that dares to sting us with an introduction full of good moments and shows the reason of the North Americans to adore this sport. I will start talking about the news of this MLB The Show 18 in relation to the previous one. Nothing more than joining the useful to enjoyable. We have more options on player customization on Road to the Show, whether the real player or not, we have new camera angles, we have more player emotions and more fan reactions. The Road to the Show, in addition to the improvements in customization and now being more Role Playing Game, also received another addition. When we are going to create a new player, we have to choose an archetype, each with its limitations and benefits. The use of the in-game currency to improve the attributes of our character has been removed from this game. Now, to improve our character in this 2018 version, it's based on the success we're doing on the field and during training.Diamond Dynasty also had improvements. We now have a flexible program system in which we must choose the missions to play and in an attempt to obtain legendary cards and immortal legendary cards. Yes, you are correct, this game has more legendary cards than the previous one. The online has also been improved, although it still has a bit of lag, but it still doesn't compare to the 2017 version and I admit I had a good time in multiplayer. Unfortunately the online Franchise mode has been removed, but don't worry, the offline version is present in this MLB The Show 18.Now reaching the ball with the baseball bat is easier and the physics of the ball are better. The animations of the audience and the players have also been given extra attention and the stadiums are excellent. The truth is that the game is difficult for those who understand half or less than that, the rules of baseball.Retro Mode and Home Run Derby are also present. Home Run Derby is a tournament of, well, Home Runs and retro mode is basically meant to delight those who love to see and experience nostalgia for baseball games of yesteryear. The soundtrack is also on point; bands like Daft Punk or Imagine Dragons are present in this game. Anyway, just good things in this MLB The Show 18.In short, the SIE San Diego Studio in what concerns baseball games, really knows pruning. Inevitably this MLB The Show 18 is a recommended product for baseball fans. I even started watching baseball a bit differently after playing this title.",ShadowPeter

I bought it for full price when it came out and excitedly installed it and was very quickly disappointed. I think the Battlefield games are much better in many ways like sound, graphics, controls feel, performance, more sandbox-like, etc etc. There are a bunch of retail copies of this game at a local retailer for $5 and they've been sitting there for over six months at that price and not selling. Don't pay more than $10 for it. It just isn't worth it. Get Battlefield 2 and install Project Reality if you want hardcore objectives-based FPS online game. Alternatively, go with BF: Bad Company 2 for a more accessible arcade FPS online game.",JBob

NowOn receiving this game I thought it was fantastic Rpg/Adventure with great Action. I was really hoping to enjoy this game, BUT!, am now discovering how actually bland and simplistic this game is - esp once your about 7hrs inn!!I was hoping KoA:R would have varied quests and many options/decision paths/discoveries as described and mentioned by the makers before the games release!!!!.. Now with 14hrs of game play(approx); all I've been doing is bashing the attack button, slaying creatures for the many samey side-quests, or, simply fetching mostly useless item(s) that still involve slaying everything!!!. While combat seems cool and engaging at first, it's nothing more then a series one button presses and occasional block pausing. You can easily take on groups of 4-7 guys with ease!! EVEN ON HARD LEVEL!!..This does start to drag at times, as it doesn't really require anything, just attack, attack, attack!. You walk a few steps before you have to repeat the same action attacking everything in your way, but, without any real challenge, as enemies do fall fairly easily. I actually just run past them now!...After a few hours play the gameplay with KoA:R doesstart to become action repetitive, actually very repetitive!!! . This is made worse as KoA:R lacks  challenge, or required skill, or even discovering enemy weak-points, that can make fighting more varied and interesting as battles come far to often. I also found one attack technique seems to beatsall (so-far!) - the many attacking options are there, but, are not , actually required.I do find it rather stupid, for a game of this sort, that annoyingly, you are stuck to the ground!! You can't jump freely or over anything!.  Because of this stupidity you are forced to walk around everything just to reach a place you can see just a few steps away, but can't, as its blocked by a small rock, fence, water, edge, lake..etc; forcing you to find a longer route. You can't even fall/step-off the edge(unless its at a very limited fixed game design place)!!!!...The world, while attractive and fairly varied, it is rather flat as you don't reach high places, no hills, no mountains, no ladders, no reaching high peaks - everything is on ground floor! This is also not a true open world game in the sense of Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout games, as you are funnelled into a one direction with many area architectural designs within the game world fairly similar - though painted with different textures !The story isn't very engrossing at present (14hrs) and seems fairly generic so-far. Also there seems to be NO consequences to the actions you make!! I slaughtered a whole village, yet no-one cared! this destroys feeling for a living game world. There isn't much activity gong onn in the villages, and can be quiet and empty in many areas too (so-far!). Cut scenes are poor, your character just stands staring of into the distance not reacting to anything; as do other characteres!!. Lip sync is bad too! like a badly dubbed movie.I will continue to play to the end, but it feels I'm using my thumb to bash buttons more then making deep choices, figuring out things, making moral choices that effect game direction, or searching for meaningful items/loots to help progress (everything is just thrown at you without ant real discovering!).  With the streamlined and generic Rpg that is rather simplified has taken away the depth of an involving Rpg and has made it more a arcade large Hack n Slash game - without depth!!!",musicgamer

Dismissing the campy elements of the original, it increases the creep factor with new environments and intense standoffs. Unlike the recent games in the series, this is a slow-paced horror title. A quick death can occur in an instant due to booby trapped rooms. You may also unknowingly walk into a room featuring a boss that can quickly kill you. It is a game that encourages players to constantly save due to its trial-and-error nature.Nevertheless, this is a classic that set the standard for the genre. It plays out differently depending on which character you choose (Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield), so it is worth playing through twice.

Much like many of its contemporaries it gets half the job astoundily well done--the artsy one--but doesn't quite nail the core gameplay content that smartly.On the bright side there's plenty to be proud of: presentation overall is plain superb--both music and graphics are a testimony of a very cohesive art direction--and everything sums up nicely to serve the plot--or at least the philosophic dialogue it proposes if we can't agree it has a proper plot.On the other hand the developers couldn't help restricting the player's resources as if it was a classic hardcore game. Physics here are way too loose to ask the player the precision and swiftness the levels so constantly demand, goo balls are often too limited in number and as they grow in variety it gets tougher to pick the right one from the crowd, and checkpoints (despite the smart ""undo"" concept) work poorly. (Using OCDs for triggering Achievements sits on top of that as well.)The game sometimes try to make up for those frustration moments by offering alternate paths in the maps but they're often useless since it eventually forces you to get back to the avoided levels before allowing you to progress anyway.World of Goo weights in the ""games as art"" debate but does so by improving the usual external assets related to that instead of improving interactivity--the main feature that makes the medium unique for exploring new forms of art.",julianozuca

Despite the setting and references to Origins, it is more of a redesign of the series, a new start, with too many elements cut and pasted from Mass Effect 2. This isn't a completely bad thing, but it appeals to an entirely different audience and might leave fans of the original very angry and frustrated. From an oversimplified inventory system to sped up gameplay mechanics, it leaves little room for strategy and requires too much button mashing. While the action-rpg fan in me was still ok with some of the new changes, the game truly suffers from its bland characters. Fantasy stereotypes that are obnoxious and annoying, especially the emo elves whose whining never stops echoing in the big city of Kirkwall. Now understand that this is being compared to DA:Origins, a game that had characters you really cared about until the very end. So as a whole, Dragon Age II is still solid compared to other rpgs, it's just not comparable to its predecessor.  Graphically, the game is much sharper with a smoother frame rate, but it suffers from poor, repetitive level design. For the 30 + hours of gameplay, you will feel like you've never left the surroundings from the first few hours of the game. Despite my heavy criticism, this is still a fun action-rpg. It's obvious that the developers worked with an unreasonable deadline but my hopes are high for Dragon Age III. Would I recommend this? If you have played Origins, I would recommend this as a small appetizer for DA III, but just make sure you lower you expectations. For anyone else, I'd highly recommend the fantastic DAL Origins first and wait till this finds its way into the bargain bin.",Salamunic

105051,Pillars of Eternity,PC,5,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        PoE is a difficult title to review.It claims to be a spiritual successor to old infinity engine games but that couldn't be further from the truth. The truth is that it doesn't compare to Baldur's Gate series on any possible level. As a standalone, isometric RPG, it is okay (some signs of brilliance here and there) but the developers are claiming it is a BG successor, so I will review it as BG successor.Story: bland, run-of-the-mill story with interesting moments connected through hours of boredom. Nothing special. Just run to a guy who can help you - oh, he's dead - run to the next guy - oh, he's dead too - run to the next guy - oh, he dies too - find final boss - kill final boss. Save a few exceptions basically no character development at all.Graphics: good, albeit generic. Some spell effects are quite pretty.Music: oh please don't get me started on this one... Obsidian didn't realize that 50% of BG epicness was music. One boring combat track for the entire game really just doesn't cut it, guys.Combat system: clunky and tiresome. Absolutely no automatic AI at all (even BG 1 had AI scripts for those who didn't want to micro manage every single member of the party) - they don't even auto attack by themselves. Waves and waves of the same, generic combat sequences. And the best part - when you complete Bestiary entry for an enemy, you STOP earning XP for that enemy kills. Oh, yes, Obsidian, we completionists really want to get punished for playing our way. Literally go re-play Fallout 1&2 right now to see how non-combat choices should be implemented without gimping combat-oriented approaches.RPG system: basically an altered version of DnD 4e. Setting aside the fact that 3e would be far superior, absence of any immunity stats is just hilarious. Dragons killed by fireballs, frightened spectres, oozes slipping to the ground from local version of Grease spell, and so on and on and on. Innovative? Maybe. Immersive and intuitive? Nope. Changes for the sake of changes, not for the sake of system improvement or logic.Companions: few glimpses of good writing here and there (Durance and Sagani), otherwise little more than generic drones standing in combat drooling, waiting for you to right click on the enemy.All in all, very poor example of classic CRPG games' successor. This game wants to look ""old school"" so badly but fails to deliver. It is nothing like the old IE games. It wasn't developed by people who loved the old DnD games.",BlueBangkok

I played all the way through Persona 3 FES, and I loved the game. Sure, it had it's flaws, but it didn't stop me from relating to and loving all of the relatable and loving characters. Persona 4 has taken my standards and raised them a few bars, because it's even better than P3 in almost every way. The characters are even more relatable, the game's setting being out in the countryside in a town with a very similar feel to the one that I grew up in; the battlesystem has been tweaked to make up for the mistakes that the AI often made in P3 by giving you the option to control your allies yourself; the storyline is much less cliche than P3; the voice acting as a whole seems much more natural (except for Chie, who sounds ten years older than she should); and the symbolism the game presents to the gamer playing it made my head spin a little after the first major boss battle. If I were to complain about something, it would be that some of the voices can be grating at times, and that there is so little voice acting in the Social Link conversations. There's barely a ""Hey!"" or a ""Let's go!"" before the silent text continues. I think that if they're going to voice parts of the Social Links, then they should go all out and voice them entirely. In addition, in the first dungeon, my teammates kept getting stuck behind the open doors whenever I would leave a room to continue down a given hallway. Not the most world-ending of annoyances, but it did waste a valuable five seconds each time. All in all, if I had to choose one word for Persona 4, it would be ""fresh.""

148441,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings,PC,10,"Witcher 2 is easily the best cRPG since the great classics like Fallout 1/2 or Planescape:Torment.

There may be games which have more technologically sophisticated rendering engines but I doubt they haveWitcher 2 is easily the best cRPG since the great classics like Fallout 1/2 or Planescape:Torment. The game developed upon its predecessor and carried over all its merits and improved all its faults. The most obvious thing when you see the game is that it's absolutely beautiful. There may be games which have more technologically sophisticated rendering engines but I doubt they have anywhere as good art direction. My only complaint is that the architecture was better in W1. Still, Witcher 2 looks gorgeous. The story is the central and most important feature of the game. And it's also one of the greatest stories ever told on a computer screen. The player has a wide degree of control over how it develops: your choices do matter. Unlike in most rpg games, the story actually branches, the choices aren't only flavour,where only the colour of your allies' uniforms depends on what you select. This is the most ambitious take on incorporating choice and consequence in the history of cRPGs. There are even locations that are only accessible in a specific branch of the story. I really hope that this becomes a new standard for RPGs.The interaction with the gameworld is done really nicely. This is an Action RPG, so the combat is quite dynamic and, on ""hard"" difficulty it requires both manual and tactical skills. The game can be pretty hard and require some flexibility, which only adds to the satisfaction of beating a tough opponent. Aside from combat, most of the time you'll be talking to people. The dialogues are done Mass-Effect-style, where you only choose a short version of the dialogue. This is handled better than in ME with no insta-win blue/red option and the short versions actually do correspond with what the protagonist will say. However, the conversation animations aren't as good as in ME, which is a shame, since dialogue is much more important and meaningful in The Witcher. The dialogues are well-written and the characters are memorable. You will also play some mini-games: fist fighting, armwrestling and dice poker, which are done quite well. The quests in the game are really varied, with no real fed-ex quests, often offering surprising twists, multiple solutions and multiple outcomes. And these translate into the story taking you into different directions.You will also be travelling a lot, but not as much as in TW1, thankfully. The gameworld lives and breathes and oozes atmoshpere. It's easily the best attempt at creating an illusion of a living society in an RPG.Your character, Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer, can develop in 3 ways: as a swordmaster, as an alchemist or as a magician. You will always a remain a witcher - a sword fighting mutant, but depending on which way you want to develop, the gameplay will be slightly different.The game is not perfect: there are minor glitches and it may be difficult for casual players.  But even so Witcher 2 stomps its contemporary competition into the ground. BioWare, Obsidian and Bethesda should all watch and learn, since this is a new quality for this genre.",dzizass

Tetris Party is theFirst, a warning to anyone who is interested in picking up a Tetris game: if you have a Wii and an internet connection, get this game instead of the Deluxe version.  I haven't played Deluxe, but based on what I have gathered from multiple sources, the Deluxe version simply contains a few extras and is being sold for more than twice the price.  Now, on to the review.  Tetris Party is the most complete version of Tetris that I am aware of.  Several different game modes are available aside from the standard marathon, all of which I find fun except for Stage Racer.  The Shadow mode adds a whole lot of replay value due to its relatively high number of stages, and I know people who do not enjoy Tetris (shocker!) and were still massively entertained by Shadow.  Co-op is a very logical multiplayer variant, but once more difficult levels are reached, chaos ensues.  Not that chaos is a bad thing - hectic situations in Co-op have been some of my favorite moments playing Tetris party.  The standard versus mode is intact, and users have the option to play with items on or leave them turned off.  Note that ""garbage,"" the junk lines you send opponents with bigger line clears, cannot be turned off.  Many Tetris beginners may find this to be a disappointment at first, but the reason this option was omitted should become clear rather quickly.  Playing without garbage would lead to matches that last far too long, especially for anyone who has already been eliminated.  Also, for people stuck with friends who are far more skilled at Tetris, a practice mode is available so that they can keep playing while their friends duke it out.  Aside from the boring Stage Racer mode, the only con I can come up with is that the music is mostly bland.  You are given the option to turn it off, however, so you can simply play music you prefer from a laptop or something like that.  All in all, I think there is by far enough content and entertainment value in Tetris Party to make it well worth the $12 entry fee.",p337

First off this game was rushed because they had a good final product and then had it all thrown out because they thought it was too much like Assassins' Creed. So then they started over and rushed this garbage game out. To start, my brother and I both finished this entire game in one few hour sitting, each in the same day on the hardest difficulty. That's right. This game is good for about 4 hours of entertainment on the toughest difficulty. The gameplay has turned fisher from a modern day ninja into a Jason Borne on crack. The normally slow moving and strategic stealth is replaced by movements and animations that are so unbelievably fast that they are comical at times.The engine is dumbed down compared to the previous installments. Despite being labeled a stealth game you cannot move bodies.. bodies still alert the guards regardless. And even though there are less stealth abilities compared to the last game, they've upped the penalty for being spotted on some missions. If you are so much as spotted in some levels the game ends. The only kind of people that this game should appeal to is people that have never touched a controller in their life. The massive ad campaign was the only thing that saved the sales on this monstrous garbage. 30% of the ubisoft forum crowd canceled their preorders after just playing the demo. I could write a six page essay on all the things wrong with this game, but I'd rather not. Hopefully I've saved people some money with this.

114223,Mass Effect 3,PC,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I'd like to start by suggesting that people ignore all of the knee-jerk 0 or 1 score reviews given to this game, many of which are being written by people who admittedly haven't even played it.  Mass Effect 3 is not a bad game, it's not even a mediocre game.  It is a FANTASTIC game with an admittedly subpar and unsatisfying ending, and a large number of people are losing sight of the context because of their (understandable) attachment to the series as a whole.To begin, let me state my biggest pros and cons from the previous two games:Mass Effect 1:Pros: Fantastic, engaging, compelling story with interesting characters and a rich background.Cons: Clunky mechanics and gameplayMass Effect 2:Pros: Vastly improved gameplay mechanics, well-developed character-oriented storiesCons: Main storyline is underdeveloped in comparison to all the time you spend on the individual character stories, RPG customization elements severely dumbed downNow let me say what Mass Effect 3 did about the problems in the previous games, first regarding the gameplay mechanics and the RPG customization elements:The gameplay in ME3 is the best in the series by far.  While the cover controls are somewhat clunky at first, they aren't difficult to get used to.  ME2 was absurdly easy even on the hardest difficulties, and there was very little variation in enemy tactics, while ME3 is far more challenging and presents much more differences between the tactics and abilities of different enemies.The RPG elements of ME3 are far better than either of the previous two installations of the series.  Instead of having an enormous, confusing pile of weapons and equipment with no easy way to sort(ME1), or having almost no choices to make whatsoever because each new item you get is a clear upgrade over the last(ME2), you get a system of interchangeable weapons with varying stats, each suiting different preferences, and each can be modified further to allow everyone to create a customized setup that suits their playstyle.  Instead of having tons of skill points to split among tiny incremental updates to two dozen skills(ME1), or having a meager set of abilities with only four ranks and one minor specialization each(ME2), you now have a healthy mix of both active and passive abilities, with each giving three opportunities for further specialization, allowing two people playing the same character class to end up with drastically different abilities.Now, to the most important part of Mass Effect, the story.  I'll try to keep the spoilers as generic as possible.  ME3 made two big improvements over ME2 in this regard.  First, it made the story drive the game again like ME1, instead of the characters like ME2.  Second, it managed to make everything feel connected to a larger purpose.  Everything you do in ME3, even down to the most seemingly menial tasks, all has a feeling of being part of the greater aim of preparing the galaxy for war.  I did every side mission I could find while I was playing ME3 and never once did I feel like I was doing something that felt out of place in my effort to prepare the galaxy to fight the Reapers.  Within the main story missions, the writing is great, the characters are compelling, and there are far more choices that leave you stuck thinking about a morally gray outcome than many of the more black-and-white choices of the previous games.  I know many people are upset at the fact that many ME2 characters get little more than a short token appearance, and some of them die in unavoidable fashion, but I think these people are missing the point that A) all of them could have died in ME2 so there's no way they could all be written into major roles, and B) part of the impact of ME3 is showing that death is an unavoidable consequence of war.  On the whole I found the main storyline to be exciting, compelling, and well worth the price of admission.My gripes with Mass Effect 3, like many others, regard the ending.  First of all, I think the segment of the game on Earth is much too short.  For the amount of time we spent building these assets I expected a bigger and more complex finale, which is one area where ME2 excelled by breaking up the final mission into the various segments with different goals.  The finale on the citadel, while it does bring closure to the storyline, is unsatisfying mainly for its lack of connection to all the choices you made previously.  The player is left to imagine the ramifications of Shepard's last choice and legacy of other decisions but doesn't get any of the exposition we were all hoping for.  The war assets also have much too little an effect at the very end.What it comes down to is that Bioware made an incredible game that loses its coherence in the final hours.  I'd give the first 90% a 9.5/10 and the ending a 5/10, and I'm hoping that Bioware responds to the criticism and does right by their fans, because this game, and this series as a whole, deserve it.",Iconix

Whistles blowing as you charge the enemy, the screams of the dying, things exploding and collapsing left and rights, bullets whizzing past.

94474,Deus Ex: Human Revolution,PC,8,"Overall, a pretty decent game if you play it at least as a quasi-stealth approach.PROS -Lots of weapons to choose from (or none at all if you want to do entirely melee takedowns).

Augmentations do let you choose which style of play fits you better, and they are sparse enoughOverall, a pretty decent game if you play it at least as a quasi-stealth approach.PROS -Lots of weapons to choose from (or none at all if you want to do entirely melee takedowns).  The movement and the combat is fluid enough that there is no real awkwardness in either sneaking or fighting.  Augmentations do let you choose which style of play fits you better, and they are sparse enough that you actually do have to make choices about which ones you want; although if you play total stealth and get all the bonuses for not being seen, by the end of the game you will have most things.  The story isn't bad, and fleshes out the back story of the first game since this takes place before it.  There are a few character references and names and such that hint at things in the first game.CONS-   If you do play for stealth you basically don't use any weapons except in boss fights and that's too bad because some of them are interesting enough.  The boss fights are EXTREMELY out of place in the game, especially if you go a stealth route, though they aren't too tough, especially if you carry a spare heavy weapon, and a stun gun.  The last ""boss fight"" and really the last entire level was very anti climactic.  Hacking is way too over used, there are literally 50-100 things in every area that can be hacked... and the way the augmentations are broken out to improve hacking just requires way too many points to be good at it (unless you play total stealth then you have more than enough).  The chinese city was WAY too large and convoluted to navigate well, even after being there repeatedly in the game and overall spending a few hours there.  The facial animations, and movement in general (at the very least for the half a dozen characters you get up close and have important conversations with) should have been a lot better, they look a bit dated and wooden.  The voice acting is just... off.  Maybe because the animations don't show emotion well, or maybe because the particular voices they chose just didn't work, i'm not sure.  If you play with quasi-stealth and don't care about the stealth bonuses, it is not terribly difficult to kill everything and just hide when they come for you and repeat.  As a straight shooting game it would be far less entertaining than trying for full stealth, and would probably be fairly easy and tedious.Overall I actually found it a reasonable successor to the original, and certainly better than invisible war by far.  This game does emphasize the stealth a little more than the original that merely offered it as an attractive choice, however you certainly don't have to play as stealth and can brute force it.  The story line isn't quite as complex, but was reasonably entertaining if not partially predictable.  I am usually the first to hate games that are also released on console because of them being (dumbed down) but really I don't think this game suffered from that nearly as much as people claim.  Honestly any negativity from fans of the original is probably from people who haven't played the original in a while and remember it being more than it was.  There was more freedom, and the story was a little better in the original, but a lot of the basic game elements and premises are still here, and this game embraces it's own kind of exploration with the cities that the original really didn't have as much except in wan chai.",ErebusMaligan

Apart from rather bad graphics, which were mostly down to an old engine, aging hardware, and disc limitations of the time, San Andreas would score high on the charts of any generic rating system. It took the already well established, if slightly repetitive formula of it's predecessor, Vice City, and expanded, refreshed, and improved every aspect.

This left some core elements some gamers would dislike, but the masses, the critics, and myself, couldn't get enough of the best offering the GTA series had to offer. Storyline, audio, presentation, all packaged into a game where, with a little progression, you could unlock many more locations, vehicles, weapons, and gameplay elements (Who could forget the jetpack in all it's obscure glory?) than many other games of the time, made GTA one of the best games ever developed for the PS2 system.

Since you're actually controlling the character, the horror produced by games always beat the most intense movie for me. Since RE:1 few games have recreated that level of dread. Outlast and Layers of Fear did great jobs of creating that same experience. However, they both had much smaller budgets than RE7. So Capcom has made a highly polished gem of horror and fear. They have created a game that is difficult but not unfair with a great plot and fun play mechanics. The fact that your character is not a special forces soldier or even a cop, means that you spend as much time hiding and planning your next move, as you do shooting or hacking at the enemy. Also, the relate-ability of the character to non-combat trained people adds to sense of fear through familiarity. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 10/10 is some of the boss battles didn't fit with the feeling and theme of the overall game.",veritas2884

While it may not be the genre defining title, I think Battlefield could definitely snatch the crown in it's next iteration if EA and DICE keep at it with the same ferocity. Despite how wonderful the game is overall, there are two big, glaring tarnishes on it. The first is campaign. I mean seriously, did no one at DICE say ""Hey, campaign really sucks. How can we make it better?"". Besides the story not making too much sense (and taking a huge turn out to left field at the end) there's still a couple of annoying glitches that persist from BC2, the most annoying being that enemy AI focus the majority of their fire on you and they see you from just about everywhere. What's the point of hiding behind a bush, or in a cloud of smoke when the enemy somehow knows you're there and will proceed to fill your digital body with lead. The second tarnish is the in-browser game launching system Battlelog. I appreciate the attempt at ingenuity and attempting something new, but it just doesn't feel right. I can't even change my in-game setting unless I'm actually in a game (""hey, can you guys not kill me 'til I fix my key bindings?"")

And to people complaining about multiplayer. Please, please, PLEASE refer to the first two Ratchet and Clank games, every platforming Mario game (Besides the Mario Bros. Arcade game), Jak (2 and 3) and Daxter, AND every Sonic-related platform game. No Multiplayer didn't stop them from becoming great replayable games, now did they?

156587,Batman: Arkham Knight,PlayStation4,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Note: my actual rating for this one would probably be around 7.7First thing's first, the aspect that practically makes or breaks the game for you.  The Batmobile. I myself share a love-hate relationship with it. Let me put it this way, the Batmobile, as a gameplay aspect, is pretty damn cool. Racing through Gotham in the fast paced crime chasing vehicle through an open world. However, as cool as it is, it's undeniably shoved down your throat. To clarify, the Batmobile is a mode of transport, so why the hell am I using it for everything else as well? Quest, puzzles, indoors, outdoors, boss battles. Eventually, it got to the point where I found myself avoiding use of the batmobile as much as possible because I just wanted to be Batman.  Not to mention, the tank drones and helicopters are gathered in hordes to force the player to be use the batmobile more often. Not only is that annoying in terms of taking choice away from the player, it's annoying in that it takes away the essence of being Batman, the master strategist, hand to hand master, with a utility belt full of awesome crap, who always wins via his wit.Really, that's what the Arkham games thrived on, capturing the essence of being the feared Dark knight.Does this game do that?When you're playing as Batman, yes, since not much has changed in terms of Batman's gameplay, I'll list the changes that really stuck out. The new Fear Multi Takedown REALLY captures that feeling of being Batman, jumping out of nowhere to take out one crook then taking out the other while he's still too shocked to attack.In terms of writing and what not, Batman is very much himself, breaking bones, solving mysteries with high tech, pushing onward no matter how bad the odds are.In terms of the sidequests, I was taken by surprise by a lot of the villains. Notably Man-Bat, and Pyg were ones I didn't expect. Nightwing showing up was great too, though he didn't really get enough of a role as he should.  Honestly, a lot of characters you'd hope would be in there were either absent or just plain cameos.As for the graphics, awesome.As for the boss battles, horrid.As for the story... as a comic book fan, let me put it this way, for the most part it's damn good, but it felt tainted by ghost-writing from Jeph loeb.Notably, there are parts where everything just feels... forced. Batman neutralizing the blast, seemingly giving his life, only for the batmobile to save him at the last second. The situation where the cowl is removed is the exact kind of situation where Batman is known for turning the tide last second. Arkham Knight's identity being obvious, he's basically just saying everything he said AFTER he was revealed to be Red Hood in the comics . In fact, now that I think about it. The Arkham Knight himself was pretty much unnecessary to the story, except to shoehorn in a more powerful foe. Especially considering the highlights of the original Knightfall arc were what happened AFTER the Bat was broken, with the then new criminal Bane, and Bruce's replacement going murderous. The most entertaining parts of the story are against Scarecrow, who made for quite the antagonist on his own. I also loved Joker in this one, even from the grave still managing to cause chaos and torment everyoneIn the end, the game could have easily been a 9 for me, ironically though, a lot of Arkham Knight's flaws came not from what it didn't do, but what it did. The Batmobile may have been awesome, but there were times where I wanted to be Batman, the militia may have been formidable, but they not only took away exploration, but in doing so took away the player's ability to be a fearsome creature of the night by limiting the number of ways to tackle the situation.  There is a sidequest to lessen the militia presence, however, so it really depends on how willing you are to do said sidequest.Again, Arkham Knight is a great game, but there is a lot of crap you have to be willing to tolerate in order to get to the parts that make it great.",CFCValuemeal

She's beautiful, and I feel that it's really all very sad, but in Utulik personally I spent no more than two hours for sure. There is, for example, Dubai - primary location, and a set of GARM, but at these locations, we conduct mizirnye amount of time.The gameplay has not changed - no problem with it, the more we have a new emplty, a classy way. Shooting has improved, but because of an optimization I was not very comfortable to shoot, so I went mostly stealth. It's interesting, because the locations in Deus Ex tiered, with different passages, there's more than one entrance and exit. I think the game design was even better.Human Revolution carries Mankind Divided on the subject. What I was doing in this part? I played 20 hours, but I don't know what took me so long. Remember what we did in Human Revolution, there was more locations, we've been a very long time. I felt the history, the scale of events, but even the episode with the crazy augs worth. Nothing of the kind in Mankind Divided, no! In the second part the plot is very weak, the scale is not. We mostly sit in Prague and do stuff. But the most disappointing is the plot. The boss is just aug man?! And that's it?! So simple?! Well, excuse me, in the first part we struggled with a mega computer, and now with a seemingly ordinary boss. The feeling has passed half of the game where the second half? It is noticeable that the game was cut. There are many questions, and chief among them is Adam Jensen it's the same or not?In the end, it is better to undergo Human Revolution - she didn't need a sequel.

Now that that's out of the way:This is a really fun game. An open-world sandbox with an added element of open-world elements through the hacking mechanism, which I must admit is far more fluid than I had anticipated. I will take off a point though because there's no driveable helicopters or aircrafts in general, which feels sort of limiting at times. It does make sense too however with how some parts of the game are structured, if you could just fly you wouldn't bother to solve half the puzzles within the game that require you to vault around, especially the CTOS Towers.There are plenty of weapons, all fit nicely on a radial wheel and are categorized with added secondaries like frags and IEDs. You can craft on the go anytime which is also nice, though unrealistic. But for the sake of convenience and gaming-practicality, its a good mechanism that shouldn't and doesn't conform to reality.The campaign is very lengthy and nice with lots of drama, tragedy, etc and there are also plenty of optional side activities that are not necessary but are rewarding. I got this game the day after release date, and I'm still having fun playing it. Also there is a season pass I did not get yet, but I'm sure that adds even more to the content. I did get it on the PS4 however so I did get some bonus missions which were quite fun too. There's also a great variety of online segments to even further the amount of fun you can have and adds a level of competitive play.To me, it was a great game, and worth every dollar I spent on it.

I, myself, have both consoles so I have no reason to blast games on either.Now, on to my GoW4 thoughts. As far as the story goes: While it's short, it's my favorite in the series. It's funny, and action packed. I just hope that they can make 5 longer. There is so much variety that they introduce in the campaign that they really can make it longer.As far as gameplay goes... it's tight. This is a Gears game fo sho. I was worried, what with the new studio taking over. My worries are gone. This feels just as good as the first time I played GoW1. I would give it a 9 only because the story should really be a 10-12 hour length. But its just over 6 and a half hours. I'm giving this a 10 just to counter all the fanboy reviews.As far as transitioning to the new characters from the old. Think of Star Wars episode 7 and how it was done there. Masterfully passing the torch.The multiplayer is a blast as well. New modes, familiar settings. Bring on the hours of fun!",MrFlankster

231906,Age of Empires,PC,9,"I first played this game when I was 6-7 years old; it was in 1997-98. Boy, was this game addicting, and fun, and awesome.

Yet for some reason, I always come back and try them again, and no one was influencing me on this. I always come back, feeling that maybe I I try it again and learn my mistakes, I'll be able to win it. That was my approach at each stage when I was a kid.As an adult, I was able to solve more battle problems easily. Yet, the game was still fun as hell. Sure, the graphics of this game isn't as beautiful as the nowadays. (what can you expect from a game in 1997 be compared to 2016). But in their time, their effects were considered great; it's still beautiful even now (just looks old, that's all). While the effects/CGI is debatable, the key is the game's content and strategy. Playing through this game teaches you and helps you develop a strategic mind, esp. to young children like I was when I first played them. Another good thing is their mode of difficulty: changing levels would change the A.I.'s intelligence level you're combating against, and that's vital for a real-time strategy game. You'd need that in order to develop your mind well, and the earlier you start it the better.Another good thing about this game is the history education. At every battle, there's a mission objective, hints, and history about them. I've fact-checked their histories, and (unless I'm wrong) none of them are BS. What ever history you read, you're safe to absorb them and be convinced that they're true. Ages of Empires is not only educational in developing a smart, strategic mind for young children, but also good (and maybe interesting) history lessons.",MIke_Levin

If it was a completely different Star Wars game it probably would have a better place in my heart but because it failed to live up to the expectations of its predecessor it will forever be doomed to sub-par. But even disregarding those failed expectations the game is simply average. Combat The melee combat is automaticKOTOR 2 has the misfortune of being named after an outstanding game. If it was a completely different Star Wars game it probably would have a better place in my heart but because it failed to live up to the expectations of its predecessor it will forever be doomed to sub-par. But even disregarding those failed expectations the game is simply average. Combat The melee combat is automatic and aside from occasional force spells is not very engrossing. The force spells are interesting and Force Lightning is always a blast but the melee feels like it could be done without you. If you started fighting and went to make a cup of tea the game might automatically win the fight for you before the kettle dings. You are really only needed for the more difficult fights and to move your characters from one encounter to the next. The main satisfaction is derived from waving around lightsabers.DialogueThere is enough dialogue to fill a book the size of War and Peace or a washer manual but instead of a plethora of well defined characters like Tolsky's masterpiece you find yourself talking to a washer manual with as much character as the soapy water within it. In the beginning there is plenty of people to meet but eventually you can predict what a characters next plot point will be 10 hours before it happens. I called the antagonist from the moment I met them and it was just a matter of time before my predictions were confirmed by their betrayal.StoryIn KOTOR you are a Sith Lord. In KOTOR 2 you are an old soldier. Why does the story need to exist? Who are you saving? What is your motivation? Why cant I just wave my lightsaber around for 20 hours? All these questions are unfortunately left unanswered and even unacknowledged. The plot is simply a device to move the character from one lightsaber battle to the next. I think the game wanted a character that anyone could relate to, a person with no outstanding qualities or past accomplishments that the player could then mold into an ultimate bad-ass. But there is no quest to save the galaxy or even defeat someone who is remotely capable of destroying a planet. You are simply a nobody who is trapped in the story of a nobody.In conclusion the only selling point of this game is the lightsabers. If you want to fantasize about yourself holding with a glowing hot stick then go for this game and skip all the dialogue and character interaction. But if you are looking for an engrossing and interactive game that will enhance your appreciation of the Star Wars universe then look elsewhere.",Parvarteshwar

The jokes get old, and it negatively effects the main plot....since the main plot is based around the goofiness, which in my opinion is stupid.

Telltale games also over sell this part of the game. In the first episode (for example) I could make two choices on who to save in a crisis. The first choice had no effect on the outcome (same person died both time) and the choice of the second choice turned to have very little effect as the character saved didn't have any ""air time"" in the 2nd episode and disappeared in episode 3. I can understand why Telltale Games does this because they feel that it would be too much work to make different graphical sequences with different characters and choices. But it ruins the feeling of me making choices.Similarly the choices I make as a survivor is just for show. It's a point and click adventure. When asked to solve tasks like distributing food (scarce) the best way  it's a social game and not a real dilemma. In other words, the performance for the characters left hungry isn't affected, which is why it's easy to avoid giving food to oneself.Overall an average game for me.

And, let me tell you this, it was the right decision.The game's art style is a bit darker than before, and the story is a bit more straightforward than Rekka no Ken's story was. The cast of characters has also been reduced, allowing for a deeper view on each character this time around. Gameplay wise, this game plays exactly like it's predecessor. The only notable differences are special class skills that some classes inhabit, and, most importantly, the world map. The world map feature allows the player to visit shops freely after clearing a certain chapter, and it also grants access to what most people would call training grounds: The Tower of Valni. It allows the player to go through it over and over, thus training your units. This can be used to make the game easier, or to level up characters post-story. Concerning difficulty, this game should be a good one for beginners, as it is a bit easier than other Fire Emblems, not only but also thanks to the Tower of Valni mentioned earlier. The replayability is, as one would expect knowing the franchise, very high. Not only can you continue playing after beating the story (to unlock certain characters, for example), but there are also two main routes to follow the story on. One has to play the game at least twice to get to enjoy all chapters, which could tick some people off, but shouldn't be a big deal, as this game is very addicting.To conclude, the game is one of the best in the franchise, and one of the best games for the system as well. It manages to be absolutely ""Fire Emblem"" while adding some spice with some small changes and attracting new players that are easily frustrated by the other installment(s).

Though many people will find obtaining them tedious (and if you're like me, you may have even passed through the game once, without ever realizing that there were stars to be collected). The way that it brings the full story into scope, in addition to the challenge they offer in trying to find & get all 8 makes Braid something totally unlike any other game, and well worth my $15.",PierceA

Navigating around obstacles (inc. other traffic) is not a challenge.The story is boring enough to not merit discussion.Curiously for a game with several standing collection quests, the world is technically well-created but lacks character & exudes a sense of artifice. Alive but vegetative. Exploring it is unrewarding even with the forced gameplay perks.On the plus side the PC version is well-optimized. Downside: the controls are awkward, even when you plug in a gamepad.

82087,Fallout 3,PC,5," Oh man. Talk about overrated. Reviewers see amazing graphics and suddenly its the ""game of the year."" There's a huge number of problems with this game, and that's not because of bugs. First of all, the main quest is horribly written, and, unlike Oblivion, you can't continue playing after it (although PC Gamer's editor still seems to think you can). The main quest is Oh man. Talk about overrated. Reviewers see amazing graphics and suddenly its the ""game of the year."" There's a huge number of problems with this game, and that's not because of bugs. First of all, the main quest is horribly written, and, unlike Oblivion, you can't continue playing after it (although PC Gamer's editor still seems to think you can). The main quest is essentially a drawn-out version of a ""fix this thing by getting this item"" quest. You're not saving your people, you're not fighting bad guys, but rather repairing a water pump. Some favorite bits: 1) when one major character dies from being in a room filled with huge amounts of radiation, while characters in the same room live without any further explanation. 2) PC Gamer review: ""But most egregious is the late-game introduction of a character that refuses to use the special abilities that are his raiso d'etre, injecting a farcical interlude into an otherwise poignant moment."" This ""poignant moment"" is nothing short of one of the most ridiculous endings I've seen in a video game, period. I won't spoil it for you, but I definitely won't say its worth the trouble. Most of the story is a re-tread of old ideas from the previous games. Yes, it is supposed to be in the same vein as the previous Fallout games, but FO3 does not achieve that. Whereas decisions in previous games would affect the entire world, blowing up a whole town will only make a couple of main-quest NPC's take real notice. The dialogue sticks out as the some of the most horrible I've seen in a long time. Having a high intelligence will allow you to state things that are obvious, rather than insightful. Such as when speaking to Three Dog during the GNR quest, the player can say: ""[Intelligence] So you fight the Good Fight with you voice on Galaxy News Radio."" Another good example is during the first part of the Wasteland Survival Guide quest given by Moira (Bethesda's poor attempt at 'dark humor'): ""[Intelligence] The Raiders were using the pharmacy as a place to store their best gear."" As Bethesda's Pete Hines said: ""Dialogue wasn't a battle we wanted to pick ... we just don't have unlimited monkeys and typewriters."" The gameplay itself does not make up for FO3's other flaws. Combat is ridiculous: you can take a direct hit from a missile launcher and keep going (while wearing leather armor, no less), Raiders and other enemies can take 20 rounds of 10mm hollow-points to the face without dying, and a number of the ""long-range"" weapons (such as the Sniper Rifle) are useless due to the fact they have poor accuracy even if you have mastered the small arms skill. Even at maximum difficulty, the game doesn't provide much of a challenge to either RPG or FPS fans, and a number of the Oblivion's flaws are in Fallout 3. Most notably, just as in Bethesda's previous endeavor, the game quickly devolves into an endless cycle of dungeon-crawl, fetch an object, trade loot, complete quest, and repeat. Very quickly into the game, playing becomes dull and monotonous. Especially when you reach the level cap of 20. At this point, only the promise of interesting quests will keep you playing, and as I have stated, well-developed ones are few and far between. Amazingly, the side quests aren't even as good as Oblivion's. Fallout 3 fails in that it accomplishes neither the goal of an RPG, namely, a deep, believable world with interesting characters and a good story, nor does it accomplish the goal of an FPS; to provide an exciting combat experience and intense gameplay while you pursued an objective. It is at no point immersive, as you feel detached from the world of the game. Few of the characters have any depth or logic behind their actions. It fails to be a sandbox-type game, as you are limited to doing the same things Oblivion allows you to do. In the original Fallout series, you could play most of the game in a way that focused on dialogue, or focus on stealth rather than confrontation. Perhaps Bethesda dumbed down the combat so that characters with weak fighting skills could more easily survive the battles they are constantly forced into. Additionally, the game world is tiny, even smaller than Oblivion. While this does mean that there is less walking distance, it also served as a convenient excuse to put less into the game. There are few unique areas, and even they follow the tired dungeon formula of Oblivion (in fact, the majority of 'dungeons' in the game actually are underground). All in all, Oblivion has some strengths: graphics, a solid engine, and good performance. However, it lacks either a solid RPG or FPS element. Characters aren't interesting, and combat is almost as dull and repetitive. It may have nice looks, but there's not a lot of meat on the bones here. There's just no challenge to this game.",Malithion

There was only 1 that I found even slightly fun (Clayface). The one shining addition to the game play was the Catwoman story. While she plays similarly to Batman, she has a unique role and style. In fact, she has an alternate game ending, so if you do play it, see if you can find it.I don't know if I'm more upset that this game was a complete waste of money and time or that even now, I really hope that the developer patches this game with fixes so that it can become a good game like Batman AA.

In fact, the entire multiplayer experience feels like a comic book. I can't explain it but it just feels juvenile. Next is the sound. The weapons in this game sound like airsoft or some pop gun battles. Is my weapon suppressed? I can't tell because regardless they all just seem to push air. My Turtle Beaches are useless.

The Shimmering Flats (now called the Shimmering Deep) is the only place which has changed significantly. All the other zones are essentially the same minus a ridiculous amount of extra flight paths, and small sections of burnt up and/or regrown portions of old zones. Some zones didn't change at all.Instances are the same as they've always been despite peoples' arguments that they require more crowd control. That is false. Every new expansion that has come out has required some sort of crowd control because their gear is not on par with the scale of difficulty. Give it 6 months and some high-end raid gear and people will revert back to ""tank and spank"" mentality. But the worst part about dungeons, raids, etc. is the fact that the group makeup has been exactly the same in this game and in every other MMO. Dungeons: Tank, healer, 3 dps. Raids: Scale up the ratio of dungeons. For crying out loud, can't anyone come up with something original for once?But the worst part of the expansion has got to be the PVP. I'm not even sure what the actual names of the new battlegrounds are because I've nicknamed them ""Simple Arathi Basin"" and ""Warsong Gulch 2."" Aside from looks, the only difference between Arathi Basin and ""Simple Arathi Basin"" is that you fight over 3 nodes instead of 5. There is no logistical difference between Warsong Gulch and ""Warsong Gulch 2."" They basically took Warsong Gulch and divided the two sections with a river. World PVP is also no different. People queue up for Tol Barad every couple hours, some AFK, some actually play, and Horde typically win because they outnumber Alliance on most servers. And as far as the ""fight"" for Tol Barad is concerned, it's essentially a mix of Arathi Basin and Wintergrasp, but without tanks. Archaeology will bore you to tears and yes, you will get cool rewards for doing it but it's even worse than fishing. Lastly, there is nothing ""MASSIVE"" about this game or any other ""MMO"" these days. Maybe I'm feeling a little dejected about the MMO genre as a whole but I simply don't find 10 vs. 10, 15 vs. 15, or even 20 vs. 20 very massive.

I found myself wrapped up in it. Although admittedly the whole ""Outsider"" thing is very... odd. The graphics and the sounds are good enough too. Yes, this type of plot has been done before, but why is that considered such a bad thing to warrant such a low score? How many movies, shows, books, and songs have the same themes and storylines over and over and over again?Second, while this is dubbed as a stealth action game, I do have to admit that the options for stealth are fairly limited (mostly blink+choke or blink+avoid or maybe a sleep dart here and there). Plus you really can go around running and gunning, although on the harder difficulties that's obviously more of a challenge to do. However, I still found myself enjoying the gameplay and I don't think it's bad but I don't think it's great either. It's definitely not as complex as you would think.Third, I do have gripes about the game although they're relatively minor. My biggest gripe would have to be the lack of options for equipment. You're basically stuck with a sword, a pistol, and a crossbow. I'm a sucker for new items and equipment in games so I was somewhat disappointed when I found that you don't use anything other than those three main items. Of course, there's the whole magic component, but that's a different matter.Honestly, for all those people asking for something completely new or different, I wish you the best of luck. Those games are rare for a reason: coming up with completely new material that not only works well but sells well is extremely difficult nowadays. Not to mention all you whiners about ""they stole this from that game"" etc etc... you do realize that every single step of progress humanity has ever made was because of ""stolen"" ideas/material from what we've done in the past?Overall, I enjoyed this game. While not a perfect 10, it's a solid albeit short game and one that I'd recommend to my friends.",Toffenuff

It's been out now for 10 months and I keep returning to it only to go through the process if disappointment. Pretty much all of the problems from PC1 still exist and it doesn't feel like enough of an upgrade over the last game to even warrant it's existence.Negative points.....- Don't even bother with aTo me this has been the most disappointing game in the last 5 years. It's been out now for 10 months and I keep returning to it only to go through the process if disappointment. Pretty much all of the problems from PC1 still exist and it doesn't feel like enough of an upgrade over the last game to even warrant it's existence.Negative points.....- Don't even bother with a controller. You'll spend hours upon hours of trying to calibrate it, but you'll never be quite 100% comfortable and you're settings will always be a compromise.- Be prepared to spend just as much time setting a wheel up. Again, it will always be a compromise, but it'll never quite feel natural and like a wheel should feel.- Some of the concepts and mechanics don't quite work, such as tire warming. Sometimes it will take 10 minutes of lapping just to warm your tires up, which is just silly and unrealistic. 10/10 for effort, 1/10 for actually pulling it off. It genuinely took me a full lap of the Nurburgring once to hate the tires up on an LMP car, and in a Group C car it took 2 laps of Le Mans to get them hot, both super high down force cars which would have no issue hating tires up.- The AI is the worst AI I've come across in my 20 years of playing racing games. It makes Forza AI look competent. What makes it even worse is that the tire heating mentioned above doesn't seem to apply to the AI, so when you're in qualifying, taking your 17 laps to heat your tires up the AI will be out at full pace, if you slow down and move over to let them past they'll sit behind you instead of overtaking, however, when you're actually doing the qualifying laps at full pace they'll be nudging you and inappropriately diving down the inside at the most ridiculous times imaginable.- ""Alternative physics"". Yep, they got the physics so wrong that they have had to implement a second set for when a car loses traction. The problem with this is that cars lose traction constantly. If you go over a small bump and a wheel loses contact with the ground that is the same as losing traction. What this means is that if you drive along a bumpy track or in a low grip car, the alternate physics start kicking in, which means the handling becomes a mess. This limits you to high grip cars and smooth circuits to even stand a hope of driving. If you don't believe me and would like like to test this out you need a steering wheel. If you drive along the Le Mans straight and let go of the wheel, without any input watch how the steering wheel starts violently veering left to right, this is your alternate physics fighting the regular physics.- The (badly thought out) car setting menu requires a game pad alongside a wheel. The problem with this is that it's 50/50 whether the game will pair the game pad alongside the wheel. I've never had this issue with any other game before. I recently spent 40 minutes turning my console on and off, disconnecting my wheel and controller, resetting the game, resetting the controller and generally pissing about to get it to pair them both at the same time. This happens far too often.I could go on for hours, so lets look at some neutral and positive points.Neutral points.- There isn't as much variety as people seem to think.Positive points- After you have spent 30 hours getting your calibrations right, selected the right car, the right track and then spent a considerable amount of time setting the car up to behave like it would in real life, it can be a mildly good game, like a 5/10. It probably would've been a decent game in 2004.I bought PC1 quite excited, but was disappointed. I let it slip and expected PC2 to be better. It was far worse. I will never buy an SMS game again. Buy Assetto Corsa instead, It has less content but it's actually a fully functional game.",Dave100e

The game has evolved considerably since I first started playing. I can remember when each nation only had a handful of aircraft. Now the game boasts over 300+ Unique aircraft (Guiness World Record). And the game also now has tanks for Russia, Germany and the US. They just added a few premium British tanks as well.WarThunder has a variety of modes to appeal to a variety of different people. Arcade is a good mode for quick matches. Realistic battles are more challenging and remove aim indicators. And full sim battles are particularly intense in that your view is restricted to the commander or cockpit view.The vehicles all have distinct characteristics and models and perform differently as a result. You can go a whole match without scoring one kill and still come out on top of the leaderboard if you play the objectives. If you manage to belly land your plane after sustaining critical damage your rewarded for it. If you take a lot of hits your rewarded for it with an adamant reward. Playing in a squad and assist your team mate killing a tank; your rewarded for it. This is in stark contrast to a game like WoT. In WoT you get one spawn, and when your vehicle's HP pool is depleted thats it. In WarThunder you can try to get back to base in your plane. Or you can repair your tank in the field if you have the repair module unlocked. You aren't just given a static 'death' animation once your HP is depleted as you get in WoWP.It also needs to be said that the tanks have evolved quite a bit in WarThunder. With changes like ground deformation you see your tank's tracks sinking into the ground. And if you get into 'muddy' terrain. Your tank becomes covered in Mud and ends up bogged down. The new Dagor 4.0 engine allows for fully destructible environments.WarThunder also has a great customization system. You can put decals on your vehicles, adjust their camo, and on tanks you can even adjust how worn that camo is. Or you can load up the texture in photoshop or another program and make your own skins.WarThunder has a lot to offer especially for being a free game. People have criticized its microtransactions and premium vehicles. I think its important to distinguish that WarThunder is a free to play game. Your not paying $60 and another $50-60 on top of that for a season pass. Any free to play game needs to be monetized in some way. Its how the developer makes money off said game. The premium vehicles aren't pay to win either as some might suggest. In fact a fully upgraded stock tank tends to be better statistically than a premium of its tier. The only real advantage premium vehicles have is that they have greater credit and XP earning potential.You may find yourself coming back for more and more. I know I have. Especially when new vehicles are released. Like the recent addition of the B-29. What are you waiting for? Go download the game; and see you in the skies and on the ground!",LoneWolfSones

I dare say that a heavily New Vegas may come suspiciously close to Fallout 4 in terms of customization even. Other than that - it is almost identical with Pip-boy menu and interacting with the world.Immersion and story:Hm - this one certainly does not stand out much. The story is clichÃ©d and simplified. I miss the black humor of New Vegas DLCs (yea - only the DLCs .. New Vegas vanilla did not have such a great story either - but even NV vanilla had a better story than FO 4 vanilla)Difficulty and open world:The AI is better than FO3/NV ... but not by much. The world feels a lot smaller, more cramped than Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 - due to being more detailed in looks - but also because there are more hotspots that spawn stuff.  When you are meant to escort someone through ""the perilous Wasteland to his destination""  - and it turns out that his destination was almost in plain sight all along - it kind of breaks immersion about the ... well.. ""wasteland"" being this open wide arena.Things i am disappointed with:Customizing weapons looked like you were able to actually use almost any ""stuff"" you found and try to make it into a weapons part (from how it seemed to be in the early trailer) - but it turns out to be ""just"" a New Vegas style of customization/upgrading. So i cannot use my 10mm pistol grip on a laser rifle that fires through a pipe repeater barrel or so. (yes - i know it makes no sense but still) - So the system is fun and nice, but i had kind of - maybe unjustly - expected more. Also it seems that New Vegas customization - while not offering the same amount of options - had more impact. (truth be told - New Vegas was less modding and more upgrading)NPCs. Especially New Vegas had a huge amount of interesting NPCs .. from Red Mesa to Old World Blues - and even the vanilla NPCs. Compared to those .... the NPCs i encountered in FO4 are in one word ... boring. They are stereotypes of your ""101 needy quest-giver"" that will send you out on a suicide mission to fetch some useless stuff. While that is kind of the case for most RPGs ... The world of Fallout does not seem to be ""alive"" much.

Game Freak took a big chance in removing all the pokemon from the previous games, however I think this give the player a chance to experience something great. You are now put into a situation where you cannot rely on using the same pokemon you have been using years before. You must dig down back into the roots of pokemon, when you first started playing. That experience of seeing a new pokemon, that feeling of trying to come up with a team of pokemon you have never used before. It's a truly nostalgic experience. Looking at some of the designs of the pokemon of this game you'll see that many are similar to the original 151. This allows the players to have an idea of how the new pokemon will play, while still changing the pokemon around enough to make them unique from the originals. The designs are incredibly fresh as well, with nothing overly complicated (except for a handful of very specific ones), but nothing boringly simple. There are some REALLY amazing designs in this game, some of which are a little darker than others if you dig deep into their lore, giving the game a bit of a more adult feel. In addition, the plot to this game is magnificent (by pokemon standards). It asks the player challenging, adult questions at times, and some players are left to ponder their childhood games. There's actually quite some bit of character development in the games rivals and main antagonist. In addition, there's a bunch of great surprises that will keep this game outstandingly fresh, especially towards the end.In conclusion, this game was made for the fans. Game Freak knew the players of the original games where getting more mature and many wanted a little more significant pokemon game. So, Game Freak decided to make a game for them. It is a game that appeals to the new players in that there are crisp and cool new pokemon designs, and keeps the basic elements of the games beforehand. It appeals to older pokemon players in that they can get a fresh breath of air, while still being able to go on an adventure similar to their first encounter with the game. It fixes some minor issues, challenges older players, and holds what is probably some of the best pokemon Game Freak have to offer. Over all, it is (in my humble opinion), the best pokemon game to date.(ps. Vanilluxe is one of my favorite pokemon, eat your heart out genwunners)",TVHeadTed

I am so glad that the queer undertones were that - undertones.  As high schoolers, these girls are still inventing themselves and it's great that they didn't use hard and fast labels to describe themselves.  As a lesbian myself, it was so awesome to see a game studio delicately and respectfully handle the story of two young women developing their sexuality.  Their relationship wasn't based on physical intimacy - it was based on love, solidarity, and a shared history.  The writers captured very well the tumultuous whirlwind that is a relationship between two girls!  Bravo to them!  I would love to see another installment, but I simply don't know how they would do it without stripping the luster off this first installment(re: how the Matrix Reloaded corrupted the experience of watching the original The Matrix).

Alone in the world Bayonetta sets out to find the truth behind the events that unfolded only to find herself faced with angelic hordes intent on killing her.Created by Hideki Kamiya, the man behind Devil May Cry and Viewtiful Joe, Bayonetta delivers a fantastically over the top third person action game. Most importantly the fighting mechanics are arguably the best of any video game this generation. It is at once easy to grasp for beginners yet deep enough to encourage players to experiment. As expected the face buttons allow the player to kick, punch and fire Bayonetta's hand guns. The real key however is the ability to enter a 'bullet (Witch) time' mode by holding the right trigger just before an enemy lands an attack. This allows the player to give themselves some breathing space or land damage on tougher enemies. As well as many types of regular enemy Bayonetta also features its share of boss fights and virtually every one makes for a fantastic spectacle. Many are simply gargantuan is size and often require a bit of brain as well as brawn to defeat.Bayonetta herself makes for a fantastic lead character managing to be sexy, calm and confident all at the same time and is a joy to watch even during cut scenes.All in all this is a fantastic action game that aside from a slightly confusing story line does very little wrong.

When it comes to open sandbox worlds that are enormous it is safe to say Bethesda holds one of the top positions in that genre. At top resolution Skyrim is graphically beautiful. Like many of Bethesda games however, it can lag at times and at lower resolution the graphics can look shabby. I think in today's gaming world your home entertainment products dictate much or what you game will look like. On it's own Skyrim is beautiful. Gameplay is exciting and full of the usual adventure you would expect from this title. I love the open world exploring and diversity of the game. I didn't feel like I was in a copy and paste world full of templates that some developers use for their games. Each room, tunnel, and cave had it's own unique personality. The melee fighting is still sloppy (as per usual and for me, expected) but the ranged combat is still fun. The ability to use both hands make for some cool customized ways to take out opponents. The biggest complaint I have (surprise!) are the game breaking bugs. I am on my second play through. My first play through caught a bug in Winterhold after doing a quest for the Jarl. For some reason I was offered a duplicate quest (getting the helm for the Jarl to gain him respect) when I brought the second helm back to him (found in a different location?) he refused to take it from my inventory and following the quest all subsequent quest items were not being removed from my inventory by the NPC's once I completed the quest. So basically all quest items were stuck in my inventory. This obviously would have become a big problem down the line so after a few more hours of game play I erased my PS3 files for Skyrim and started from scratch. Many complaints on Metacritic relate to these bugs in Skyrim. I guess I know that Bethesda pushes the hardware for the systems it uses and makes the game so huge that I expect bugs at this point. It would probably take a million testers 5 years to find all the bugs with a game this size. I don't condone nor condemn Bethesda for these bugs; I have come to expect them and accept them. They have never acknowledged their games are bug free and even before releasing Skyrim talked about an online patch system they have because of the expected bugs. For those who complain...you should have known by now what to expect and know by now the key rule to a Bethesda game: Save often.Overall, this is one of the best games I have ever played (been playing since the 2600) and I would encourage anyone who loves adventure, randomness, and discovery, to play this game.

I have found the experience to be undeniably fun, although short lived and cheap. On normal difficulty I had 100% completion in about 20 hours, which in my opinion is not worth the fifty dollar price.The strongest, or most interesting, mechanic in this game is probably the addition of superpowers in a sandbox-type environment, which leads to a lot of goofing around. Navigating the city by running around faster than cars and jumping over buildings was still as enjoyable at the twentieth hour of gameplay as it was during the first. However, the implementation of superpowers feels only skin deep and points a big spotlight on the lack of work put in by the developers. Now, most likely this wasn't entirely the developers' fault, but rather a decision made by the publisher to upgrade from an expansion pack/DLC (that this game was originally meant to be) to a full game.Why is the implementation of superpowers so shallow? For one, the starting offensive superpower, the freeze blast, is the one that you will probably use 95% of the time in combat. Bad guys appear. You freeze them, which makes most enemies one hit kills, stops them from dealing damage to you, and breaks any special attacks that tougher enemies might be planning to unleash on you. Occasionally, the game will force you to change powers for some specific task, like a special game mode/activity, but there is no fluidity to using different powers in combat. What I would expect from a game with so many superpowers and ways to customize them is some sort of ""rock-paper-scissor"" mechanic or a chain/combo mechanic where you ""start off with one of these, then give 'em one of these, and give 'em two of those for good measure""  all while peppering them with small arms fire. Instead, you drop in on your enemies unannounced, push the ""I win"" button(Q by default), shoot the survivors, and you're off on your next adventure. Nothing but a quick disposable thrill, just tie it and throw it in the trash.Now this game isn't serious, nor did I expect it to be (it is Saints Row after all), but you quickly run out of ways to goof around. There is only so many unique things that you can do. And I'm not talking about ""activities"" or the mini-games, which you'll just breeze through anyway (and enjoyably, at least for me), but I've found the sandbox experience rather limited. Your gang is essentially useless, since you're a one man army. The game sticks you into a sandbox, but all the sand is dry and your tools are useless; so the only thing that you can really build is a big dune.Despite everything I've said, Saints Row IV is not a bad game. You will probably enjoy playing it, but don't expect the feeling of a full game. For a 20 hour long experience, the material presents itself ok, throws a few decent punch lines your way, metaphorically speaking, and leaves before it overstays its welcome. It's just not worth the ticket price. Just a publisher looking to cash in on some recently bought intellectual property.",kamerad

It's sad though that the game seems to have been designed to be ""thrown over the wall"" to the modding community but many of the issues with the game seem to have been the result of narrowly-focused goals where flexibility was not considered important. Again, ""one size fits all""I will enjoy the game for what it is- playing at a slow pace- as I like to explore and interact verbally rather than just sequentially  blowing heads off in a shower of blood and complete the game as fast as possible - and will mod the game when possible and slowly move toward seeing and enjoying everything I can in this massive, complex, and enthralling world",txriddle

It would be cool if they had half as many mountains, but each one was it's own open world that you had to clear to get to the next one. Also, the game gets fairly monotonous after awhile because there are only a few types of events. In comparison, On Tour, which was a PS2 game, had many different types of events. The addition of areas where you can fall off the track is stupid. To me, part of the fun of SSX was trying to recover when you ran into a tree or fell when you went a little too far with the tricks. Now, with parts where you fall off the track it takes a lot of the fun out of the game. Another thing that is frustrating with this game is how dependent you are on boost to win races. Instead of the race being about taking good lines staying low to the ground and going fast, it's about trying to as many tricks as you can so you can get boost. Without boost you can't even stay in the race. Another thing I noticed during races is that you hardly see your opponents outside of the very first part of the race. There's too many different routes on the track and not enough opponents going against you. I remember how fun it was in On Tour when your opponent would try to pass you and you would punch him to the ground. Another puzzling thing about SSX is the inability to create your own character. You are forced to choose from pre-made characters. This game doesn't have the same flow of the old SSX games, instead of a 10 to 20 run, you have these little short 2 to 3 minute runs. I can't remember how many times in On Tour I would start at the top of the mountain and ski or snowboard (oh yeah, no skiing in this one either) all the way down, trying to check out every part of the mountain.

It seeded itself into my heart as one of the most magical experiences from my childhood, and therefor my life so far. I've heeded the call to save ZeldaI want to establish something before I write this review: When I purchased Skyward Sword, I was tremendously excited to play it. Zelda is a big deal to me. I'm 20 years old, so I was the perfect age to discover Ocarina of Time when I did. It seeded itself into my heart as one of the most magical experiences from my childhood, and therefor my life so far. I've heeded the call to save Zelda and Hyrule many times over now. I've traveled to other lands and even other dimensions, and just when I think I've seen it all, each games offers an array of new experiences and topics. Every game in the series thus far has given me memories that I'll always have, even now (I only recently beat Wind Waker and A Link to the Past). The point that I want to make is that I had never been disappointed in a Zelda game, and never imagined I ever would be, until Skyward Sword.Whatever excitement I had tearing into the foil around the case and putting the disc into the Wii was rather quickly diminished after maybe an hour of playing this game. After Twilight Princess, I had come to expect long tutorials in Zelda, but come on.. And when you finally arrive in the untamed world of Hyrule, it resembles a playground. There are only three areas on the map for you to explore, and theyre all quite small. It's very simple: there's a forest area, a volcano area, and a desert area, and they're not that attractive visually. You will be visiting the same three maps many, many times. Yes, these maps expand later, but its not enough, and 2 out of 3 times, those additions are too similar to the original map for my taste. They just feel like simple levels in the game, rather than areas to explore, without anyone to really interact with on the scale seen in nearly every Zelda game before. That brings me to the characters. I don't like them, no one stands in a way I'll remember, aside from the core characters in the story, and there aren't too many. I did however feel myself really involved in Groose's story, but ultimately failed to impress me. Fi has her moments, but you can count them on one hand. The story itself is okay, but ""safe"". I wish Nintendo would have tried new things this time around, given the production time of this game. It just doesnt stand out over any Zelda game I've played before, at all. I do remember going back and forth fetching items many times though. While it does have plenty of moments, it could have been much more. And for fans who care, there are maybe 2 memorable songs in this game. That's saying a lot for a Zelda title. What I feel happened is Nintendo sacrificed much of their grasp on what makes their franchise magical because of the focus on the Wii Motion Plus, which is sad, because it doesn't work that well. Before Skyward Sword was released, I trusted Nintendo that they would never implement a control scheme into a Zelda game if it did not work, and I was excited to see the Motion Plus in action, but it immediately failed to deliver. He never held the sword like I was holding it. I struggled with swinging my sword exactly the way I needed to for hours. Hours of clumsy buggy controls. What's sad is that you can feel the potential, had the Wii Motion Plus delivered. Most of the items are great ideas, but like the swordplay, they come up short because of how buggy the controls are overall. Most frustratingly, the ""Skyward Strike"", which consists of you charging your sword by holding the Wiimote over your head and then swinging it downwards, is a pretty important part of the final boss battle, and in the heat of the moment, it failed 4 out of 5 times. I died 13 times before I beat him.One thing I really did like: the dungeons. You will remember these dungeons, they are terrifically difficult, and all of the items in your inventory to good use during your time in each one. They feel fantastic, look fantastic, and you'll feel all the more brilliant every time you conquer one. Too bad most of the bosses disappoint,  save a couple (Dungeon 5's boss is a brilliant battle). I'm giving this game a 7 out of 10, and I wrote this review with the intention of justifying a 6 out of 10 score, but there are redeeming points in this game. It's still a lengthy adventure, full of puzzles and things to be discovered, but there are so many disappointments, which is rare for this series. This was my least favorite title in that series, so I think it speaks for the entire series that I'm giving it a decent 7. Try not to buy it, but any Zelda fan should play it, but don't expect anything more memorable than anything released in this franchise's impressive 25-year run.",mattysurvive

The character AI is surprisingly solid, a huge leap from the cardboard box of Oblivion, aside from the common person walking up to you mid-conversation, yelling about their knee. The combat lacks at times, but the finishing moves, the dual casting, and dual wielding add a splendid flourish that still keeps the game otherwise fresh. The content is so grand and generous that after a few hours of playing I felt myself sitting on a mountain of goodies and treasures that would make a rich man feel full. However I could still see on the proverbial horizon a plethora of content still to be explored and gathered. Grapically, this goes without saying, is absolutely superb. I stared at a running stream for 10 minutes in awe, before turning around and losing my mind over a mountain side. The game is worthy of every solid review and award it receives.

There is no shortage to games set in a science fiction universe but getting to interact with a portal gun gives us a chance to interact with the science of fiction. Its such and obvious opportunity of games but sadly is missing by most popular titles in the industry whom would rather focus on the immature sensation of violence. Portal 2s focus on good design and puzzle solving rather than the immaturity of violence and 'bad-ass'ness is a big plus making it stand out as intelligent from the dumb gaming crowd. It's pacing is for the most part excellent but not better than the original. There is some filler in portal 2 and although a longer game is what fans (including myself) asked for, a longer game does not make it a better game. The visual design is terrific. The simple robot design, architecture, and visual atmosphere enhances the game play, story and brings something new and original to the bloated science fiction side of video games. A big shout out also goes to the music, its worth listening to just on its own. The character development of GlaDos is fantastic, although in the first Portal she is a simply a funnier copy of the A.I character: Dave from 2001: Space Odyssey, Valve explores GlaDos even more and in a slight different direction making her one of the best characters of video games in years and a terrific villain. Its an achievement to how much we actually CARE about the robots in Portal 2. Portal 2 does however fall into the common video game trap of spoon feeding players where to go, and almost not allowing a player to get stuck for too long and then master the gameplay. I read a lot of over praise to how flawless the puzzles are however I cant feel that they did not made them hard enough (which would have made them better) just to keep the story flowing, it is a puzzle game after all, please make some HARD puzzles. Portal 2 is a satisfying title full of memorable moments, witty laugh out loud humour and a plot with unpredictable surprises and joins the handful of must play titles of this generation. It would have been so easy for most developers to screw up, but Valve pulled it off as well as they could. Its not the perfect 10 that people keep screaming, and its not better than the original which I would almost call a masterpiece but  is one of the best games this generation.Ã¢",davenbettridge

Brawl, I'm going to look back into Mass Effect 2, my first ever game review on this site. It's been two years and I still consider Mass Effect 2 to be the greatest Xbox 360 game I have ever played up to now (The Mass Effect series was born on the 360 and it plays better on the 360 so it's a 360 game to me) and one of my all time favourite games ever. To sum up the whole series itself, The Mass Effect series, in my opinion, is one of the greatest Science Fiction series ever made and it is up there with Star Wars, Dr. Who and Star Trek. Its mythology and settings are imaginative and well thought out, the story is amazingly compelling and superbly written,its characters are unforgettable and endearing and the greatest thing about it; you decide how this story goes and ends. If Star Wars had a choice mechanic, I would've shot Jar-Jar straight away. I'm digressing. Mass Effect 2 delivers better than the first Mass Effect with a darker, higher stake story, better written script, a cast of amazing and interesting characters, intuitive combat mechanics, more accessible yet still complex RPG elements and better visuals. Another great thing about this game is that you can transfer your Mass Effect save file and this is the thing that made Mass Effect 2 great and the thing that cemented the series as one of the greats in my opinion. If you want to experience Mass Effect 2 in full effect, save your Mass Effect game file. The result will be one of the most personal gaming experiences. The choices that you make in Mass Effect makes a huge impact on how Mass Effect 2's story will go and the same with Mass Effect 3 when it finally comes out. If you are planning to get Mass Effect 3, get Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 first and spend your 2 months playing through those games and preparing any story you want for Mass Effect 3's final climax. What more can I say about this game and this whole series? Mass Effect 2 is a triple A title brimming with absolute sci-fi and gaming heaven.

197868,The Walking Dead: Episode 3 - Long Road Ahead,PC,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I am going to be honest, this episode was pretty **** depressing and also... Annoying.It seems as if the purpose of this episode is to teach to never to like anything or anyone in a video game. It's like as if happy things don't exist in zombie games. Everyone just has to **** die. Emotionally attached to Carley? **** that, let her kiss you on the cheek and hint you at being a love interest AND THEN get shot in the face by Lilly! Yay!Emotionally attached to Duck after he acts so awesome by being your helper as a detective? Who needs him, infect him and kill him! Woo!Started to feel compassion for Katjaa? **** that, let her kill herself for no apparent reason (okay, I know, your son died, but you still have your husband goddammit).Jesus. Dark and gruesome zombie games don't have these many liked characters die.And what's most important is that some of your choices have no impact in the long term.If you save Carley or Doug, both of them die either way. If you side with Kenny or Lilly, there's nobody to be friends with by the end of Episode 3.If you decide to do as much as possible for characters to like you, all that's gonna happen is they're gonna die.That doesn't mean it's a bad game, though. It's 'fun' (when you're not smashing your table out of frustration or crying until your room is filled with salt water) and aesthetically rich. It has an environment to explore and interesting characters (except for Kenny, **** that guy).I think I gave the previous episodes a 9 (no 10 for having some parts of the game have terribly ugly textures that would look horrible when zoomed into during cutscenes).This episode gets a 8.. Remarkable job, TellTale. I like this game, but if your excuse for killing so many characters is 'it's because it's a zombie game', I **** hate zombie games from now on.",gvazdas

Despite this the developers have listened to some of the criticisms levelled at the games and included a number of the improvements fans have long been asking for.The game of course still sees the player taking on the role of a child travelling from town to town collecting Pokemon and using them to battle all manner of opponents. Despite the familiar concept Pokemon Black is a more streamlined experience. Little things like combining the Pokemon Centre and Poke Mart into one building for example cuts down on pointless travelling whilst battles also run at a slightly quicker pace.Two new types of battle are also included. Triple battles obviously allow for three Pokemon to fight at once whilst rotation battles allow the player to switch out Pokemon before each attack adding a new level of strategy to the game. Some Pokemon can now also combine moves to create more powerful attacks making the selection of a balanced team even more essential.For the first time since the Game Boy original this version features a completely new set of Pokemon. Many of these are not as well designed as the original group but it does make exploration more interesting. No longer will you enter a cave to be greeted by yet another Zubat or Geodude. It is possible to get some of the older Pokemon once you complete the game or by using some of the bonus features but as per usual most have to be transferred from your save games on previous iterations.Wrongly looked upon as 'a game for kids' Pokemon remains once the most in depth and strategic RPGs available on any console and with its more streamlined approach the Black or White game are as good a place to start as any.,drlowdon

Additionally yes you can go toe to toe with the bad guys but at a world changing cost. I've been opting for a more pacifictic approach in knocking out or tranking my foe's & not getting busted, or just plane avoidence. This is very difficult but rewarding as you must ""Blink"" from location to location and not get busted. The whole of the maps are very ""puzzle"" like and in combination with npc movements require you to truely think and plan your course of action. Stratigy really is the common in this game. Additionally the magic really gives a unique flavor to the experince as it's very different from say Skyrim or Dragonage. It's all ment to be combined and tactical. Magic is also very smooth, not at all sticky. The story so far is fairly compelling although somewhat a ""been-there"" plot but not enough to be boring. The tech in the game seems to be a mix of Fallout meets Batman, meets the 1790's, which for me is all very cool. Appairently you can go through the whole of the game without killing anyone which is very difficult. I would truely recomend this for anyone who wants a very grim, creepy, Batman/Half-life kind of experience. I think this is going to be a ground-breaking game.

266154,Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia,3DS,8,"Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia does not follow the Fire Emblem formula as much as previous entries. Since Echoes is a remake of Fire Emblem Gaiden it lacks some of the staple mechanics that fans love such as the weapon triangle, class skills, and branching promotions, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Fire Emblem hosts many mechanics that may overwhelm new players, soFire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia does not follow the Fire Emblem formula as much as previous entries. Since Echoes is a remake of Fire Emblem Gaiden it lacks some of the staple mechanics that fans love such as the weapon triangle, class skills, and branching promotions, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Fire Emblem hosts many mechanics that may overwhelm new players, so getting rid of a couple may actually do Echoes a favor.For veteran fans it may be odd to attack a sword unit with a lance unit, but it doesn't take much time to adjust. In fact, this game feels closer to an action RPG with the classic grid-based battles Fire Emblem is known for. The dungeons offer a fun distraction from the constant big battles that vets are used to. The map design within dungeons aren't particularly challenging because they're generally just a square with maybe a few chunks of terrain spaces between your units and the enemies. The same can be said for many of the main battle maps that progress the story. Most of the maps that aren't huge fields with some terrain spaces randomly strewn about the area are probably two open fields connected by a small lane generally 1-2 spaces wide. It may feel a bit disappointing hot off the heels of the great maps in Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest and Revelation, but I see this more as an opportunity to greet new players into the franchises combat system. These problems likely occur only because Echoes was meant to be as true as it could be to Gaiden-which was made on inferior technology. Mila's turnwheel also helps newcomers, but for veterans it can just be used to abuse the RNG system like an enemy hitting a low % critical hit.Supports makes a return in this game-even though it wasn't in Gaiden- and gives Intelligent Systems an opportunity to flesh out some characters that originally only had minimal development. Support conversations return to the battlefield like in the Gameboy titles, but there are a few changes. For one, there is no menu that directly tells you who can support with who. There are also passive supports-as they're referred to on the Fire Emblem Wiki-that provide a character with combat bonuses, but they cannot have a conversation with them. For example, Alm-one of the main characters-gets supports from the four characters who are childhood friends with him, but he can only converse with one of them-Faye. The pair-up system is gone, but, instead, when a unit is about to enter combat there will be small portraits in the upper-left of the screen indicating who the character is getting a support bonus from. You can get support bonuses from units who are more than one space away, but those portraits are the only way to know who a unit can support with. Besides support conversations, you can also converse with units in villages and Mila Shrines, and these conversations can also provide greater insight into a character. Marriage is taken out of the game-therefore kids have been removed as well-which is fine from a story standpoint and is a welcome removal.The story is far better than Fates' and doesn't stumble towards the end like Awakening's, but it definitely is not the most impressive. Fire Emblem's stories have never been innovative or magnificent, but, rather, its the characters that we get the most enjoyment out of-which there are plenty to enjoy. The story is competent and does a good job of developing some of the characters over others. The main enemies are hit-or-miss depending on who you are, but full voice-acting does wonders for the series. In every conversation I listened to with characters, none of the voice actors do a poor job. I applaud the localization efforts 8-4, Nintendo, and the voice actors. The translation is far better than Fates' and the characters feel so much more real and animated than they ever would have been in simple phrases that have nothing to with the actual text. In addition to these feats, Echoes boasts some of the best music in the entire franchise. In all of Act 1 you hear March of Deliverance (Prologue), but when you get the final battle of the act it switches to just March of the Deliverance and the change is just excellent. The overworld themes all do an excellent job as well, and, overall, the music and sound design in this game is exemplary.The combat animations aren't over the top like some of Fates' and the Gameboy titles', but they certainly are fluid and nice enough to look at. The character portraits all look very detailed and well done, so that is a job well done on the artists.Overall, this game is a welcome entry to the franchise. It feels the least Fire Emblem-y of all the ones I've played, and I see it as the best game to introduce people unfamiliar with the franchise and genre with. Map design is overall mediocre and the rest of my problems with this game are a bit nit-picky. If you can only see one major problem with a game and get into smaller problems than I think you have a great game on your hands.",Cartoondudedub

Being able to upgrade your weapons, armor, and ammo was also a cool feature. The biggest downside to being able to do those things was the design of the equipment menu system.

Only being able to go up and down the upgrade select screen one item at a time felt clunky at best, especially when your item count was near the 150 limit. The combat was another irritant, but only to a small degree. The fact that the cover system made you run into the item you were trying to hide behind, instead of using a button to initiate the cover, was annoying.

This is an amazingly beautiful game with some of the prettiest vistas and locations ive seen. Diverse enough to have snow, desert and tropical island in one game. Oblivion eat your heart out. Whats more is that it seems to be well optimised that lower spec pc's (within reason) can play it and still have it look fantastic. It has some pretty cool vehicles (military jet) and and awesome little locations like the floating zeppilin night club and the island from lost easter-egg. Sadly however these gold stars are not enough to make up for the river of crap they are floating on. Beginning with the smaller flaws: the weapons and most of the vehicles. Most of the guns are just plain boring with the revolvers being the coolest, if not the most efficient to use. Granted there is DLC but that doesnt add a great deal of fun stuff either. The most fun by far is the remote explosives which make stunning explosions (especially if you put them throughout an entire base and set them off simultaneously). Most of the vehicles are terrible. they are not fun to drive, handle like dogs and look a bit like barbie-mobiles. Even the tank is just a glorified APC (would have been so much cooler to have a T-80 or a challanger or something). Greater faults: the grappling hook + parachute. Yes they are fun. For the 1st hour. After that they become a tool for getting about mostly and the novelty of tying people up gets lost after the 50th group. There is only so many times you can do something before it gets dull. Getting about using the combo is waaaay too slow for the size of the game and is really just for when you cant find a better vehicle to do so in. Even in vehicles it takes stupidly long times to get anywhere and a jet is the only real way of doing so. This wouldnt be a problem however if it wasnt for the last, big major flaw:The Big one: Nothing exciting to do in sandbox mode. At all. Almost all the locations (of which there are hundreds) provide nothing to do other than find briefcases or kill some dumass AI soldiers in random villages or cities. Jumping off of buildings and generally doing stunts isnt actually any fun as it takes almost no amount of skill to do. This would also be less of a problem had a healthy storyline and side quests been present. They are however, identi-kit rush this base, pick up minigun, gun down chopper, repeat, missions. the storyline ones offer some variation, but even that is cheesy and only visual. Not to mention the ever present lip-sync bugs.Its all a real shame too. This game, with a better storyline, more varied and interesting side-quests (look to peers like GTA and Saints Row 2 for inspiration guys) and my personal desire (not actually that big a deal) more destructable objects other than radio towers, would have made this game almost perfect. On a sidenote, i personally noticed that this game became a lot more fun for me after i began using cheats. Infinite ammo (while still needing to reload) as well as infinie explosives were my favourite and seemed to make a massive difference to the entertainment value. Im still not quite sure whether this is in favour or against the game as a whole.In Summary:+ Beautiful game, almost no peers in this respect.+ Great explosions and demolitions+ Some cool vehicles, weapons and locations- Ways of getting around too dull, most vehicles not fun or useful- Most weapons not actually fun to use- Not much to actually do that is different - gets boring quickly- Repetitive missions and side quests- Bugs in sound syncing and other various non-game braking ones- Poor AIOverall: 4.5/10 (i rounded up to 5)P.S. at the time of writing, the game is ÃÂ£5 on steam. It is very hard to not recommend the game at that price as it will most probably provide enough play time and enjoyment for the money.",Saukuy

The three-game story arc immerses you in a world that is so detailed and lifelike that you can't help get lost in it, and to me, that's what's important. Meaningful characters, intricate gameplay, and RPG-style player input all add together to create probably my favorite game of all time. And remember, folks: the ending of the game isn't the entire game.",AzureSkies

Much like Crysis 2 was.The next thing that sucks is the terrible ""ello guv'nor"" British voices that waste my time and interrupt the game. They're boring and useless. They ramble on and bloody on and I can't skip them. I don't want to hear from some faceless boring voice actor trying to create excitement about rallying and telling me how ""sick"" it is. All I want to do is race the cars. It's a huge black mark against the game, in my opinion, and the one thing that routinely pisses me off when playing it.The racing itself is okay. Nothing particularly special. They've claimed it's got more rallying than other games in the series, but I wouldn't know after playing it. Actual rallying is in short supply here. There's not much of it, and the stages are incredibly short as well.The next thing that sucks are the Smelter levels. Well, they're okay, but *every* final is at the Smelter. It gets very dull. The track changes about, but it's the same location. Very poor.However, there is a reasonable variety in the races on offer. There's dune buggys, trucks, hill climbs, gymkhana and so on. If only they hadn't made a crap looking console game and ported it to the PC.Overall, it's a very shallow game. Not much rallying, average graphics, short races, annoying voice talking at you and wasting your time. You can further tell how crap it is because they've spent an inordinate amount of time making little documentaries about how good it is. It's not worth $50.

From the main character, a russian immigrant, to radio programs talking about terrorism and stuff and the ""american dream"". Also, DRM protection ends up screwing up all the rest of the things the game had. Let alone all the things you have to do in order to play it (*cough social club and windows live cough*). The only thing done right in this game are the little details. Cars not turning on, deformable cars, etc. Although as i said, some of them are absolutly useless.

Itâs 1995 when Katie Greenbriar returns home after a year in Europe to a violent thunderstorm, an empty house, and a missing family. Youâre then given a sort-of âlicense to snoopâ, an opportunity to search through, with a clear conscience, every note, letter, and personal artifact in the house to discover the whereabouts of the Greenbriar family.  Unlike the most popular videogames that balance action-based gameplay and an interesting storyline, Gone Home is focused almost completely on the plotline. But how can a game be good if Iâm unable to blow up aliens or drag race Lamborghinis, you might ask? Well, the short answer is it can be good â it can be really good, in fact. This game belongs in a class of itâs own, mainly because it encompasses the best characteristics of a good short story (or even a novel, for that matter) in a creative and interactive space. All of the clues and artifacts are there for you, but locating them will only get you so far; if you really want to understand whatâs going on, you have to remain sharp throughout the game, and start to pick up on trends (the good stuff comes when you start to connect the dots). I was quite surprised with how riveting the game was. Once I started, I became obsessed with finding all of the pieces to the puzzle and ultimately solving the mystery. That being said, the only thing I donât like about this game is that once youâve played it over a few times and understand everything thatâs going on, it quickly becomes boring. Itâs understandable and almost by design, but if I had to pick out one thing that I wish could be better, that would be it.  So, if the review doesnât scream it enough, I IMPLORE you to dabble into the brilliance of Gone Home. Immerse yourself in the beautifully designed game, and allow your headspace to become addicted to the mystery. Itâs fun, innovative, riveting, and youâll likely feel a little smarter after youâve finished and figured everything out. Overall, I give this game a top rating.

Everything you build is rusty and decaying despite being brandI'll give you an unbiased review.First - Gameplay:-If you try to play it in third person inside a building, you can't. Trying to pick up an item, pressing a button or shooting an enemy is a chore because of the bad camera;-The settlement building is ok at best. Once you start building stuff you see how shallow it is. Everything you build is rusty and decaying despite being brand new. There isn't much variety in what you can do with the settlement building and if you try to build walls on any terrain that isn't completely flat you will see the disaster, you will see how rushed and shallow this gimmick is. It is a great idea that suffers from poor execution.-The weapon crafting is the same as settlement building. Great idea that suffers from poor execution. Not only the weapons are ugly, but they look like something straight out of Borderlands. They don't look like real pipe weapons at all.  Just compare them to the Bosnian-war homemade weapons.-Power Armor suffers from the exact same problem as weapon crafting and settlement building: Poor execution. 10 minutes into the game you get the power armor. Another 10 minutes and you are swimming in fusion cores. The Power Armor in the Fallout franchise is supposed to be a really rare and end-game armor, not something you get in the first 10 minutes. This completely undermines it.-It is cool that enemies take cover now, but their AI is still as bad as it was in Fallout 3.-No sense of self-preservation, the enemy who is wielding a bat sees you in a power armor with a minigun and he/she still runs towards you and tries to kill you with his/hers bat.-Melee is still the same bad thing from Skyrim. Enemies standing still while hitting each other. Piper was just there gun-butting the Super Mutant in the head while the Super Mutant was hitting her with a piece of wood.-Bullet sponges. I played the game on Survival and there is no difficulty except for artificial difficulty a.k.a. bullet sponges. The enemies aren't clever, their AI is not improved, they are just turned into bullet sponges. Then there are some that are LEGENDARY bullet sponges that can ""mutate"" and restore their healths fully.This is not difficult at all. This is boring and turns the gameplay into a chore.I love when enemies outsmart me and I have to outsmart them, this is difficulty, but turning a dumb enemy into a bullet sponge is not difficulty. It is a really bad gameplay design.Second - The World and Lore:-If you ever played Fallout 1, 2 or New Vegas you probably understand how wrong the world of Fallout 4 is in the setting. If not, then there is no point explaining it here since it would take more than 5000 characters, but just a quick thing:Fallout is a post-apocalyptic game not focused on the destruction of the wasteland, but on the people rebuilding, the world being rich culturally and society going back to the way it was. You don't have that in Fallout 4. You have an empty world devoid of content (unless you call content the same copy-pasted ruins with the same ghouls or raiders, which I don't). And, oh yeah, plastic and micro-electronics in Fallout 4, both of them shouldn't exist because of the petrol shortage in the setting.-And why is the BoS destroying technology? They are hoarders, they want technological supremacy and to do that they hoard every piece of technology so their scribes can study them and make advancements. But in Fallout 4 they want to destroy technology.Third - The Characters and Interactions:-Fallout was always a game with charming characters, clever dialogue, dark humour and good voice acting.But no single character in Fallout 4 ever acts, speaks or thinks like a human being.-Courtney Taylor who amazingly voiced Jack in Mass Effect 2 and 3 (one of my favourite video-game characters) was bad in Fallout 4, same as the male voice actor. If you can make a competent voice actress like Courtney Taylor sound bad, then you have a huge problem with the dialogue of your game.-The only good character was Nick Valentine. He was a easy one to write, just a copy-pasted noir detective, but still I have to give props to Bethesda for including him.Last - The plot:-After the intro happens, you say ""I'll find whoever did this"", then 2 minutes after that you see a Cryolator Pistol locked in a case and says ""Nice! I'm coming back for you later!"". Then five minutes after that you find Codsworth and says ""B-but it's all... dead..."". Then five minutes later you are already cracking jokes (""SARCASTIC"" option in dialogue).-You are supposed to care about your family but you don't spend even 3 minutes with them. There is no bonding moment, nothing. The game forces you some strangers, say that they are your family and you're supposed to care.-No roleplaying possibility. You can either say yes, say yes in a sarcastic manner or says no that leads to the same thing as saying yes. No evil choices. Only flavours of saying yes.So I have to give the game a 1/10 because I liked Nick.",alicedupre

113090,Mass Effect 3,PC,0,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Good:1. Weapons upgrade system. 2. Getting squadmate's abilities.3. Umm, reaching here, but the war effort meter gave me some motivation to visit all the systems.Bad.1. Your choices in the previous games get retconned.2. The cover system is totally stupid and can get you killed if you just want to leap over an object.3, The space bar is the default interact button for everything (Blizzard is dumbing down their button schemes too to pander to casuals)4. The game will try and force you to go homosexual, freaking Garrus made a pass at me and wouldn't leave me alone! Cortez gets all emo on you and wants to hold hands with you every time you see him.5. More retcons: Ashley was a man? So where does that come out in the game? Oh it doesn't, it's just something a writer said in an interview later. 6. Stupid boss fights: Fight a giant Reaper dreadnought and blow it up solo when it takes a whole damn army and loads of missiles to blow one up in the final chapter. WTFPWN Leng in both both boss fight against him using shield drain and maxxed out inferno rounds.7. Stupid Ripped Off Ending: Instead of a stupid boss fight (which would have been preferable at this point) they give you a half an hour of UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES and then give you a choice of three endings which have no bearing on your progress in the game. Yeah, that was satisfying.8. DAY ONE DLC! Yeah, the greedy A-holes want to touch you up for another $10 after you already kickd them the $60. Good job EA.9. Stupid missions are all the same. Go in a base, kill a bunch of dudes that rush you. Collect data, mats, or some dude and get back to the ship. Timed missions have no timer. It doesn't matter, all of the missions are stupid easy.10. The exploration system got even more simplified so that 100% exploration can be achieved in about an hour.11. The War Resources Meter has no effect on the game. I freaking rescued the Volus Dreadnought, and I wanted to see it deployed in the final battle. It was no where to be seen. You liberate a bunch of viscous gangs for T'Lara for the war effort and it has absolutely no consequences. You also free T'Lara's murderous associate from jail and nothing negative happens after she swears to go on a killing spree. You don't even get in to any trouble with Bailey the head of C-Sec about it. Basically, nothing that isn't directly linked to the main story affects the game.12. I have a top of the line PC and the game graphics are crap. Artifacting and noise everywhere.13. The final encounter with the elusive man is a JOKE. Choose the renegade option or die and restart. LOL!!I played this game in order to complete the trilogy and make use of my game saves. The whole thing was a serious let down from the minute I saw the message about the day one DLC. All three endings that I had involved Shepard dying in some way and even though they attempted to give you some closure by talking to the characters on a vid screen before embarking on the last mission, it just felt empty and that the sacrifice was for nothing. If you are just learning about this series, just pass on it. It's not worth the investment as the experience degrades seriously as the game progresses from box to box.",Radzap

I loved the original and never played the remake on the game cube, so some of the areas are new to me and are a welcome addition. Some of the cut-scenes are grainy, but are not detrimental to the game experience. They are minor like the water draining or the credits at the end. The graphics are polished and the 3-D model characters are nice. The music is there as much as it is not, by that i mean it still has the areas where there is none. Just the sound of you walking, the storm outside, and sounds within the mansion.I would give the game an 8.5 if you have never experienced the control system and fixed cameras of RE 1 they present a learning curve, but the game offers a new control scheme that polishes the core controls. They have also added a difficulty level to the game which, depending on your selection, will generate more ammo and health while also making enemies weaker. They have also added stronger weapons in the game that were not in RE 1. I think I would have to be really picky about flaws considering the game is only 20 dollars. Overall the game is awesome to play and look at. Hopefully they will remaster the first 3 RE games, and release them for the same price. Great job Capcom this is one of the best decisions you have made in a while.",houdini66

However what it does is it cuts away the fat of games like Gran Turismo and Forza but not including things such as car customisation and having a much smaller selection of cars to race in providing much closer competition between racers both online and in singleplayer as you are racing exactly the same machines, no-one has an advantage and everyone is as likely to win as each other meaning its pure driving skill that determines whether you win a race or crash and burn in the gravel at the edge of the track. Though GRID is massivley smaller in terms of content compared to GT or Forza it will easily last you a good 20 hours for the singleplayer and even longer for the infinitely re-playable online modes. You must get known, make a team and earn a pro licence in all 3 regions (US, Europe and Japan) not to mention collect all the cars and sponsors.GRID is the perfect simulation racing game for someone who is perhaps not the biggest fan of sitting in menu's fine tuning every single minor detail of their ride yet still provides a satisfying and exhilarating experience for those that do like depth in their racers.",potatoes351

Unlike the other classic GTA characters, who were driven to continue by forces like a brother in prison (CJ) an angry mob boss who wants to kill you (Tommy) or an escape from prison(Claude), Nikko is constantly pushing ahead through his anger and lust for revenge. Not to mention that both of the endings were by far, some of the most disappointing conclusions I have ever experienced. This made me feel detached and unsympathetic for him. Not to mention that both of the endings were by far, some of the most disappointing conclusions I have ever experienced. The graphics are amazing, there is no mistake there, and the ambience is good as well, but the fact is that most of the music is unfamiliar to me and therefore takes away from the setting whereas the previous games had the late 20th century to help set the mood. The gameplay is also good, but I felt I was too sluggish and weighed down. The models relied too heavily on rag-doll physics and just weren't as believable as even the old school animations. The accuracy of the weapons started to become frustrating as well. Overall, the experience was not even CLOSE to the fun I had playing the first three GTA games and I hope that Rockstar realizes that they need to go back to the core story and setting elements that made the originals so epic.

On the contrary - batman features many mini-games and twists to keep you entertained. Rather, I was reminded of Fallout 3, and the interesting setting that emerges you into the game, makes you feel it, and identify with the main hero. The little elements like torn cape, and the ""Unshaved"" look, the spectacular elements that you ""discover"" by yourself - like gliding of the very tall building and realizing that it's pretty cool - all add to the experience. The story is not mind blowing, but it keeps you interested. The boss battles are just right to make you go ""Neat!"" and everything else just feels right. Even the length of the game, comparative short to some other similar styled games (Fallout3, Oblivion) - I feel is the right decision. Drag it on any longer, and the gameplay would become repetitive.

There are only four landable locations, the rest of the locations one only goes there once for a mission.

SuppressorsReview of PS3 Version:I actually played Black Ops the other day at my girlfriend's house on the 360 and it looked sharper, the colors were more vivid although the graphics are  not impressive, the PS3 version looks washed out and the sounds for each gun are terrible.Sounds:Guns are generic and indiscernable between an AK-47, Enfield, an M16 or a Skorpion submachine gun.  Suppressors make it sound like a paintball gun.  It's to the point where you feel like your weapon is underpowered all the while you can't tell them apart anyway in the battlefield.  For multiplayer, grenades sound like they got thrown into a basement which come off as muffled and unimpressive.Killstreaks sound effects like dogs, chopper gunner, etc. have good sound but the overall battlefield sounds take away from the fun and becomes really distracting  to people who regilarly played MW2 or BF:BC2.Graphics:Graphics were manageable but ugly in Multiplayer.  Whats worse is on the PS3 version, the combination of horrible online lag and fugly graphics make a COD as others said ""step backward"" from IW's MW2 last year.  Gameplay:Treyarch (the company that produced this year's COD game, last year Infinity Ward created Modern Warfare 2 for those whom may not know) made significant improvements (removed the tactical nuke, One Man Army, Commando, Tactical Insertion limited to team based games, Killstrak kills don't count towards Killstreak multiplier, etc.) in theory but the basic gameplay and fluid feel that we were used to in MW2 are non-existent.Treyarch includes Nazi Zombies, which was interesting but a good way to breakaway from playing MP and SP, added more customization allowing you to create your own emblem with pre made artwork and included new types of MP matches (Wager MAtch to gamble your earnings) but despite all the hype and granduer, it simply suffers from not being able to handle basic tasks as a fun shooter.For a game hyped as much as this, its a shame that Treyarch could not shake the negative perception of the quality of their games.  Any true hardcore gamer or even casual gamer can read past the glowing reviews from gaming sites that conveniently omit any of these major issues on the PS3.  The lag makes it impossible to line someone up in your sights to finish a kill, the maps are tiny, create lots of hiding spots for campers and are not conducive to snipers, graphics look sloppy/fugly and the sound of each gun is laughable for a game that set records...again!Bottom line:  I really want to try and enjoy this game.  All of the extra new features, Zombie Nazis, the Cold War feel of the SP, cleaning up the cheap tactics from MW2 and improving the MP experience but I can not convince myself that this is a game worth my hard earned money.I played this game until I reached level 21 in MP and regret I even decided to go that far.I first got into playing FPS online with my PS3 playing COD4 MW but it seems like Infinity Ward has more polish, ingenuity and skill at making games for the COD series.",ChuckWoolery

There are an incredible amount of side-quests available, and the game rewards you for doing them by giving you some assistance in regards to Weapons and Abilities - which is quite useful when playing through the Main Storyline on a Harder difficulty setting. The artistic style is better than it has ever been, resulting in a very colorful game, and pretty much everything except Character Modification, Crib Customization and Clothing is broader than previous installments. Technically the game is very impressive as well, not needing an Aim-Assist system like GTA IV due to the frame-rate being more consistent. The developers at Volition have also learned a thing or two (or 50?) from GTA IV such as revamped controls, as well as adding alternate story lines. The lack of a cover-system is somewhat disappointing though, but the game is designed with run-and-gun in mind, so it still holds up quite well. Furthermore, The Third has many surprising and funny moments, and the writers went to great lengths to surprise and amuse the player constantly with its non-realistic and bizarre narrative. When it comes down to it though, what truly differentiates it from the GTA series is the pacing of the game, and how you start of from the top and get powerful weapons and gadgets early on. And the Awesome Button, which allows you to do things like jump through the front window of a car to steal it is just ridiculous - being a fine example of a game that does not take itself too seriously. In addition Volition has some intuitive moments, making an in-game GPS system with arrows inside the world of where to turn, which is something even Rockstar should take into account for GTA V. Unfortunately however, and similarly to the prequel, The Season Pass DLC is again way overpriced, costing as much as the game itself. In conclusion, Saints Row: The Third is a lot of fun to play, and for sheer entertainment value, I'm sure it will hit many gamers' soft-spots for that very reason. Though maybe some of the effort that went into making weird gadgets and weapons, should have been used making a longer and more fulfilling storyline.",zotune

Now don't get me me wrong, this game fighting and animations are top notch. Along with great voice acting and lines that never feel out of place for the character. Now that being said the Arcade mode feels so watered down and each character ending are two  panels...Two...Panels...now i know they did this back in MVC2 which is fine but you would think after having multiple other games before hand doing actual ending cutscenes but no i guess they figure ""Eh we can shovel the same crap we did last time and the players will still buy it"". Not to mention these two panels aren't even engaging or worth while to see. They're all just ""x"" character causally talking to ""Insert B-List opposite Franchise"". They had Dante fighting Deadpool or Magento  and Wesker fighting X-23 and Chris in the trailers, but they couldn't expand on that at all. Anyway out of Arcade mode you only have ""Versus"" which is a two player match which should be given. A ""Training mode"" which is you playing against a bot or what i like to call a punching bag and lastly ""Mission mode"" which is a horrible done ""How to play the game mode"". So in this mode you pick a character from a panel that separates Marvel and Capcom characters,nothing to bad but then you get to the stage and it's just a indicator saying attack with ""The attack name"". It doesnt tell you how to do the attack like in so many and i mean so many fighting games before it just says attack with ""Attack Name"". Of course this forces you to constantly pause the game look back and check through the command list and search for the moves, something  that will get so aggravating once you pass maybe the second or third mission of most characters.Now let me tell you the most aggravation part of this whole game. It''s not the poorly done Acrade and Mission mode, nor is it the lack of stages, the lack fan favorite characters for barely known and disliked characters (Who the  wanted MODOK). It wasn't even the most lackluster gallery mode. It's Online,  online. Nothing in my lifetime so far has pissed me off like the online in this game. Not only does its ""fail join a game"" comes up nearly every time you hit ranked match and kicks you back to the main menu screen instead trying to auto search again like in many games before, but the rank match itself should come with an Ironic  tag to it. Not only do you constantly get ranked with people way higher/lower than your rank but it's also filled with Sentinel spamming noobs (press down and ""Hard button"" to win while constantly calling your partners). Now of course there's that or player match which takes forever to match me up with someone, so if you need to do your taxes/homework/ or balance your life savings you got that. Lastly they have a lobby mode where its just you waiting in ""line"" to fight one person and get kicked back in the back  and wait again once you realized the  is using Sentinel. And that's it...no tournament mode, no spectate mode just nothing else....nothing. Thanks for wasting your moneyOverall: This game is a fun fighting game at times and the animation and the effect will have you entertain until you realized how broken and unfinished/pololish this game really is.

Furthermore, the added multiplayer component was the part I was most anxious to see before release as it's a very different concept to other multiplayer games and in that sense was either going to be awesome or a flop. Fortunately, it was executed excellently and provides a very enjoyable experience, despite the issues with slow matchmaking and a fairly low level cap. Overall, as an expansion Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is excellent and well worth the money even for just the single player campaign but the multiplayer helps add a new dimension and greater longevity.",DomF

This gives it a different, yet similar play style as DOTA 2 and League of Legends, but the game play is faster, and you have to aim your attacks, making the learning curve slightly steeper than other games in the genre. The third-person aspect of the game allows for many flanks and ganks, putting you directly into the battle at all times. The playable characters are Gods from multiple different pantheons, which currently consist of Greek, Norse, Roman, Egyptian, Chinese, Hindu, and Mayan with hopefully more to come. There are currently 70 Gods overall and each player starts with five free Gods: Neith, Thor, Guan Yu, Ra, and Ymir. The rest of the Gods can be purchased using in-game currency that is earned by simply playing the game, or they can be purchased with gems that cost real currency. The game also offers the Ultimate God Pack which contains every God currently out, and all Gods that come out in future updates. The pack only costs $30 US, so it is very worth the cost.There are five different classes that each God is under based on their abilities; these classes are: Mage, Assassin, Warrior, Guardian, and Hunter. Mages have magical based attacks, and generally are ranged, they also generally have low health, and high damage/support. Hunters have physical based attacks, and are almost always ranged, they generally have low health, and are your Attack Damage Carry, or ADC for short. Warriors have physical based attacks, and are melee, they generally have medium to high health, but have medium to low damage. Assassins have physical based attacks, and are melee, they have very low health, but high damage. Guardians have magical based attacks, some are ranged, and some are melee, they have very high health, and generally low damage.Smite consists of six game modes: Conquest, Joust, Arena, Assault, Siege, and the Match of the Day, or MotD for short. Conquest is your normal 5v5 MOBA style map, consisting of a jungle, three lanes, each with two towers per team, and a phoenix per team. The objective is to destroy the opponentâs Titan which is in the enemy base. Joust is a 3v3 map, consisting of a jungle, one tower per team, and one phoenix per team, the objective is to destroy the opponentâs Titan. Arena is a 5v5 team death match map. The goal is to deplete the opponentâs tickets, which start at 500; five tickets are taken off for every player kill, one ticket is taken off if your team gets the final hit on an enemy minion (Note that if your minions kill an enemy minion, no points are deducted), one point is taken off if one of your minions enter the enemy portal, and 15 points are taken off if a siege minion enters the enemy portal. Assault is a 5v5 map, consisting of one lane, no jungle, two towers per team, one phoenix per team, and you cannot recall, or walk back onto the fountain, and the objective is to destroy the enemy titan. God selection is random. Siege is a 4v4 map, consisting of two lanes and a middle jungle. Each lane has two towers per team, and a phoenix each per team, the objective is to destroy the enemy titan. The MotD is random, and changes daily, so be sure to check in every day to see what it is.The item system is similar to that of other games in the genre, consisting of Consumables, Actives, and Passives. For the first few games of Smite, play with the Auto-Buy and Auto-Level option on, the game will then make your God a basic item build. Once you are use to the God, you can go into the God Builder section, and create an item build, and ability build, so while Auto-Buy is on, it will by the items you preset. Sometimes youâll need to adapt your build based on the enemy team, so donât be shy to turn off Auto-Buy in the middle of a game to change your build to fit the scenario.",Blackclaw185

However I felt it was far more like the Onimusha series with elements of Souls game. Regardless of its influence, it's great and manages to be it's own thing too.Visually the set pieces are fantastically detailed yet some of the stages were a tad too dark. The camera angle was also irritating at times, often not adjusting properly or positioning itself in poor spots  hampering combat at times.While I like loot based games, Nioh kind of went overboard. You get too much of it too quickly and too much variety making the crafting and fusing systems almost redundant for most of the first playthrough. Only in NG+ does it calm down to more manageable frequency.Combat is allot of fun and gets better once you find the weapon you like the most (personally, I like the lance the most.) However it can get a bit repetitive oce you have a high level character with all skills unlocked. Spamming strong combos can become a thing. Also to note that unlike the Souls games, this game is not difficult, in fact it can be too easy allot of the time. What this game does is punishes carelessness and reckless behaviour. If you don't pay attention to what's going on and your environment you will die. But keep your eyes open and be careful, and the game will be a breeze.Overall:Nioh is a worthy competitor to the Souls, but still needs a bit more polish in some areas to be what it could be. I hope Nioh 2 learns and improves on this.",Rox22

It doesn't matter if your team locks down a corridor, or section of the map, the enemy will just appear right behind you since the game actively avoid forward spawns.Aside from those two problems, I have a personal problem with the map layouts... They are way to cluttered with obstacles.  Therefore, shotguns and SMGs rule king.  I have no problem with these guns, I just wish the 90% of the maps didn't favor them as I do enjoy AR's.It's sad to say that MW2 is still the best in series, and I'm sure many would still play it if it wasn't for all the hackers.",Breaker_Ki

I had never played Doom 3 till now and the first thing I noticed is that the graphics although not great, are still remarkably good even in today's standards. Furthermore the lighting effects from the flash light helped make the game look great and an all more fun experience when entered into rooms of pure darkness. The gameplay for Doom 3 is solid with a nice variety of weapons and enemies. As you get further into the game you will find yourself picking up new weapons and being entered into a cutscene to introduce a new mob you will be fighting throughout the game. The weapons themselves are great however I found myself only sticking to a minority of weapons due the play through since some were greatly more powerful and efficient than others. The enemies in Doom 3 are somewhat unique in there own ways and provide an enjoyable experience throughout the game as you learn how to avoid their attacks and learn their weaknesses however I found some enemies to be impossible to get around such as the mini gun enemies which give no opportunity to avoid getting damaged. Bonuses such as collecting PDA's is a nice touch in Doom as it allowed you to search through peoples PDA's to unlock bonuses in the game and find items earlier. This also increased the urge to explore as it would benefit you hugely as you progressed through a level. The occasion encounters of bosses are OK (except the final boss) and I found myself defeating the bosses on the first try on the medium difficulty which shows the lack of skill required since I usually just found myself spamming a rocket launcher in the bosses faces. Whilst the bosses do look cool, they didn't seem to do much other than run at you and smack you in the face or throw balls of poison, fire or whatever at you. For example in the final boss I found myself kiting the boss around in circles firing a launcher and another weapon for about 5 minutes. In general the level design is good however I found myself not knowing where to go and a lack of indication of where to go which in some ways I agree is good as it allows the game to seem less linear and allow for exploration, however are a few minutes or wandering around cluelessly it does get a little frustrating. The levels towards the end also to me became repetitive and spawning of enemies became extremely predictable. However there are some issues which I really did not like about Doom 3. The lack of an auto save feature. As you get really immersed into the game and die, you find yourself having to repeat half a level because of no autosave even in cut scenes or in boss encounters. Secondly were the small things such as dieing because a door closed when you were standing between it which I thought was unnessary. Finally I found the story was extremely weak which to be honest I don't really care about however a good storyline would have been a nice touch. In short Doom 3 is a fun action packed shooter and will have you always needing to be aware as mobs spawn in all directions as you progress though a level. The campaign is at a fine length, graphics are acceptable in today's standards and in general is longer than most of the latest FPS releases. However the lack of exciting bosses, predictable repetitive enemies, minor frustrating game elements and repetitive maze like levels really held the game back from getting a higher score than 7 in my eyes. The war between the 2004 FPS hits Half Life 2 and Doom 3 leads me to declare that Half Life 2 won this little battle however Doom 3 is still a great game and if given the opportunity, you should give Doom 3 a go.",DeadlyCheese

The Though I have disliked ""rpg's"" with AI-controlled helpers from the beginning, I consider it a necessary evil nowadays, so let's not go there. The biggest surprise to me was the phenomenal Character dialog. I found my self laughing out loud on some totally unexpected reactions and the likeability of the supporting cast. Much better than, for example, the Dragon Age: Origins. The plot was a letdown: although, there was more to it than in the first installation of the series, it didn't matter. The things you did on your ""freetime"" didn't really affect the plot or its outcome and the critical storymoment were far and wide. At some point (while mining an asteroid, a dreary job at best) I started to wonder, what I was expected to do, anyways? It's nice not to have a leash around your neck, but a little nudge to the right direction for now and then wouldn't hurt. Combat in the first Mass Effect was dodgy at best, but you could do it relying on your shields or taking cover behind something. It the number 2, shields have no meaning: they're just a healthbar and when they're gone, you are going to die unless there's time to regenerate, behind a chest-high-wall. This I hated a lot. Why they had to adopt the Gears of War coversystem? Ok, it might be a good thing for the consolegeneration, but it really doesn't work on PC. The battles are dull. You cannot control your surroundings when you are glued to the wall and sometimes, when you can see everything from your cover, popping-up and shooting limits your view to a wall and another wall. This was horrid, and I thought for a time to quit playing for this sad reason. The combat does have some improvements to the earlier installation. The hits have more impact and there is a slight chance of tactical thinking and ""curving-the-bullet"" with superpowers. Also, I miss the chaos of the first ME's inventory. Ok, there were a ****load of guns and gadgets, but you learned to pick out the best and scrap and sell the rest, plus upgrading and customizing weapons and armor was fun! In ME2, the whole inventory is forgotten, replaced by few guns with slightly different abilities, only Shepard can customize his armor and there's ammoclips for the weapons. What was wrong with the overheating of the first ME? It was rather original, and after playing through it first ME, the ME2 clips felt like a downgrade (which it was) to a OK combat and Sci-fi scenario. The new heavy weapons could have had this option, but there was nothing to be gained by implementing this idea to the normal weapons. The only reason I can see for the down-grade is that it's easier for a standard FPS-player to adapt to the reloading of guns than waiting them to cooldown after being overheated with impunity. The second reason must be that the progarammers wanted people to rely more on their superpowers in battle (which do look nice), for as I remember while playing ME1, I didn't do as much because good weapons. Hoping the third instalment of ME isn't ""the X-Men in space"". But in overall, I enjoyed the game. It wasn't a groundbreaking gamegod, which the hype suggested, but a nicely written moviegame, nerfeddown to fit consoles. It is an episodegame, so if you haven't played the first Mass Effect, you're going to miss out quite lot of puns and dialog for not really knowing, what happened ""in the past"".",TomiN

Some might not like the changes, I never said it was perfect, so you might have your reason to hate it, but if you like a good hack and slash, with a good story, a good cooperative play, ecc... then you might like Diablo. I read reviews talking about how they copied the skills from WoW as the worse thing ever happened , but in the end does the name of a skill really matters? Other say that the character customization lacks depth, I say that it does IF you don' t want it to be deep. To be able to change set of skills right before a Boss is a good thing, I suppose, while D2 players had to delete a character whenever their set of skills was wrong, while now the real customization is in the equipment . The gold based auction house is a good (WoW inspired) new feature, even thou the real money one isn' t  that good. Pay for win should remain in the free-to-play games, where it belongs. As for the maps, some might complain, but they are randomly generated, so if you play twice the game you'll still find new dungeons, even new secondary quests.

One thing i'd like to address asap that I noticed about low score reviews on here, is that they really, REALLY dislike the animations of your characters during fighting, and think of it as clunky. well, fun fact, that's because its SUPPOSED to be. unlike your typical multi-weapon based game, weapons in MH:W aren't made of paper and plastic and you can't just fling a sword thrice as big as you like it doesn't weigh anything. battles are HECTIC, with environmental traps and places to use a grappling hook for quick mobility, and at all times during a battle you'll be thinking on your feet. However, this game isn't a hack-and-slash where you can just button mash and expect things to die, you have to plan your strikes(and positioning if you're using a ranged weapon) before you make them or you'll be punished for attacking in the wrong way at the wrong time. Bows for example let you run around pretty well and let you stay agile, while a lance-and-shield will make you extremely sluggish but will allow you to take extremely minimal damage while blocking, and I LOVE this system, to many games I have played where you can just button mash and things die without even being in the Hack-And-Slash genre, its refreshing to play this.The maps look beautiful and vibrant, and of course, so do the monsters! speaking of the monsters, I found the adaptive AI really awesome, especially during a few instances so far of 1 monster attacking another monster I'm currently fighting, which is something that is completely unscripted.Now, I do have some gripes with the game, Which is why im not giving it a 10, which, I agree with low score reviews, the game is pretty poorly optimized. I have a 1070Ti (overclocked as high as I could take it safely I might add) with a Ryzen 2700x OC'd CPU, and this game still can not reliably hit 60 fps without me turning some settings down a little unless I'm in a very open area without a lot of density, or i'm in non-busy floors of the main hub area. during gameplay I'm looking at around 50-65 fps with lows as bad as 40, but, highs reaching the high 70's. Hopefully some patches get released that will get this game ""unchugged"".I also don't enjoy the lack of depth to character creation, but I understand that certain aspects (such as size and body type) could cause some issues of game balance if they were to have immersive gameplay effects such as someone overweight moving slower than a fit body type, or a short character being much harder for the monsters to hit if their hitbox was also reduced to fit their height.all in all, the game so far is very enjoyable for me, and as someone that's always been on the low end hardware side of life for the last 20 or so years, and only just now finally getting a beefy PC, turning down a few settings to get the game at a stable 60 frames isn't the end of the world for me. on a completely unrelated note, I did notice some people saying the Co-op is unstable. I've done a LOT of hunts so far, and with those, I did the majority single-player, I will admit to that. However every single multiplayer session i've done has had no issues whatsoever, but, I'm, speaking for myself, I'd say try the game out, try to rush through the tutorial as fast as you can with the default character model(you can have up to 3 character profiles at once and can just delete the profile after) so you can do the multiplayer as soon as possible to see if it gives you issues. if you enjoy the game when doing your first quest tutorial, and there are no problems with multiplayer, delete that profile or just begin a new game and take your time with that profile, and have fun :)",ZePieMan

173053,Tomb Raider,Xbox360,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        So a new Tomb Raider game. TR is indeed a reboot but also a prequel, I think. At the start of the game it really reminds me of Far Cry 3, because Lara and her friends have been kidnapped by pirates or something. When you finally get Bow and go off to the forest, you might think: Now this reminds me of AC3 because I have a bow and an axe and a pistol, but however the glitches in TR are so annoying that it toke me a whole week until I could continue the story, the glitch was a huge problem. Now the graphics in TR good especially for the PC, the multiplayer not as good. The villain in TR is really good, because you don't think that he would be a bad guy and try to kill you and your friends. TR is really enjoyable but I doubt it is the best game of 2013. 8/10",PatrykG

The bosses are great but there are so few of them that you have to fight the same ones to get materials for the really god items.

It is too high for what the game is.Another thing about other reviews is they keep mentioning how terrible the graphics are, when that's the point. This game wasn't meant to look AMAZING. And if people can't see that, then they shouldn't have bought it in the first place, because it was obvious just looking at the games store page how it would look.Back to my own review, I for one think the graphics are exactly what they were meant to be, and it looks good.The long and short of it is, this game is not for people who buy high end computers so they can run games like Crysis 2 flawlessly.

For people, like myself, who only got into the series recently with Yakuza 0 and Kiwami, you will be lost for a vast majority of the game. I was very disappointed that a brand new cast joined Kiryu in his final game in the series. There's hardly mention of series favorites like Majima or other characters of the like. The story also ends on a very meh note. While it certainly picks up towards the end, the story as a whole wasn't as good previous games. Not even Beat Takeshi himself could keep this story from just being average at best.That's all a shame as this is the first game in the series to update the main overworld and the stuff in it. From that aspect, it's great. Kamurocho has never been prettier and it's actually fun to walk around town and find new stuff to get into. However, the substories here are prob the worst of the series from the games I've played. There's not as much of the craziness that these games are known for here in this one as compared to the past. The side stuff you can do ranges from a very well done baseball sim to a clan fighting creator that kinda missed the mark. I just wished that the game that took the Yakuza series into the new generation of consoles, (because this game techincally came out in '16) would have done more with Kiryu's final story then what ended up happening. Especially since it was just starting to gain popularity in the west. While Kiwami 2 will keep Kiryu in the spot light, it almost would have been better for the series to have started from scratch with Yakuza 7, especially in the west. As it stands, the Yakuza series should be very well off going forward into the future. This is just a bad game for people who are only familiar with the 0 and Kiwami games to play. Because there's a ton that people are missing by not playing the 4 games from Kiwami to this one. For those who have been with the series since the original dubbed version on PS2, congrats. To the other 95% of westerns playing this game, it's a big realization that we missed out on a great series for years because it was mainly intended for Japanese audiences.",Kenmei

Be prepared to mess with the settings until you find a proper display setting - it seems the 'autodetect' settings break the display sometimes. Once the initial irritation of the graphics issues was overcome, I made it a few hours into the campaign before getting very bored. It's just fetch-quests, interspersed with regular building tutorials.

You just freely build a city according to some requirement (like get 2500 citizens etc), which is fun for a while. Developing a pretty looking metropolis is satisfying, it's just all a bit soulless. Personality is sorely lacking, which is a shame because the presentation is great.

However, I can tell you that you should treat this like hardcore fans of a band. Sometimes, in the music business, you have to change the recipe just a little - and this is where all the hardcore fans rage and call the bands sellouts. This is ""the case"" with Saints Row 3. People whoHardcore fans of the series will tell you that this game is a huge letdown, and you should not buy it. However, I can tell you that you should treat this like hardcore fans of a band. Sometimes, in the music business, you have to change the recipe just a little - and this is where all the hardcore fans rage and call the bands sellouts. This is ""the case"" with Saints Row 3. People who played the previous games hate SR3, because it's changing the recipe, takes some risks and this doesn't fit in the happy world of a fanboy. I haven't played any of the previous Saints Row games, and after taking a look at videos and taking up a lot of reading about the previous Saints Row games, I'm not going to pick them up, because they look horrible to me. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the original SR games were slum-based gangfights and nothing stylish, random, or funny. A ""even-more-low-life-version"" of GTA so to speak. The GTA series has a style that portrays you as a low-life criminal, but not enough for it to be annoying.With that said, people seem to think a major problem with Saints Row 3 is the style - in the words of Johnny Gat: ""We traded our dicks in for **** - the Saints are celebrities and have their own bloody stores and movies. This is a plus for me, because it's wack enough to make sense. It has a lot of awkward ""random girl lol so funneh"" jokes, but most of them actually work well with how the characters are, and how the setting is. Bottom-line is - It's a great game. Don't listen to ""Saints Row Veterans"" as they came here expecting a low-life criminal shootdown, but got a prestige rich-mans gang with purple neon and a city that's just waiting to get **** - and this turned them off.It is not without its problems though. Now and then, the streets are empty - you turn your camera angle back and forth, and suddenly there's life everywhere. There are some issues with the plot, that left me wondering if I missed something like a cutscene, but the whole thing is still going to make sense - there are just some bits of the story that you hear about in dialogue, that makes you wonder why this wasn't a big deal with a cutscene and so forth.The BIGGEST issue is the story missions. Far too many of these only serve as a ""beginner's version"" of the activities around Steelport, which means the actual story elements are casually ignored just to get you into the action. I found this a bit awkward. My last issue would be characters, specifically Shaundi. She appears to be a very important character in Saints Row, yet the developers don't focus on her at all. She's a main character in the first few missions, and then she's practically gone for the rest of the story, which is weird when she becomes a HUGE part in the later missions - the game doesn't explain why you should care about her - Only SR veterans will know why. The game runs well, there's a distinct style and there's a lot to do around Steelport. Aiming is smooth and there's many fun hours to be had. As a closing comment, I'll say: Treat this game as a stand-alone title. Forget that it's a part of a series, and you'll have a blast. All you need to know is fairly well hinted throughout dialogue, meaning you don't have to know anything about the Saints, at all, to enjoy the game.",Suchaku

I recall being a 13 year old playing the original and being absolutely terrified which when watching the youtube videos of the original release is laughable. It also reminded me of just how much better my 13 year old self was at playing games. Either I've adapted to change and play the new age controlled games differently, or I've just become far too comfortable with an unlimited backpack, infinite saves and 360 degree movement with the added bonus of being able to strafe the hell out of the way of thingsFirst things first. Resident Evil is as terrifying today to my 31 year old reasonably brave fully grown legally adult self as it was was back in the 90's. The lighting and sound of the HD remake is great, meaning a flash of lightning can result in unimaginable terror at the zombie creature staring at you through the window, only to realise a moment later that it's just your reflection.The backpack system, although frustrating at times, adds to the strategy of whether or not to load up on medicinal items, keys and artifacts for the next puzzle room, leaving you incredibly vulnerable to an attack, or just keeping yourself armed to the teeth to dispose of the next undead creature who decides that you're a running all you can eat buffet. Annoyingly, the canteen of petroleum takes up a slot and can only be used twice before requiring a refill, so that makes the pant-messing crimson head zombies that you've created even more of an annoyance given the fact that I opted to leave my flammable flask tucked away in the last safe box that I hooked up with.In addition to the sound and lighting, the old camera angles make for an increased fright where upon entering a room you're left with hardly any view and just the moans and groans of a zombie aware of your presence but leaving you completely in the dark as to where he is. Make a move forward and find he's in your face, or opt for aiming your gun from your entry position and wait forever only to find that he's further on down the corridor and is infact completely unaware of your presence. I opted for the latterMaybe it was nostalgia that gave this a 9, but overally for the low pricetag, classic survival horror experience and decent replay value with another character I'm hoping that this remaster has done well enough to justify a release of my personal favourite, Resident Evil 2",KungFoo83

This would be tolerable if the rest of the game was worth it, but the shooting aspect of the game just feels like busywork.

The campaign is no better or worse than previous COD and is nice and all the main point of this game is the great multiplayer. The best thing about call of duty black ops is the weapon ranges and the character building also there is a lot different matches such as a wage match which lets you play the game in multiplayer mode but the downside to this kind of match is if someone knifes you in the back the all your money that you have earned  goes to that player in this type of game it learns you to be quick on your feet with the player also be very stealth and you also have to watch your back as you could get stabbed this game gives a lot of qualities out to other people. This game is rated 9/10 because of everything it has this game can be quite addicting after you have played it once there is another type of match and that is death match this is when you and another team has to shoot each other you can either be red or blue more people you kill more points you get but if you kill 1 after 1 then it is called a strike and you can get prizes such as a helicopter or some type.",FCHOUDHRY10

The first thing is, they didn't just copy/paste BC2 in every way bar the levels, and try sell it as a new game. This alone should get it 5 points, as it's main competitor in the FPS market does just that; so striving to be different and create innovation in the way of a new gaming engine defines it higher up the ladder than its main competitor by default.Now I know this game has never been sold on its singleplayer component, and you can tell this whilst playing the restricted single player that comes with the game. It feels like the designers threw it in there to satisfy those who would complain if it wasn't there, not to win awards with amazing single player story arc design or plot progression. Sure it has big set-pieces ala CoD and amazing vistas and beautiful graphics, but its things like the extremely un-needed quicktime sequences thrown in at every corner that really made me cringe whilst playing the campaign. I bought this knowing it was multiplayer based beforehand, and bought it as a multiplayer game, but all the same, this is a reason why I can't give it a 10, it's not quite the perfect package... quite.The core part of the package then... the multiplayer. With an unlock system close to the BF's of old, with a few extras thrown in,  the unlock system will keep you playing for hours more than you intended too. No stupid kill-streak bonuses here, just hard work to get fair rewards. With unlocks for each type of vehicle, weapon and class there is plenty to unlock, along with the visual additions gained (new camo etc) by the core account levelling process that slowly levels up by collating all points gained as you play - there really is a lot of stuff here to add to the already awesome multiplayer experience.The battlefields range from the hugely wide open area of ""Caspian Border"" to the confined train station setting within ""Metro"", each level adds something different and requires different approaches from a tactical standpoint, making each game you play guaranteed to be different. The vehicles add the feel of warfare across all maps that have them, and can be extremely deadly in the right hands.That's the thing with this game, nothing really feels unfair or unbalanced. Sure if you're getting owned by an attack helicopter, jump in an AA gun and go blow him/her out of the sky, or get working on flying your own Helicopter to better him/her. At first you may fail, but after a bit of work you will be the one people will be clambering into AA's to take down, or grabbing anti tank gear to take you out due to the immense destruction you are causing. And the good thing is, when you do get taken out, it's normally because you missed something or didn't react quick enough, not because some dude was in an AC130 dominating you with no chance to respond. With the different game modes like Conquest, Rush, Team Deathmatch and Squad Rush the multiplayer really is a big beast to bite into, and has something for every fps player. Along with the fun, but short, co-op, this game really is worth the price its asking for.If it only wasn't for Origin I may have given it a 9...",metaphase

The enemy's can provide a few scares early on in the game, but you soon find yourself attacked by the hundredth fishman/lumberjack zombie and the effect is lost.

There are only a handful of different enemies and very few unique environments the player can interact with, which reduces the gameplay into a pretty tedious grind.A unique part of the gameplay is shining a torch (flashlight) on enemy prior to being able to damage them. However, you are rarely attacked by large numbers and are almost always provided with enough ammo and flares to easily keep out of trouble. Both player and enemies move slowly, and most combat takes place in an open environment, so backing away from enemies is an effective but boring tactic.The story is reasonably interesting, but it evolves slowly and is so ""cheesy"" it is hard to take seriously. All the characters in the game are extremely unlikable, and seem like they were designed by a child. This reduces motivation to progress through the game, as the only real reward for the gameplay is plot progression.Graphics and sound are generally impressive, but viewpoint is frustrating and not really suited for mouse control. The character controls are quite clumsy, and the dodging mechanic isn't really very useful (avoiding enemies is far more effective).",fasad

After sinking days and days of playtime online on COD4, and WaW. And having sunk about 2 days into MW2 and MW3 online player and frankly hated it, i had no idea what to expect for BLOPS 2 (IAfter MW3, I bought black ops 2 with the ideal that I might actually just end up playing the single player and selling it back after i'd been killed 100 times in one game in the online multiplayer. After sinking days and days of playtime online on COD4, and WaW. And having sunk about 2 days into MW2 and MW3 online player and frankly hated it, i had no idea what to expect for BLOPS 2 (I thought BLOPS 1 was a great game). However, the online multiplayer on BLOPS 2 in all honesty saves the game. But first the story mode: It would be too harsh to say the story mode was a complete disaster, but really, it comes nowhere close to any of the other call of duties. There are no 'stand out missions'. The strike force missions and clunky and hard to use, and it lacks real emotion and a good soundtrack which in my opinion has made some of the games like COD4 and Waw whose sountracks cement those good moments of gameplay into your mind forever. I'd give the single player 4/10, 2 of those points coming for the impressive cutscenes preceeding the missions, some of the cinematics really are good but dont let that shadow the missions which really lack any substance. As for zombies, im underwhelmed, the maps are bad, with fire all over the floor so you can be running away from zombies and suddenly find yourself downed because you stood over a crack with flames coming out, which span the entirity of the map. But i guess you should decide for yourself. The muliplayer? It was average for me until i found the FAL DSW, its a great gun, and has the old school, classic, 3-shot body kill that was in COD4 and hasnt reutrnined since, I think no cod games will be good again until default damage is 3 hit kill, all of the round ending kill cams are of a filthy, over used, SMG probably with a silencer spraying about 15 bullets around the general area of someone without any real precision.

It was like, yea this game might not be some perfect sphere of nirvana like Half-Life 2 or anything, but it's an innovative new game concept that really tried to breathe new life into the FPS genre, so why not give it the benefit of the doubt? Who else would think to take EA's bags of money and make a first person parkour game that almost totally avoids combat? That is the creation of either some madness, or some genius.So it came out and I started playing it. And frankly, I dunno why giantbomb gave it a 3/5. This game is **** fun. The sense of speed and adenaline from running over rooftops while sliding under pipes and walljumping from scaffolding is just amazing. That's what this game excels at, making you feel like an amazing athlete, some sort of freak Olympian who gets their kicks from stealing stuff and running away. The parkour is easily accomplished with the controls and viewing it from first person makes it much more immersive then a traditional third person camera would have.The entire game has a nice sorta Ipod-ish aesthetic. It seems that in the city of the future, everything is clean and white, with some splashes of other colors. If you've ever watched the turd of a film called ""Ultraviolet"", then you'll recognize its look here. Very sterilized and cold... even the plants in the city are painted white for some reason heh. I suppose it's a new take on the futuristic city aesthetic though, compared to a lot of stuff in scifi games that're just ripped off from Blade Runner and Aliens.So while I'm enjoying the game a lot, there are a few caveats. First off, I started playing the game last night. At the end of the session, I had completed the first four levels. There are nine levels in all. Yes, this game is not built for longevity. It is short. And no multiplayer, so all that's left is doing speed runs in the completed levels to try to top your last time. Obviously a factor if you're gonna go and buy this game for 60 bucks or whatever.The combat's also lacking, since this isn't a game where you're meant to run and gun. You can use guns, but you have to first disarm a cop. Then, you'll only be able to shoot until the magazine runs out, you can't reload. So shooting it out isn't really encouraged. Also, your character Faith can only take a few shots, so you'll definitely need to run behind cover and wait for opportune moments to strike. If you do work at it, you can shoot it out with a SWAT team though. Just isolate one guy, disarm him, run to another guy, shoot him, grab his gun, and repeat, while trying not to catch too much lead. It's not ideal, and it's certainly much harder then just running for any exit, but it's doable. The hand to hand combat works for the weak police, they'll drop after 2 or 3 punches. But the SWAT guys in armor will just push you away, so hand to hand doesn't work on them. All in all, if you're looking for some sorta Matrix-style martial arts combat to match the game's parkour gameplay, you won't find it here.Oh, and yea... the game cutscenes do resemble the Esurance cartoon commercials. But honestly... I always liked those commercials. Erin Esurance was hot. So that's not really a complaint for me.",Delta_Assault

I think in several places it manages to out-CoD CoD, which can be either good or bad depending on your perspective.  Sadly, there are a LOT of bugs that I've run into, like having guns completely disappear and having to use the dot on my screen to aim, or constant errors and crashing on the Singapore Strait level.  For a console game, even a release day console game, this is absolutely unacceptable.Multiplayer I'm still getting the hang of.  I'm basing this mainly off my experiences on PC as PSN was down and buggy for much of release day.  The unlock systems feel a little awkward, as it's not a clear 'do this get this' progression anymore.  As you do stuff with, say, an assault class, you earn points toward unlocking assault stuff, while if you use an assault rifle, you earn points toward new assault rifles, and if you use a particular assault rifle, you get points for attachments for that assault rifle.  That means if you're healing or reviving people, you'll get assault score and XP for levels, but not new attachments or guns.  There is some randomness involved with battlepacks, which contain paint schemes and unique attachments, and I'm hoping against all hope EA doesn't decide to monetize this (who am I kidding).Graphics on the PS4 are decent enough for 'next gen', but are not anywhere as eyepopping as they are on the PC, and of course, the controls are a bit clunky though the Dualshock 4 is really, really nice compared to the 3.So, bottom line is it's an enjoyable experience HOWEVER the PS4 version has a lot of bugs to work through.  If you haven't already bought it with the bundle, I would recommend waiting a month or so for the bugs to get fixed.  Once they do, I will revisit my score here.",Necrotaur

If you enjoyed playing Minecraft  and would like to relive the 8-bit side-scroller days, then you should check out Terraria.  It starts you off a little more friendly by providing you with the basic tools for you to start mining and building your shelter. (Pick, Axe, Sword, Hammer)  Once you've gathered some materials, you can scroll thru the very easy list of items that you can craft.  Just that like Minecraft, you don't know how to make anything more without checking the Wiki page for all the crafting recipes.  Once you've got your house built correctly, you'll have NPC's start moving into the rooms you've built.

They stay with you forever until you sell them.-----Cons:There's zero tutorial built into the game in order for you to learn how to play and advance, despite there being an NPC Guide for you to talk to.

With so many games focusing on surviving against zombies, it can be hard to pick any good games from the crowd. But with Left 4 Dead, I believe all other games have just been blown out of the water. In L4D, you play as one of four survivors- Bill, Francis, Zoey, or Louis. Each has their own little back story and their own personality, something that helps you connect. Like Francis, who hates stairs, helicopters, zombies, walking, and generally anything and everything. There are multiple campaigns in the game, each with a different set of locales and atmospheres. Like the first campaign, No Mercy, which has you moving through a city to rendezvous on a hospital skyscraper rooftop. Each campaign is broken into chapters, which have you getting from the start area to a safehouse. At the last chapter, you face a thing called a finale, where you get a bunch of supplies, an area to hole out in, and a trigger to start it. When you activate the trigger, a massive horde of zombies rush at you. And the game features a ""Director,"" who controls how the chapter is going. For example, you might hole out in a parking lot in one area and defend against a wave of zombies using gas canisters in one playthrough, and maybe the next the canisters won't be there and the zombies will come from behind. And killing zombies in this game is FUN. You start out with a single pistol, and can pick up an smg or a shotgun. Later in a chapter you find upgraded weapons, which are a hunting rifle, an auto shotgun, and an assault rifle. The game gets pretty gory when using a shotgun or hunting rifle, as headshots will take zombie heads clean off and shotgun blasts will tear off limbs.

I have a PS3 and an XBox 360, I've owned every single Forza and all Gran Turismo's from 3 until now.  Well, where to start with this game.  I wanted so badly for this game to be a new gold standard, but alas it has fallen short.  Six years of development time meant that nothing short of perfection would be enough for a good score, and GT5 falls significantly short of simply ""good"".  Turn 10 has been very confrontational with their fan-base, and I was convinced that the only way for them to turn it around was for GT5 to be astounding.  However, after playing it for a week, I can state that this is not the case.  The game lacks the polish so often associated with Polyphony Digital.  The whole standard vs. premium car thing really sets me back and comes of as tremendously half-assed.  The graphics of some of the standard cars are laughable, PS1 era graphics, and the textures belong in Duke Nukem 3D.  The Anti-Aliasing is terrible with the shadows and smoke, leaving your car looking like a stair-case every time you venture off course or do a rally.  The shadows run at about 5 frames per second, just take a look at the shadow's movement during a replay, you'll be very saddened.  The menu system is so convoluted, I have to resort to internet boards to figure out how to a fix the correct tires for a race.  And to top it all off, the driving physics feel like they took the GT4 engine where every car felt like a Front Wheel Drive Civic, and made it have uncontrollable, snap, oversteer.  The physics do not feel like real life, and I challenge anyone who believes me wrong to take an M3 out on a road-course and see what I mean.However, it does do a number of things very well.  The photography section is amazing, although I'm a little put off by the fact that I have to unlock certain photo locals by doing impossible challenges.  I love taking photos in the game, but there are places I'm not good enough to ever unlock.  Disappointing, to say the least.The Premium cars are astonishing, although like the Standard cars, not all Premiums are alike.  Some look like slightly dressed up Standards, while others look like real life.  However, who's idea was it to have a Premium Prius and a standard M3 CSL?  There are some cars that are cool, and some that are not.  PD seems to be confused by this.Overall, it's a decent, playable game, and I hope it improves significantly with updates.  But for me, it will be a simple play until I've beaten it, then it will go back on my shelf, next to NFS: Shift and Grid.  Not a terrible amount of replay value for me.  Back to Forza 3 I'm sure.I think my friend summed it up the best when he said ""Gran Turismo is beautiful to look at, then you try driving and it's like driving a Buick through butter-cream.""",Dewstain

Therefore, my expectations were high for Forza Motorsport 2. My expectations were nowhere near met. Graphics are very underwhelming. Tracks are boring and bland and gameplay is no fun at all. The online mode is terribly boring and there's nothing to do but drive around in circles constantly (but you do get to admire other people's customised cars). The only thing that makes this game worth playing is its level of car customisation and how addicting and rewarding it is when progressing through the career mode. Apart from that, I find myself yawning whilst driving around. When you find yourself doing 8 lap races, you will get extremely bored and you'll just be frustrated when you crash right at the end because you've lost all concentration. To help, I played my own music when racing, but it's not much difference. Loading times aren't fast and the photo mode isn't as good as it was in Project Gotham Racing 3. On the plus side, there are over 300 great cars which are all fully customisable and there is relatively realistic damage (compared to Project Gotham Racing 3), the menu music is excellent and the auction house is always full of amazing cars with amazing designs.

Mostly however, I found that once again I felt like all my previous efforts had been ignored and for the 3rd time I had manic rush to collect my companions... again.... make them like me... again... and then actually get on with dealing with what was left of the main campaign. The multiplayer experience, for me has been where the game has demonstrated its real staying power.  Taking a couple of key areas from the game (and with some later DLC a few new custom ones too) you and a group of up to 3 friends are pitted against AI opponents in a king of the hill style beat down, with assorted minimissions to keep things interesting.  Even after clearing my 100% readiness for the end game of the single player campaign, I've found myself coming back to multiplayer because it is nice, casual friendly, fun.Mass Effect 3 is certainly worth a look if you have the money and time available to try it.  Players opinions are very divided on the endgame thing.... personally I like where they went with the endgame, I just didnt like how it was presented to the player..

Larian is a fantastic studio, that can make great RPG's that however often slightly miss the mark. Slightly, just below the bulls eye.Original Sin looks great, but it is just trying to hard to be ""old school"" to be more fun than a game like Divine Divinity. Movement is sluggish and slow, as is the combat. Yes, I know it's ""about tactics"" (not really), and it's not ""dumbed down"" (it is kind off...), and ""you have to be smart to win"" (not really, you just need to understand the game mechanics), but I don't really like it. The game just doesn't feel as fun as many other RPG's I've played, especially the combat is kind of disappointing. Everything else is just swell, but I can't nearly justify a 10 because for me a game hits the spot in all marks except the combat.Pro's:- Looks and feels great.- Tons of stuff to explore, steal, sell, abuse, etc.- Humour, most of it actually funny!- Emersive- Nice amount of, if somewhat boring, loot.Cons:- The game is slowwwwwww... Movement, and combat. An easy way to make a game last longer of course, but still...- Turn-based combat. But I guess that is personal.- Story isn't great.I would have given this game a 9/10, if the combat wasn't turn-based (you know, for that ""old skool"" feel the oldies always complain about).

It's sometimes very hard to see what buildings actually do and some looks very similar, this sometimes creates issue.

The usual flaws the Anno games always had are once again ignored, like the lack of a good storyline, the main campaign is more like a very long tutorial, and the side-missions in the freeplay are uninspired, dumb and mostly the same. War never was as important in Anno as it is for other games, but it's usually part of the end game, this time it's even worse then in it's predecessors.

The adrenaline boost when having to constantly dodge then slash and cut up enemies with high speed makes this game compelling and have high replayability. It is fluid and really entertaining especially when you unlock those final abilities that augment their extent of use and power when mercilessly hacking away at all those enemies. I found that the graphics and addicting music very much complement this style of game-play in the best way possible, imbuing nostalgia yet refined entertainment into the overall experience. The portrayal of Dante's personality sets him up to be the badass who indulges in killing off all those enemies with precision and skill, and in the end that's what you'll feel like doing all the time when you are playing: simply wanting to put into motion those sick moves in rapid successions to deliver wrath unlike any other. The story may be lacking in its drive or establishment of dynamic characters but eventually they are effective at inducing that urge to keep killing and getting as strong as possible, since Dante is constantly being challenged and criticized for what he does and has to do. If he becomes skilled enough, no-one will be able to control how he acts or manipulate him for a selfish goal, and you'll strongly want that for him. Hence, this overall aspect from the story compensates for other ones like character portrayal or overarching meaningful themes. The frame rate is even more consistent in this definitive edition and will more than anything contribute to the already exhilarating fighting inherent in good games of this genre but which this game specifically excels at. The weapons can be used in different ways intended to either incapacitate, weaken, or simply to slash at the enemies when needed. A pistol for example can have explosive bullets to help you weaken the enemies and give you more time for other moves. Wielding an ifrit can make it really easily to land compact hits on large enemies, especially due to their devil qualities. Which brings me to the really stellar part of the game-play. Both angel and devil abilities in the game call for incorporation in a useful and precise manner in game-play depending on the time of enemy and the the damage they can deal or the movement they allow. Since alternating between the abilities is extremely quick and easy, the wielding of the two make for a fascinating mix when employed rapidly in intense situations. The action is already enough for you to buy this game, but Devil May Cry is a special package of guaranteed entertainment and well polished game-play and setup. 10/10",lonerambivalent

My major gripe is that I don't find any of the gameplay to be that compelling. For instance one of the techniques you learn early on for fighting common enemies is leading them around with light (they love light) and making them run into traps or off edges. This is down by holding R2 or L2 and manually moving your controller to move the light.

83869,Batman: Arkham Asylum,PlayStation3,9,"There isn't much to say about the Arkham games that hasn't already been said. They redefine the standards for super hero games and games in general by staying loyal to its source material while putting the player in the shoes of the Dark Knight. They feature top-notch voice acting by Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, the definitive Batman-Joker duo. They created one of the best fighting systemThere isn't much to say about the Arkham games that hasn't already been said. They redefine the standards for super hero games and games in general by staying loyal to its source material while putting the player in the shoes of the Dark Knight. They feature top-notch voice acting by Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, the definitive Batman-Joker duo. They created one of the best fighting system in gaming, making hordes of bad guys feel more than just typical button-mashing, but an orchestra of perfectly timed counters and takedowns. With all the immense hype surrounding the game, it seems impossible that Arkham Asylum can reach the lofty goals the gaming community set for it.I'm happy to say, however, that this is not only the Batman game The Dark Knight deserves, but it's also the one he needs.The story is riveting from start to finish. The Caped Crusader has just stopped the Joker from committing a routine bank robbery, claiming it was almost as if the Clown Prince of Crime wanted to be caught. Batman takes him back to the asylum where he belongs, only to find that this was the Joker's true intentions all along. With the help of several other of Arkham's most dangerous inmates, he takes over the asylum and traps Batman and the rest of the guards inside. In order to prevent them from wrecking havoc on Gotham City through a complex plan that reveals itself the deeper you go into the story, Batman must take down the Joker and his allies before they escape the island. From the first few minutes, in which the game throws you straight into the action, to each emotionally charged boss takedown, the story and atmosphere hit bullseyes. In addition, despite a few botched lines, the dialogue and voice acting also are flawless.The best part of the game is the action, which makes nearly all of the other aspects of the game feel practically insignificant. Beating up hordes of bad guys never felt better. You create a symphony of punches, kicks, and blocks that makes you feel invincible. However, powerful Titan-fueled giants and armored thugs mix up the gameplay and provide challenge. Stealth mode also shines. In order to take out a room of armed henchmen, you need to use your wits more than your fists. Batman will die if he takes too many bullets, so each room must be prepared for carefully and the environment needs to be manipulated to your advantage to survive the night. For example, two guards might be faced back to back to cover blind spots, so blowing up a wall nearby might be necessary to split them apart and take them down individually. The AI feels incredibly real. I was detected when I was expected to be and when I felt silent and undetected nothing stopped me from delivering a neck-paralyzing punch to a thug. As I was observing the scene from the darkness above on a gargoyle, I realized that I didn't just feel like the Dark Knight. I WAS the Dark Knight. Arkham Asylum is one of the most immersive games ever created, making the player really feel like a hardened vigilante in a prison full of psychopaths. Every moment is fully engrossing and surprising; one shocking me so much I thought my PS3 had crashed and was broken forever. No other game in recent memory provides so many memorable moments that tie in so well with the DC Universe.Despite all this praise, there are downsides. Detective Mode is important to detect bad guys and pathways thought the asylum, analogous to X-ray vision. However, you can't appreciate the scenery and graphics when the game gives you no incentive to turn off this vision since there may be bad guys right around the corner. In addition, the boss battles are downright miserable. Every one feels forced and repetitive, especially the ""fight"" with Killer Croc, which is by far the worst moment in the game. Even the Joker's fight is wrong, coming as a complete embarrassment to his character. For a villain who relies so much on evil planning and deliciously complex intelligence hidden beneath an apparent madness, his boss battle is just like fighting one of the mindless Titan-infused minions throughout the game, which comes off as a major letdown.Despite all this, Arkham Asylum is a fantastic superhero game and game in general. While the boss battles disappoint and fighting feels rigid in certain areas, everything else in the game is pure, stylized perfection. There are Easter eggs and references for Batman addicts and enough engaging gameplay and storytelling to invite newcomers into the Gotham universe. But the game's crowing achievement, the one aspect that puts all others to shame, is the way it makes you feel like you are behind the cape and cowl, saving the world from the Joker one punch at a time.Welcome to the madhouse.",cbeers2513

But as the time I spent on the game increased, and my frustration mounted, I started to wonder whether it was worth it. Am I really enjoying myself by trying to create the perfect muscle memory to make it through a stage, only to be challenged by a more difficult stage that will require hundreds of deaths to pass through?It might have to do with the type of controller. I use a keyboard, and the game does tell you in the introduction screen that you should switch to using a gamepad as it is much easier and was designed for the game.But even if I did go out of my way to buy a gamepad specifically for this game (which should only detract from the score), I suspect that it wouldn't really quell my concerns in general. Platformers can be fun. But this platformer, as someone else put it, is for masochistic personalities.There are some courses where you literally require pixel perfect jumps, and with the inability to save during each course, that means you have to keep up that level of perfection throughout the course in several areas, making things tremendously difficult. Why subject myself to this? Is it really worth the hours, days of stress accumulated in trying to play like a computer? It depends on the player.

For the vast majority of us, I suspect the answer is no.The story is fairly simple; while it will keep you interested just to see whether you can save your fair maiden, the sheer difficulty of the game will likely prevent one from every reaching the end, let alone the completion of the bonus levels.In the end I awarded this game a 6 just because it does provide some short-term entertainment for a few ""worlds"" (series of courses with themes). But in retrospect, I don't think its all that worth it unless you're really good at these sorts of games. Because most people will just end up being discouraged and stressed out, and I'm pretty sure games were designed to be enjoyable.Also I bought this during a special sale on steam, when it was available for 2 dollars. So I may be biased in giving this game a higher score than it deserves, but all in all I think 6 is a decent score for this title.",radscorpion9

Hacking was one of my favorite elements of the game. You can stun an enemy machine and choose to hack it, which ques a puzzle minigame that is better than many full-fledged puzzlers in its own right. I find it difficult to explain it, so I won't. I found that sometimes it was literally impossible to do the puzzle, so I had to buy special gene tonics to help me with them.

My favourite Persona game was the duology of persona 2, which had outstanding writing and well developed characters.

My favourite Persona game was the duology of persona 2, which had outstanding writing and well developed characters. However, Persona 5 has far surpassed all of its predecessors by incorporating game mechanics and themes from each game.Something many Persona and Shin Megami Tensei fans had missed when it came to Persona 3 and Persona 4 was the demon negotiation system. Although it comes in a different form in Persona 5, the Negotiation system is back and adds a lot to the feeling of your enemies! Thanks to the negotiation system, enemies don't just feel like mindless drones. They have personalities, likes, dislikes, etc. Knowing your enemy can often save you from a world of hurt!The writing in this game is unrivalled by anything released in the last decade. Although it can be verbose and sometimes a little too in-your-face, there are lots of subtleties in the script that will be much appreciated by attentive players. Character development using the new system to replace Social Links, now called Confidants, is very good, although not perfect. My only gripe with this system of character development is that when it comes to main characters of the plot, their character development is OPTIONAL. Meaning, you can be in a romantic relationship with a party member, and nobody will EVER mention it outside of one cutscene. It's quite jarring to be in a relationship with a party member, and two cutscenes later, your friend is hitting on her.The combat system is amazing. Using the ""one-more"" variant of shin megrim tensei's press-turn system, combat feels fast paced, and even the weakest of enemies can beat you if you're caught off guard. Essentially, hitting a target's weakness (for example, fire) will cause them to be knocked down and take extra damage, and give the person who hit that weakness an extra move.Navigating the options in combat are beautiful and actually very fresh for an otherwise jrpg combat system, because instead of using the d-pad to cycle through options, each option has a different button assigned to it. For example, to summon your persona, rather than finding the option with the d pad (which grows to be tiresome in older games) you just press the Triangle button, and all of your persona's abilities will pop up, ready at your disposal.The music in this game is also top notch, as Shin Megami Tensei games and Persona games are known to be. Shoji Meguro is truly a genius of a composer, and brings a new style to each entry in the series. The theme of Persona 5's music is Acid Jazz, and it's beautiful to listen to. You spend the game listening to pretty much the same 7-8 tracks over and over, and you would expect it to become annoying. You would be wrong. The music is so good that it somehow lasts about 100 hours without getting to the point of irritation.Overall, I'd like to give this game a 9.5, but since its a 10 point system, I'm going to round it up. If you like Japanese RPGs, this game is an absolute necessity, and in my opinion, it's game of the decade, easily.",ExOicho

A lot. Iâve spent over 140 hours playing since the Japanese launch.That said, as much as I like Persona 5, I donât love it to the degree that I expected to or wanted to. The uncritical praise with which the game has been showered with, left me feeling like I should speak out.As Iâll be focusing on what I didnât like, Iâd advise readers to think of this as a companion to, and not a replacement for, the many positive reviews out there.Music/Presentation/CombatAbsolutely Excellent.Graphics:While the graphics are serviceable, and the beautiful art style helps to create a compelling world, the inability of the 3D models to convey convincing fascial expression is problematic. The 2D portrait art during dialog scenes is nice, but feels like a crutch. Such a distinctly limited range of facial expression feels dated, even on the PS3. Somehow the game actually looks worse than Atlusâs Catherine, whose expressive faces somehow manage to outshine of Persona 5âs half a decade later.Gameplay:As I have a lot to say here Iâm going to utilize a bullet point format to highlight what I feel are the biggest problems.1.	Dialog choices in social links still amount to nothing more than a simple game of choosing the correct answer to get the most points, with no lasting impact.2.	Freedom is often restricted and it gets incredibly old being told to just âgo to sleepâ so you can listen to more dialog the next day, for days in a row.3.	No hidden characters, hard to access social links, colds, random events, and quite frankly, limited replay value as a result.4.	Poorly scaled difficulty with ânormalâ being easy, while hard is absolutely punishing. Oh, and no trophy for beating the game on hard.5.	You can still date all the girls with virtually no repercussions, totally breaking the immersion. If Atlus could do it in Persona 3, thereâs no reason that they couldnât at least create a rational risk/reward dynamic for dating more than one person a decade later.Story:Itâs not that the storyâs bad (I enjoyed it a lot), but that it feels undercooked, features uneven character development, and is held back tonally by its predecessors while featuring poor pacing.The Script:The first problem is that Personaâs 5 script is incredibly verbose to the point of excess. Dialog, the majority of which is still text based, often feels repetitive, like a dog chasing its own tail. With better editing, I feel like the same story could have been told with around 1/3 less text.While hardcore fans may not care, this makes the game tedious at times, and much less accessible to newcomers.Perhaps the most unfortunate casualty of the script is that Hifumi Togo, a social link who was supposed to be a playable character, but had to be cut because the game was already âtoo long.âCharacter Development:For a game about building relationships, the social links for half of the main cast leave a lot to be desired. While Yusuke, Futaba, and, to a lesser extent Haru all have interesting arcs, Ann and Makoto are both bland, while Ryuji comes off as marginal at best.Still the game has a large number of reasonably strong and memorable supporting social links, which help to make up for this, although Iâd still say overall quality isnât up to Persona 4Tone:Persona 5 obviously struggles under the weight of the previous games. On the one hand, it wants to be dark and provocative like Persona 3, on the other, it wants to be fun and lighthearted like Persona 4. Unfortunately, by trying to have their cake and eat it too, the developers have created a game that is often (but not always) tonally flat.This is highlighted early on when a talking cat mascot joins your party (light hearted), followed by an attempted suicide (dark), to which characters react with a limited emotional range unbefitting of the situation (tonally flat).Pacing:A major reveal is made in what is literally the last 1-2 hours of the game. The story could, and IMO, should have continued for another 10+ hours, but instead just ends.Also, a certain someoneâs research is hinted to be very important throughout the game, and yet by the time the credits role, the player still knows almost nothing about it.Conclusion:If youâve made it this far, you might come away thinking I hated the game. I didnât! I love the game in spite of its flaws, but have been annoyed by coverage which has just flat out glossed over them. I feel like with just a little more spit, polish, ingenuity, and time Persona 5 couldâve been one of the best games of the generation. Instead it ends up being a serviceable sequel to Persona 4, but so much less than it couldâve been.",Malus_

274375,Call of Duty: Black Ops,PC,1,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I have left BO in 2011 in hope that someone will fix it. However Treyarch disappointed me, because NOTHING changed since that time. I was even shocked, when i someone told me that this game was patched. But without any more words lets come to pros and cons of this game.Pros:Campaign - One of the best in CoD universe, very interesting from the beginning till the end.Main protagonist - Very interesting person with unusual historySide protagonists - Also charming people, just like main hero.Graphic - Not beautiful, but not scary also. ;)ConsWeapon balance - If someone says that weapon balance exists in game, there are 3 options: paid to say so, have not seen multiplayer for longer than 5 minutes or literally stupid. AK-74u, FAMAS, AUG - no recoil, high damage, high ROF, high accuracy, huge clip size. Most of the players use at least one of these guns.Weapon realism - Sorry, but if we talk about weapons this game cant be classified as from period 1961-1975. With stuff from 90 's (AGS-30, AUG A2, FAMAS), 80 's (KS-23, PSG-1, AKS-74u) and many many more. Counted at least 20 weapons which went into prototype after 1968, when last mission occurs. Counted at least 25 weapons, which should be removed only because of it. If we are strict, this game doesnt count as something from Cold War because of AGS-30, which was introduced in 1999. Most weapon accessories like silencer or red dot sights also are also wrongly put.Price - Sorry, but paying that amount of money for full product is ridiculous.Bugs - From missing texture to permeation a part of soldier leg through wall or smoke throught wall. Sorry, but it is unacceptable in ANY game.Optimization - Anyone heard about it in this game? Because i didn't.Game should be MUCH MUCH cheaper when new (at least 30-40 %).

199412,Mario Kart 7,3DS,9,"After playing all the cups at least one, and some of the early ones a few more times with out kart configurations, quick synopsis of this latest Mario Kart is that it is tentatively brilliant.The first obvious change when start racing is the feel. It's closer to the Wii version with the sliding. There's no left-right wiggle as with the DS version; you hold the slide as long as possibleAfter playing all the cups at least one, and some of the early ones a few more times with out kart configurations, quick synopsis of this latest Mario Kart is that it is tentatively brilliant.The first obvious change when start racing is the feel. It's closer to the Wii version with the sliding. There's no left-right wiggle as with the DS version; you hold the slide as long as possible to build the boost. Most obvious is that it feels so sluggish to the DS. There you can flick the kart all over the place. Also, driving on dirt kills you! It slows you down so much and can barely steer. This is where the ""monster"" tyres come in, if you choose to select. Obviously you lose general handling and acceleration.Equally with the Wii, tracks are quite elaborate, and seem generally brilliant. Need more time to decide - to see how they cope in full race mode once familiarity sets, push karts and tracks to their limits. Already it seems they have a good learning curve to really excel, especially with the karts with lesser handling and acceleration.Also new is when you hop at the crest of a jump, you get a small boost on landing. I believe something similar in Wii where you'd waggle for a trick. Works really well in 3DS.The glider addition works well. By hopping off jumps and angling the glide, allows some strategy in gliding, whether diving for coins, or creating lift to clear sections of track.The 3D is good. I use it all the time. Of course, it's not necessary to enjoy the game.Difficulty is much the same as other MKs - ie: easy! In my first go (150cc), I played all new cups for a 1st (two attempts), 1st, 3rd & 4th. On retro cups, did first two for 1st & 1st. A friend defeated both final cups on first attempt, the retro one winning all races. He owned Wii MK so was able to adapt easily to the handling. He raced with high acceleration and handling configuration. The big advice with the difficulty is to use heavier karts and fatter tyres - ie: reduce acceleration and handling. That, along with using a fatter character, will substantially increase the challenge. I've made this my personal challenge to defeat the game on standard kart and wheels. So far, in about 7 attempts, racing on the first 3 new cups, not even close to winning any.Best of all with MK7, standard MK cheapness is there. Meaning that while often it seems unfair, it never is. Racing to hold of the hoard and even winning against the odds, it's still so satisfying. Remember also that tables will turn. One race I was leading for most of the last lap, then got hammered with blue shell and fireballs, dropping to 7th. I was furious. Then picked up a lightning and glided over in first. If there's some criticisms, it's is that the fake item is no longer part of your arsenal. While 16 new and 16 old tracks sounds nice, why not 20 new and 60 old? Even easier, why not tracks to be raced in reverse (not mirror). Sure some will need jumps or zippers to make them work. So! Add it. That immediately doubles the tracks available. Also, how about a track creator like Mod Nations Racer? My only hope is that Nintendo will add this in time. At least DLC for new tracks. This fascist way that Nintendo works has bothered me for years. As the review says here, custom options should be any combination of items, not just a single item. I'd love to set triple-reds and tails in a custom race. Why can't I?Other changes are all positive. Gone is the horrible POW weapon introduced for Wii that knocked out everyone ahead of you. Add to the fact the grid is back to 8 racers from 12, it means for a far more fluid race.  New weapons include the Tanooki Tail to whip nearby karts and block weapons, and a Fire Flower that allows shooting fireballs forwards or backwards. Both are great. The Lucky 7 (7 items all out your disposal) surprisingly doesn't over-power the game. In fact, often they are not all used for you lose them from someone else's attack.The next test is the online and just see how the game really excels and its overall balance - because the multi-player is the true measure of the game. While I rate MK DS as easily the best of the series, it was plagued with the ""snakers"" that could turbo-wiggle the entire course. The revised sliding method on MK7 means that MK7 has potential to be at least a close second if the balance no adverse exploitation is there. Right now, two friends that swore off buying a 3DS and MK7 already see the potential. One has bought the game and a 3DS with the other very much considering it.",modeVII

I played that game extensively and was a big fan. When league came out, I tried it and didn't care for it. I kept playing Dota and didn't care for any of the other clones as well (HoN, Demigod?) Then along came Dota 2. I tried that as well when it came out and didn't care for it. I went back to playing Dota. After about a year Dota 2 got better. It was just like the original but had better graphics and a control system designed for a MOBA and not an RTS. I started playing it more and more and eventually stopped playing Dota. The only game mode I was playing was ability draft. For an experienced player like myself it has the right combination of originality and skill required to play. This is where I get to how Valve has messed up with Dota 2. I am not sure if there is an over abundance of sheltered kids on Dota 2 now. I am not sure if Valve is trying to create a socialist utopia with their game. But the matchmaking system is atrocious. It is designed so that there is a 50-50 chance of each team winning. Which is just a hunch because they won't release how they match players in games. But in my thorough experience with the game that is what it feels like. In theory this is not a bad system. In theory communism works. As a player who routinely has to win games for their team and is competitive, this matchmaking system is abysmal. It basically matches up poor players with better players so they can get carried to wins. The algorithm keeps everyone around a 50% win rate regardless of how hard you try to win. In the original dota I had about a 80% win rate. This was just with random people joining a game. It also felt more natural a system. If I really wanted to win a game I could. In Dota 2 if you really want to win a game but it has matched you with crappy teammates you are screwed. After a couple of games of this happening it starts to get old. I start to get angry at my **** teammates. I can't make them better with my words but I can tell them how they suck and are wasting my time. If they have a problem with that they can mute me and report me for communication abuse. I am fine with having my chat privileges revoked even though it feels like Valve is stamping out free expression. Also If there is a mute function why do I need to have my chat privileges revoked? Anyway that has been the system and I was putting up with it. Until very recently they started putting people in the low priority pool for receiving too many reports. WTF? So if someone on the other team is beating you and you don't like it you can just report them and they will get put in the low priority pool? Why are the players given so much control on putting other players in the low priority pool? Isn't it obvious that is a **** system? And yes I know people will do that because I have reported other people before just because they beat me. Which brings me to why I wrote this review. I am currently in the low priority pool for receiving too many reports. I am not in the low priority pool because I abandoned games. I am not in the low priority pool because I was feeding. I am not in the low priority pool because I was abusing a skill. I am in the low priority pool because some **** reported me. Why should someone get put in the low priority pool for something they put in chat? This was the last straw for me personally. I have deleted the game and won't play any one of the low priority games. I have served time in low priority before for abandoning games. I didn't have a problem with that. But I feel I have to make a stand now because this is just absurd. Until Valve stops putting people in low priority for just expressing themselves I won't play their game. Heck, I might not even start playing again until they reform their atrocious matchmaking system. I am giving the game a score of 2. I would have put 0 but I did have some fun while playing ability drafts. I will change my score to an 8 if Valve reforms their matchmaking system and gets rid of communication low priority bans.",Dranz

Firefight is pretty fun though it got old relatively fast for me.  Back to the competitive multiplayer, I have a few problems with it.  For one, the maps are just horrible, there's no other way to twist it, they even managed to turn Blood Gulch into an often unbalanced map.  The spawns are atrocious on most maps, contending with Modern Warfare 2 with some of the worst I've encountered, spawning on grenades, taking two steps and getting assassinated, the list goes on.  The weapons, love some hate some.  I never knew I liked the BR from past games until I picked up the DMR, not that it's much of a problem because they brought back the original pistol, which more than often outdoes the DMR.  Sniping seems almost too easy, like the hit boxes are bigger than the should be, i really don't know.  Most other weapons won't wow you, but you probably won't hate them either, I won't going into talking about all of them.  Now, armor abilities, these can be super annoying or just... there.  It seems like people on forums have called every armor ability from sprint, to drop shield, jet pack, and armorlock noobish.  I won't delve far into my own opinion on the matter but will say this is the main deal breaker for me.  Not to mention the mere fact that people have called every ability but roll, noobish, shows that it was just a bad idea to implement them.  I wouldn't call them noobish, but each does give you a cheap way to kill or avoid death.  All the joys of splattering and sticking are gone with the chance someone could have armorlock, sprinting with the sword is viewed as a cheap tactic, dealing with cloakers is plain annoying.  It really does just cause problems, but I feel for people looking for a more casual multiplayer it could be enjoyable, but I've gone back to Halo 3 already.

If you fancy a quick police chase (FBI, SWAT, helicopters etc...) or if you want to go shopping (gun shops, jewellery shops, clothes, plastic surgery, drugs and liquor shops, record stores, nightclubs, strip clubs etc.) You can shop in these places, or you can do some daylight robbery or break in at night) You can take people hostage, knock people down, beat people up, get help with your homies by phoning them or whatever. Activities include hijacking, escort, hitman, mayhem, racing etc. etc. There are 22 activities. You can also go to car showrooms, go the arena for destruction derbies and one of the best bits - pimping up or tuning vehichles. The options available when pimping up cars is like something out of Pimp my Ride, you can turn rusty bangers into flashy nitro machines.. or add hydraulics, interiors, alloy wheels, tinted windows, body modification etc. The story missions are great fun and exciting. The story is far more exciting and it stays like that right throughout the game. There are also 'strongholds', which are buildings or areas of land taken over by rival gang members, you can earn cash and respect by reclaiming the building. After reclaiming, you can use the building as a save point. Also, rival gangs can take over neighbourhoods and it is your job to reclaim them so as you're daily income from that particular neighbourhood returns. Neighbourhood takeovers are very satisfying, exciting and great fun. You can get your homies to ride in your car to help you through the gang war. This is all backed up by amazing graphics and superb physics and sound. However, their are graphical issues such as draw-rate issues like cars dissapearing in the distance on the motorway and occasionally something appearing out of nowhere, but other than that it looks fantastic. Environments are interactive, the day/light cycles are nice and there are nice details such as water effects etc. Character customization is great too. There are lots of items of clothing, tatoos and jewellry that you can play about with and wear. The range of vehichles in-game is amazing. Sports cars, cars, buses, trucks etc. The game doesn't have licensed cars, but you can see Enzo look-a-likes and BMW's etc. Character AI is also very good, radio stations have great music and is very funny.. The actual city itself is bigger than Vice City's huge city, but nowhere near as big as San Andreas.. but it's big enough if you just want to for a nice drive around and see the sights...Weapons are great fun and there's a big range, explosions and car damage is amazing and satisfying... Car damage is good , but don't expect Burnout-like crash damage. And of course online play - reasonably addictive and good fun. It's GTA - online! Only problem is that it takes AGES to get into a game... but once you're in it's absolutely brilliant! Overall, if you enjoyed GTA you'll absolutely LOVE this. I personally think that is by far better than San Andreas, Vice City and GTA3 (I've played them all).",CiaranG.

But anyone who gives it a 10 is overlooking some flaws in the game that hold it back from being a 10.First there are only 4 dungeons in the game which would be fine if they were well set up. But all four of them are basicly the same thing. Walk around turn on the same 5 things in every dungeon then fight the boss. The layout of the dungeons is good for the most part but it feels lazy having the exact same goal on how to progress in every dungeon.  The complete lack of mobs asides from maybe 2 small robots and eyes everywhere makes the place feel empty  and removes all danger asides from the boss. The bosses are alright but are not very rememberable.The cooking system is not very good and forces you to waste a lot of time.Weapons breaking every 10 hits is not a good game mechanic. It does not change the way you fight most the time and if you find a weapon you like the looks of to bad.The shrines are cool and interesting for a while. then after about 20 most of them feel repetitive and I just stopped doing them.But besides those flaws it still a great game. You could spend lots of hours exploring to find tons of easter eggs from previous Zeldas. The about of different armors is great allowing the player their own fashion. The story if fine compared to any other Zelda game.So overall if you just want to explore Hyrule this game could be a 10/10. But for me personally Enjoy the combat and puzzles the most the game is still good but not perfect.,420dank

Enemies do not feel like they can see you through walls.Stealth is reliable, but you can also viably play 'rambo mode' if you have good aim.Probably has the best intro section to a game I've ever seen.Runs at solid 60 fps (never dips) on max settings at 1920x1080 with a GTX 970. No mouse acceleration or smoothing, so aiming with the mouse feels good.Bad:Finished the game, and the story feels weak compared to previous games. Some characters, like the main antagonist (who you'd think would be really important), have very little character development. The most interesting character in the game, Quiet, hardly gets any focus.A lot of the missions feel repetitive. Many of them are ""kill this target at this outpost"" or ""rescue these prisoners at this outpost"" with a few lines of story dialogue added in. Since it's an open world game, there's lots of filler content in between actual plot.Many things feel needlessly inconvenient. For example, your helicopter will take off right as you land on Motherbase, so you end up needing to call it back 20 seconds later when you want to leave Motherbase. Why doesn't the helicopter just stay landed until I want to leave?An option to manually save would have been nice, sometimes you forget when the last autosave happens so you are scared to exit the game and lose progress.Usage requirements are annoying and kind of ridiculous. For example, lvl 3 helicopter costs ~16 times more money to call down than the lvl1 helicopter, even though they do the same thing.No anti-cheat on FOB multiplayer and everything is client side, so there are godmode hacks and 1shot kill hacks. From what people have said, you are forced to build FOB if you are connected online after mission 22, so even if you want to play single player only, it will constantly get invaded. There is a 'disconnect' option in the game menu which puts you offline, but every time you start the game you are automatically logged in and synced with the server, so the FOB damages ends up affecting your single player game anyway. The solution to skip this part of the game is to block the game with your firewall.60 fps is great, but since it is capped at 60 fps, if you have a high refresh rate monitor you won't be able to utilize it fully. No mouse control in menus or iDroid. There's no audio options, so you can't mute the game music or make the dialog louder. And even with no controller plugged in, I still get controller prompts.",apoe

Knights of the Old Republic was the first truly revolutionary Star Wars game to do any more than catch a few minds or attract a few stares. KotOR now has a cult following even today, ten years later, and there have been cries for a better second installment and even for a third for the past seven years at least. The role-playing elements offer up plenty of choices, the only detracting factor being that your major, main playable character cannot be any species other than human, male or female. This is, however, easily remedied by the fact that you can switch between party members at any given time on the fly, and experience the strength of a wookie or the wiles of multiple jedi. Few things go wrong throughout the gameplay, save from a few minor glitches here and there, and slightly longer than average loading times in order to load the enormous world around you. The environments are rich and fairly detailed, the action and stealth mechanics are solid, the controls well oiled and tried and tested, and the story excellently crafted. This first Knights of the Old Republic game is certainly ambitious to the finest point, and for good reason as it is an epic success and in my honest opinion, BioWare's finest work until Mass Effect 2.",JohnWitten

However, everything isn't all honky dory with this package. While the core gameplay, story telling and atmosphere are all top notch, there are several issues that detract from the overall experience. The most notable being the implementation of a Support Unit system, or rather, HOW it was implemented. The Dev's wanted to convey to the player that your Kiith (clan) is weak, and it's reflected in how inferior your combat units are at the beginning of the game. I have no problem with this; What I take issue with is the ridiculous population cap that is thrusted upon you. Within the first 10 missions, your fleet will be severely limited in size (for example: 24 fighters, 1 processor, 4 workers, 1 MCV, a ramming frigate and two hive frigates). In Homeworld 1, you would have a larger fleet by mission 4, let alone mission ten. Another annoyance with the SU system is the inability to capture ships if you're near the SU limit. I can understand this too; however, when it prevents you from fulfill objections and leads to a frantic scrapping of ships, it's becomes problematic. Another issue is the obscene amount of resources you get; you can never truly use them due to the population cap. It should be noted that these issues can be solved with a Trainer. However, i must judge the game solely on what is in the game; not can be added to edit it. If i did include the Trainer, this game would have an 8. As it is, it's a good game.

The minimum deck size in ladder games is 50, itÂ´s not uncommon for decks to have 9+ legendarys, which means that building a competitive deck is super expensive. The chance to get legendarys from packs or rewards is very low, so the pressure to spend money on the game if you want to be competitive is extreme. Collecting cards in TESL is very slow and expensive. IÂ´ve never played a ccg with such a shameless pay to win business model.The prophecy feature seems like a nice idea. Every time one of your runes is broken (at 25, 20, 15 health etc.) you draw a card and if that card is a prophecy you can play it for free. That seems like itÂ´s intended to help against the ""problem"" of aggro-decks hat many ccgs have. However, while you have a chance to get a prophecy card based on how many prophecys you have in your deck (which adds a very strong rng element to the game), many aggro decks have cards that give them a guaranteed positive effect when an opponents' rune is broken. So the runes, that seem to be a counter to aggro, do the exact opposite.TESL has a lot of combos and card interactions that add nice complexity to the game. Sadly, many of those are so powerful and unbalanced that the game is simply decided by rng not by player decisions. Whoever draws his ""killer-combos"" first, wins. And those strong cards are hidden behind a pay wall.I really liked the PvE content of TESL, the story mode is very well done. The AI its much better than what other games have to offer. Sadly solo arena gets really frustrating at higher levels. The AI has strong rebuild decks with awesome interactions and also ""magically"" draws perfect, while you have to draft a deck and obviously the rng in draft can result in awful decks. IÂ´ve reached rank 1 in solo arena and managed to win against all 9 opponents at rank 1 multiple times, I'm not saying this because I'm angry for losing. I'm angry that the developers use the decent rewards in PvE as carrot, a carrot you often can't reach because the difficulty level is designed in a way that most players will not make any profits out of PvE. But hey, you can spend money on arena tickets and try again. Just another cash grab.It takes months until balance changes are made, if that ever happens (no problem, most changes make no sense anyway). Player feedback is ignored and there is almost no developer interaction with the community.TESL had the potential to be an awesome ccg in the elder scrolls universe. Shameless greed and developer incompetence when it comes to game design and balancing prevent that.",aberwitz

The first few bites are very delicious - the graphic, the hack-and-slash feeling, the sounds, all feel very nice. But, when you bite deeper you find out a squashed part - in order to master the game, you need to master its controls, and the controls are so numerous, and so poorly ported from console, that they incur a heavy strain on the average player.Then you bite even deeper - you encounter the first true boss, Tiamat- and you find a rotten part. There is nothing that prepares you for this boss, and the tactics, while very easy conceptually, are just very hard to implement properly. Moreover, if you fail to do proper tactics immediately, it becomes exponentially harder to finish this boss.Nevertheless, you decide to take one more bite, but you find worms crawling in the deep core of the game. The number of controls one needs to master to advance through the game increases by every ""level"", and the inability to see the ""health"" of a boss, or in that sense any indicator that you are doing any damage to the boss, is extremely frustrating ! This is particularly frustrating on the worm boss, where you run in circles, shooting at the boss, for a random amount of time, until the boss falls dead ? This is an insult to any mature player in my opinion.Overall, this game had a lot of potential, maybe this potential is fulfilled in the console game, but the PC version is just frustrating to play...",JohnWaine
3695,Grand Theft Auto V,PlayStation3,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I am at about 60% through the game, or game completion. No clue what that translates into storywise. I have been completing side missions and story missions pretty much evenly paced. Let me just say this, I love this game, it is one of the best, ever.But, there ARE some issues with it: First off, the graphics. They could be better, not on the PS3 or X360, then again my personal opinion is it should have been released for next gen, not current. The graphics are nice, don't get me wrong, but in this game the limitations of the hardware being used is the most apparent, ever.Second off: The map is huge, Ill give it that, but it I had been led to believe that there was more to be done. I don't know what I feel is missing, but something is missing, there are loads of side quests, I agree, but after one, two or three they all drop to a single common denominator, and it becomes just a thing to do. Entirely skippable, which I guess side missions would be, but I desired a bit more oomph.Third off: Controls; now for the most part the controls work, and work really well. But sometimes, and by sometimes it feels often since it is ALWAYS at the worst possible time it could happen, they  up. Your character will spasm or do something you did NOT tell him to do, and then your dead. Not that dying really matters, 5grand and your good to go again, you'll even keep your weapons, but lose your car.Fourth: Cars don't get properly saved, so I have wasted a good 100k bucks on fitting and refitting cars, just to have them disappear, apparently rockstar is on the bug and will have a fix for it soon.Might seem overly critical, but in essence, these are minor things, at least for me, still felt they were worth mentioning. If you, like me, find that these things are minor, then get the game now. GTA V scores heavily on story, audio (VA included), gameplay (by and large, most control mechanics work really well, except for on foot and the ****ing choppers), size and scope, and also the idea of three protagonists.

The way it eases you into the mechanics is so clean you barely notice that what you are doing is complicated as hell until you get stuck on a level. My 9 is a 10 in disguise. I needed more variety added to the challenge (Yes, even more.) So this is me just being picky, and trying to push Valve to top themselves once more on a future puzzle game (Portal or not).",Guishu

Also the brilliant voice acting fills up for any deficiencies in the graphics department (which were not a problem to begin with). The two worlds concept has been done very well since each of the worlds (a technological world and a fantasy world)  has been crafted with amazing details.I was going to give this game a title of the quintessential adventure game', were it not for 2 glaring deficiencies :1. Some obtuse puzzlesSome puzzles require completely unrelated objects to be combined and used together. And some puzzles require objects in distant locations (ie non intuitive object finding).2. The ending brings no overall closure to the overall story, Also, its kinda abruptWhen you finish an epic game of ""saving the world"" (or two worlds in this case), you want more than just basic closure for the main character. Questions like what exactly happened to the world(s) and  what happened to the other characters afterwards are unanswered here (yeah i know, they are kinda explained in the sequel, but still)So there you go, if you guys don't have a problem with the two negatives that i have mentioned, this game would definitely be a 10/10 for you.

Gladly there is an impressive variety of different plants too, all for different situations, making the defensive gameplay very fun and diverse. The game also takes place on 5 different stages, meaning that the combat tactics have to be adjusted accordingly. For example, in the levels with a pool, zombies will be coming from the water as well, and hence the player will have to take that into account and use some water plants too. Apart from the adventure mode, there are also plenty of puzzles and mini games to try out, as well as the survival mode, all of which make the game last slightly longer.

With that in mind definitely make sure you give yourself long enough when you play to get to grips with things before forming an opinion, as the pure scale of the environment and battles can be overwhelming.The best fun, especially early on, is had when playing with a friend or ideally a group, or an outfit. As you gain experience lone wolfing is very enjoyable too, but remember the game is designed with team play at the forefront. Also playing with friends definitely helps smooth out the learning curve.The free to play model is fair with anything that you can buy for money for the most part being sidegrades so you can still have a great time playing for free. That being said I think it's important to remember that someones gotta pay the bills and a subscription or occasional SC purchase if you can afford it will pay off and reward the devs for their hard work.What's more I think SOE are earning their keep in terms of patching issues with the game, adding new content and promoting a community. The game isn't perfect but its always improving and so I feel happy that I'm getting my money's worth committing the time and the subscription fee.If you're a fan of FPSs that have a great deal of strategy, depth, scale and variety then you owe it to yourself to give PS2 a try!",zoolie

Their responses are typical but that what makes it the signature Final Fantasy game. Some personality changes occurEnter, a refreshing new female heroine, reminiscent of your previous cool aloof mains from the other titles, Lightning is very much like Cloud and Squall/Leon with their cold shoulder personality and military backgrounds.Characters are varied and typical of the franchise. Their responses are typical but that what makes it the signature Final Fantasy game. Some personality changes occur a bit too quickly for comfort but this isn't a huge game breaker as you spend much more of the game utilising the new combat system.This game introduces the new battle system, although many people say pressing 'A' will play the game for you, I disagree. This mechanic requires the player to chain abilities with the use of particular damage classes such as the Ravager or the Commando - a system which hasn't been implemented in the other games. The new instantaneous switching between roles provides relief as it doesn't take as long as some changes in other games (FFX-2 Dress-spheres for instance which took one turn each time you changed).It brings clearly defined roles to your party which can be set in the options according to your likes. Various characters are more suited towards particular classes such as Lightning - Ravager/Commando, Snow - Sentinel/Commando and so forth. There are Ultimate items as there has been in some titles but they require some crafting to be created.Storyline is not the best but it is interesting, the race created by the Gods, fal'Cie, and then those who are chosen by the fal'Cie. Those who are chosen, the l'Cie' are given a task called the 'Focus'. You explore Lightnings home 'city' the Cocoon, before venturing to the rumoured hell: Gran Pulse. Although somewhat linear you do explore areas and grind as you do in the usual games although you're just on a shorter leash this time.Music is quite a pleasure to listen to, a bit more modern than the usual fare. Reason being a new composer on the block. The graphics are amazing and most actions are seamless and smooth - what I'd expect from Square Enix's quality of work.Bottom line: it is a game typical of the FF universe, some interesting implementations that seem to be a hit or miss with its audience at times. It is of personal opinion in most cases. The combat system is definitely very interesting to use, it may take some time getting used to. Game play is the usual. Storyline isn't up to the usual standard. Graphics is top notch. Interesting characters and a satisfying ending. Not for all but it is all for some.",CynicalCyberCat

DOOM is back. As a love letter to the original series, it's perfect. Combat is fast and frenetic, with a heavily emphasis on mobility and item resourcefulness. There is no regenerating health and no hiding behind cover, but you have access to a full weapon wheel as compensation. It's all complemented by excellent level design which inspires a ton of exploration on the part of the player, and there's a lot to find in exploring (new weapons, upgrade tokens, and collectibles). On top of all of that, each level is accompanied by unique challenges and even time trials, with rewards for completing each. These rewards, along with most of the game's collectible secrets, go towards customizing the way you play (ex:// speeding up gameplay or providing you with more resources), and the way you upgrade your character actually matters; there are upsides and downsides to specializing along a certain path. What you end up with is a highly replayable campaign.What really sets DOOM apart from other shooters on the market is this: it's all about the shooting. The atmosphere is stellar, but never becomes intrusive thanks to a lack of the in-your-face, dramatic bravado that plagues the majority of modern shooters. The story is good for what it is, and what it should be - it provides an interesting enough justification for the chaos (just don't expect the narrative complexity of, say, The Last of Us). Ultimately, the game's tone is incredibly consistent. It wants you to have fun and revel in the ultraviolence, and that's what the original DOOM wanted for us back in 1993. Whether you're new to the series or a veteran like myself, the game has a ton to offer.",jazzagenomad

Once the flashlights are tweaked, it will be a fairly balanced experience. Well, as balanced as a Battlefield experience can be. While some of the classes are decently equipped to take on vehicles, the fact of the matter is that the playing experience in a vehicle far exceeds being a typical soldier. Your opportunity to actually get on a roll is far easier in a tank than it is on the ground. Considering how many rockets it can take to blow up a tank, things get a little hazier on the ground. This is still the most complete package of a Battlefield product we have seen yet. I hope they continue to tweak it to make it a better playing experience (the input lag on PS3 is very annoying), but it is still a very worthy purchase despite its several flaws. Basically, this is a good game that just got too much hype for the way it turned out.",mistaeK

There's really nothing not to like except maybe the reason that the game is easy to play. Automatic weapons are overpowered and dominate.

I'm running this game maxed out at 180 FPS. The second issue I believe are the maps, some of them are random and make no sense. Too many buildings and corners which clutter and are confusing for the player memorize.  They just don't seem that well made.All in all good game. Worth the money?

I mean it is difficult, but that's not the problem, the problem is that its horrendously designed and when games are this poorly designed it really isnt a good idea for them not to have a forgiving nature. The game itself tries to mix western style high fantasy with outdated traditional Japanese design sensibilities which isnt a terrible idea, but its so poorly executed that the player constantly finds himself dying through no fault of his own. Camera's getting stuck on the surrounding, rolling directly through solid walls and falling to your death etc. Add to that the unfriendly user controls and interface with multiple button presses when one would suffice, odd control layout (left and right bumpers are the primary attacks / defence), the huge eye-saw of a HUD and inventory system, and the fact that game regularly slows down and gets very laggy even when there aren't any enemies on screen, and it all boils down to a terrible port of a mediocre PS3 game. And to top it all off, the environment GFX and sound are bland and uninspired... Anyway, I've wasted enough of my time with this game, so I'll end with the warning, regardless of what you have read about the PS3 exclusive Demon Souls (which apparently did have some potential, Dark Souls the sequel is not a worthy successor or a game I can recommend to anybody, especially on the 360.",Sh0dan

GTA IV is a okay game with wasted potential. This new game of the acclaimed GTA franchise could have been even more exciting and ""mind-blowingly"" fun than GTA San Andreas, but it fails miserably for the sake of ""realism"". Dear Rockstar, if i wanted to eat a hotdog on the f#cking street, talk on the phone with people that i don't care about; going to lan houses and forced to go to extremely boring places like theaters i would have done it. Why i didn't make any of those activities ? Because they are BORING! That's why i play videogames. I admit that GTA San Andreas was compromised with reality at a certain level, but it also gave you full character costumization; the possibility of buying houses; learn karate movements; costumize cars; fly airplanes; awesome radio stations; much more cool places to explore along with interesting characters and missions. GTA IV doesnt have any of that, instead, we have boring stuff like playing darts and surf on the internet. Actually, you won't remember almost anything of the game besides the graphics, city and multiplayer. Nearly all the characters are boring or just irritating. God, i hate Roman so much that i would be able to punch a kid right in the face if that could shut Roman's mouth permanently. I also can't stand the ""overweighted"" accent of Niko Bellic, despite of how hard i tried to like him. Most of the other characters are always asking favors in desesperate and annoying ways. In GTA San Andreas, the missions with Sweet felt natural, like if you were helping a friend. In GTA IV, people sometimes screams(literally) for help as if you owe them a favor or something like that. Maybe i'm being too nostalgic, but the thing is that GTA SA was way more fun and had much more likeable characters (except for Catalina). The great part of the missions in GTA IV follows the logic: ""get a car - go to a place - kill thousands of people - return"", with that ""little to no variety"" you can get easily bored after a couple of hours. The city is brown and ugly, sorry but it's true. The ""euphoria"" thing makes Niko move sooo slow that is almost painful to watch. ""Because that's realistic"" - Rockstar would have think. The combat system is an improvement over the old GTA games but the super slow ""pseudo-realistic"" movements ruins the flow of the battles. If all of this would not be bad enough, the frame rate is always an issue. Multiplayer is multiplayer. Let's be honest, you know what to expect: ""deathmatch"",""team deathmatch"", a ""sandbox"" multiplayer mode where little psycopath kids can have fun by creating hell on earth on NY streets and etc. Even 7 for this game feels like a generosity, but the game can be actually fun sometimes. I'm glad to see at least a 7.9 user score on metacritic, it means that not all the people here have ""half-brain"".

It IS an interactive story rather than a full-fledged action/puzzle game, but that's not the issue I have with it. I do wish it offered more of a branching story line, if story is where it's trying to shine -- most of the conversation decisions seem to be purely cosmetic.  (They're also stressful to make; there's usually barely enough time to read them all before the timer runs out.) But more importantly, the story it does lead you through is just so generic. It must have hit every single zombie apocalypse bingo square in the first half hour. That's what killed it for me. If there's no gameplay to speak of and no exploration of the game's world allowed, the story better be gripping. It wasn't; it never made me care. I'll grant that the characters were decently written for the most part, and I hope they will grow in complexity in future episodes.On top of the lackluster story, the gameplay aspects are terribly implemented. It might play better on console, but the PC controls are atrocious, character movement felt cumbersome and stunted, and the fixed camera/scenery drove me batty, since it frequently conceals walkable paths. The player is also artificially held back from progressing at multiple points. Some of the puzzles you're presented with have obvious solutions, but the game won't give you the tools to solve them until you've passed some other check point. (The brick thing was particularly annoying, as was the pharmacy door.) Some other puzzles were also just insulting to the characters themselves. I won't go into detail, but Carly -- presumably at least passing familiar with technology, being a reporter, not to mention perfectly capable of firing a handgun -- couldn't figure out the issue with the radio? Twice? Really, now?As for the the visual style, I'm not a fan, though I'll grant that's partly a matter of personal taste. The line work looked sloppy to me, the colours too muddy -- Clementine's face was a good example of this. What's not a matter of personal taste are the graphics glitches, particular the pixelated shadows all over the place.

Fortunately Kojimaâs ability to conceive ideas and set pieces that very few other game designers can, means there are always surprises just around the corner and this is largely what kept me playing all the way to the end.

The new online stuff and interface is nothing short of amazing.  The idea of being in a league all throughout online is awesome.  Maybe console noobs are used to it, but for us PC gamers this is the first time we get the full fifa NG experience and this is what  a soccer game should be like.",cmoyano

273234,Assassin's Creed Origins,PlayStation4,9,"In my opinion the best Assassins Creed so far which doesnt deserve the rant it gets.First of all I m playing AC:O on a PS4 Pro with 4K HDR equipment and the game looks amazing. Anyone saying that the graphics are bad has honestly no clue about it. The facial expressions are not perfect but still very good, the atmospherical details are stunning, like brick walls, grass, sand beenIn my opinion the best Assassins Creed so far which doesnt deserve the rant it gets.First of all I m playing AC:O on a PS4 Pro with 4K HDR equipment and the game looks amazing. Anyone saying that the graphics are bad has honestly no clue about it. The facial expressions are not perfect but still very good, the atmospherical details are stunning, like brick walls, grass, sand been blowing through caves, sun blinding light that covers you when exiting a building. I didnt mention any obvious bugs like clipping, render popping or frame drops which is amazing because a lot games suffer on this end.Voice acting is well made and covers the whole game which is to me something decently appealing. The voice seem to fit pretty good what they need to represent. Fighting, soundtrack and ambient are also really decent. I enjoy it a lot on my home cinema setup.Controls and combat got some irritating beef which made me hold back on this game but honestly I dont get why. I still feel pretty noob-ish on console controls sometimes but AC:O has a well enough mix. Easy one button mashing which needs to be switched for shield carrying enemies and some bow action, mixed with some dodging. I personally dont need more and I like the basic simplicity of it.The inventory and crafting system is well made. You need to grind a bit for the materials but it is okay. You can get it by hunting animals, robbing material transfers or jumping on ships looting them. Another way is just by exploring and looting the environment or ship wrecks in the sea (which looks amazing!!). I didnt experience a carry limit. Everything you gain can be dissembled in your inventory by one click to gain raw materials or can be sold on the market. Items have different looks, feels and rarity. I like this a lot give the open world feeling a deeper rpg part.Sneaky sneaky can still be part of the game if you want to be. Assassinating is still huge if you want it to be huge and also plain slashing your way through is also mostly possibly. It is fair that the game provides a solution for everyone.Questing and progression are decent to me. You need to invest quite some time. This could be hard for casuals but is exactly what the majority of core gamers might be looking for. The side quests feel very appealing to me. There your casual fighting, delivering, revenging etc. stuff but you also need to investigate murders, help on a farm or carry injured ppl back home. I find this is a really decent and interesting mix which I havent found in a game so far.Open world is a key aspect in this game and very well implement. Synchronized spots can be used for fast travel. You can (auto)-ride by horse or splish-splosh your way on boats. Mediocre distances can be well taken by foot. I feel that the world is HUGE but its decently made so I dont need to waste amounts of time by just wandering around to another spot if I dont want to.Assassins Creed was very disappointing to me for ages but AC:O honestly sealed the deal for me. You can invest money for cosmetics (which are well made) and the world feels fun. I dropped maybe 15-20 hr in the game and I want to keep going. The gold edition which sells at sale times around 60-70 is worth it so far.Have fun!In the longrun update:After playing through most of the bonus stuff and DLCs I reduced my opinion from 10 to 9. The DLCs are well made and offer a great addition to the game although I myself felt a lack of variety in gameplay and some AI bugs were driving me nuts. I felt that the Gold Edition was too much for me. If I would ve bought only the main game it would ve been the perfect time/price ratio. Also the story progression overall lacked a bit in the DLCs.So I would rate:- Sole main game 9 to 10- Main game plus DLCs 8 to 9I still felt the game so worthy after putting aroung 70hrs in it that I think 9 is a fair rating for the bundle.",bersi84

Meanwhile these guys are laughing all the way to the bank.MW3 is a carbon copy of MW2. FACT! The guns are mediocre at best. The lag is atrocious. The maps are a similar layout to MW2 (In fact its just like a $60 map-pack) And..worst of all....Activisions laziness is evident in everything from the fonts to the trademark chickens they have clucking around the place. I'd say they didn't have to do a tap of work on this product 'coz its all the same!!!Then there's the positive reviews...they elude me completely!!! I have no clue how a trusted reviewer could recommend you spend your hard-earned-cash on something so substandard. This leads me to the conclusion that brown envelopes must be involved.Then you have Glen Schoefield BEGGING...that's right...BEGGING (google it) players to give it a good review on metacritic...and that just annoys me so much more!!! Begging us to make them more money when it clearly is...NOT...DESERVED.On an finishing note...I honestly hope the world learns from this disgrace. And going by user reviews the world over.....it looks like the COD fanbase is already falling apart. Enjoy my $60, Activision. I hope you buy yourself something nice.",bill-jay
