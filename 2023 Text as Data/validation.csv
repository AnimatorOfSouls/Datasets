And you own a shop. What could be just a strategy game doesn't really shine through its story, but through its characters. Each of them has a sould, and a role that isn't necessarily obvious when the game starts. Of course, you've got to love cute anime stuff in general, that's a requirement to play this game. So I've been disappointed by a lot of blockbuster games, while this ""little"" game appeared to be amazing. Really expecting Recettear 2 with a bigger budget.",RectalTerror

What we need is a Tomb Raider that goes back to the series roots  that is, actual *Tomb Raiding* large expansive tombs, small and confined tombs, traps that try to kill you at every turn and require actual dexterity to evade, and jumps that require forethought, practice and flawless execution in order to progress.

25355,The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Wii,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Although this is one of my absolute favorite Zelda games I can't give it a 10. The story fits in beautifully after Majora's Mask, the graphics and music is absolutely amazing. I love the twists and turns throughout the story, the villains, and how you finally, FINALLY get to sword fight Gannondorf. Even your guide/assistant (Midna) is enjoyable because you get to know the backstory of her and her people (Personal Theory: Her people are the ones who made Majora's Mask). I enjoy the twilight realm and how you can turn into a beast....the bosses are fun and the temples are interesting BUT as much as I love this game there are still a few problems.My biggest problem with this game on the Wii.... Link is RIGHT handed. No joke, LINK.... notoriously and ALWAYS LEFT handed before, is now RIGHT handed. Continuity issue! Sure, I understand why they did it with the wii-mote controls and such (you swing the wii-mote to swing the sword and most people are right handed and it would be weird to be cross swinging on the screen) but still. I think it's kinda cool how they utilized the wii-mote in aiming your arrows, swinging the sword, etc but the issue is still present and as a major Zelda fan and it irks me to no end and is the main reason I can't give this a 10.Secondly, what the hell is up with Gannon? He looks like an old man in curlers.... they should have kept the design and improved the graphics from OoT's Gannon.Thirdly, the fight with Zant is just... bad. He's intimidating up until you fight him and after you do or in any replays of the game you can't take him seriously anymore because he fights like he's having a little temper-tantrum.Fourthly- For a Zelda game, it is a bit on the easy side (not that it really takes away from it and is a great way to introduce new players to the franchise) and sadly, being on the wii, it doesn't have HD capabilities meaning there are some jagged edges and blurriness but even so, it still looks nice and is still improved from the N64 graphics by a lotFinally- the ending makes Link seem kinda retarded with what Midna (almost) says to him. I REALLY am hoping for Midna to return in another Zelda game... a sequel to Twilight Princess story wise keeping the same (or better) graphics and music etc.I still love this game though, even on the wii it's amazing...story, music, graphics, gameplay, it's all there and fantastic and solid.",GypsyPeach

244494,SUPERHOT,PC,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        [Brief Synopsis of Full Review]Whereas many strategy or puzzle games last much longer than they should or wrap up much sooner than anticipated, I think Superhot nails just about the right amount of time to place an emphasis on standard gameplay. Before things can get too overused or stale the main content is over and it's onto the seemingly neverending variations of levels available to test yourself with. To add to replay value there are also differing ""modes"" that prevent the use of certain items or make the main objective be that you complete the level in a specific fashion, furthering adding elements of strategy and puzzle to the gameplay. Simple in concept and only relatively more complicated in execution, Superhot is super and it is hot.Concept: Take the core of gameplay from any shooter and that gameplay will revolve around shooting, plain and simple. It's in the title just like it's in gaming DNA. Now add a twist where the entire thing moves in slow motion and you're prone to insta-kill enemies just as they can do so to you. Messes with your mind a little bit at first doesn't it?Graphics: I personally loved the art style that permeates this world. Your enemies are brightly colored but not so detailed as to be fleshed out beyond mere polygonal shapes. The same can be said for the surrounding world, which lacks color but remains sharp and clear in its definite shapes and settings.Sound: The sound work is nothing special or remotely spectacular but what it does is excellent pace the game along so that you never feel like you're chugging along slowly, rather playing through in a blur of speed alongside the constantly crescendoing and galloping soundtrack.Playability: There should be no confusion here once the controls have been established, as your one and only goal is to move forward at all costs, eliminating those who dare to stand in your way and doing your best to survive their counterattacks.Entertainment: For a title that revolves around slowing combat down, I never once felt bored or tired of the matters at hand and instead felt that much more tense and anxious as I made my way slowly but surely through the levels and the world.Replay Value: Moderately High.Overall Score: 8.0",JohnWitten

Dungeons are just as boring as they were back in Warlords, story presentation is just as in-your-face as Warlords, and instead of Garrisons trying to monopolize your time you get Class Halls.Once you get past the Burning Crusade meets Wrath of the Lich King nostalgia, you'll discover, as I have, that the game is still a shadow of its former self: shallow, meaningless, bland.",vreynauld

And of course I spent like 5 mins trying to score with the basketball:)  I was afraid of a few things like the cover system which I don't like but the great thing again that you are not forced to use it.

There are a lot of emotional scenes in the game. The supporting cast (for the example the Endurance's crew) is amazingly done!

The game makes an effort to be historical in terms of starting points, but once you begin playing the game things can quickly become very ahistorical.Now the pros of the game are that it's got interesting mechanics for most things.

There's a lot of things going on, and small details are important. It can take hours of attempted gameplay to really begin to get a grasp of what's going on. You'll play a bit and start to get the hang of it and then everything will explode and you'll have to start over. Most of the time the game labels where numbers are coming from with clear tool-tips, and there's several nice wikis and youtube vids on the various concepts of the game to keep things clear.

117645,L.A. Noire,Xbox360,4,"I'll start with the game mechanics. They basically ripped the whole feel of the game including driving, walking, brawls, shooting, etcetera from the GTA engine. While this is okay, they didn't add anything new in innovative gameplay. Unless you count having your camera locked in a specific action as your character does something (searching a dead body for evidence). The cases themselvesI'll start with the game mechanics. They basically ripped the whole feel of the game including driving, walking, brawls, shooting, etcetera from the GTA engine. While this is okay, they didn't add anything new in innovative gameplay. Unless you count having your camera locked in a specific action as your character does something (searching a dead body for evidence). The cases themselves simply aren't very tough. Having played 5 hours on my 360 and 3 hours on the PS3, I can safely assume that I am out of the tutorial section of the game and that this is the difficulty the cases have. You simply gather evidence, and at first I thought this was nice, there was some dummy evidence that was useless and only meant to throw you off, but it was all scripted. It's not like they just littered the scene with things you'd find at a crime scene or a house, they made everything you can pick up there for a reason. So instead of having to cycle through hundreds of pieces of evidence or objects that I could use to extract information out of people, I basically had maybe a dozen or so items that would appear in my notebook when questioning people. I was hoping for the ability to collect thousands of useless things with only a few being of any relevance to the case and leaving me to sit down and actually THINK which piece of evidence I should use for my situation, rather it be questioning a witness or interrogating someone. The consequences are pretty limited too... I know I'm nitpicking, but this is a serious issue. What happens when you fail a case? You get thrown back to the closest check point before you messed up and failed the case. I was hoping failing a case would simply never let you replay it again in that campaign, thus making people be cautious with their actions before making sudden moves. That or they could have at least have you start over again at the beginning of the case. The witnesses and suspects are way too obvious in their emotions. It basically rolls out like this: Is he innocent? Then he'll be rational when you ask him questions. Is he not innocent? Then he'll act hostile and irrational to the slightest question you ask him. There are times when this isn't the case, but it seemed like it was too easy. Intuition points... I am nit picking now, I admit it. They're basically hint cards, and there is nothing wrong with it, but it's just that... the game is so easy. If you have any critical thinking skills, then you won't need the intuition points hardly if at all. The graphics. I know this is the icing on the cake and not anything you should grade the game on (unless it's obviously bad), but the graphics are mediocre. It looks like a game from late 2006. The cut scenes were obsessive. I simply hate cut scenes in games. They remove gameplay and any interaction you have with the scene at all. They could have at least had it scripted, because it was completely unnecessary to take ALL control away from you without letting you at least experience through your controller.  They need to stop this, period.The sounds were pretty good. There are times in the game where I noticed the sound engineering at work, and I applaud them for it. It's not the greatest in terms of sound engineering, but there is clearly talent in that sector.The environment however is lacking. It's very non responsive in general. The civilians don't look up at you when you're chasing a criminal, they don't even make any acknowledgement of you unless you near run them over.This is all I can think of for this review, so I'll draw this to an end. The game was certainly a change of heart for Rockstar (they co-developed it and published it, don't you dare tell me this wasn't heavily influenced by Rockstar) and they tried venturing out into unknown territory. I'll give them a ""bravo"" for going beyond the medium and not simply rehasing GTA over and over, like with GTA 1911, or other wise known as Red Dead Redemption. However, they did not deliver it very well. The cases are too easy, the gameplay mechanics seem very old and not very improved upon, and it just doesn't feel like it's own game. It feels more like an expansion pack or a developers mod for GTA IV. This game will receive 10/10s from many 14 year olds, I assure you, just because it's a Rockstar publication and co-development. I almost feel like giving it a 0 to counteract the perfect scores, but I will not. A 4 seems like an appropriate grade, albeit may be viewed as a bit harsh, for this game. There was so much potential with this game, but it simply failed to bring it out.",Rosenzweigjcb

However, if you're looking for a varied and involving experience you may be slightly let down like me.  Heavy Rain is a much better game in terms of 'an interactive movie experience' as after the first half of LA Noire you'll be starting to wonder if there is more to the game than driving slowly from A to B and deciding whether people are being A - Truthful, B - Withholding or C - Lying judging by their over emphasised facial expressions.  To begin with the gameplay is fascinating and the graphics will blow you away, but ultimately this is a shallow gaming experience which tries to be deeper than it is with overly long investigations and an insight into the character you play as.  Cole Phelps is not your typical Rockstar-esque protagonist; he dreams of a perfect world and plays by the rules, so much so that you'll wish he could just pistol whip some suspects for a change as they surely did back in those days.  Forced plot lines spoil what has gone before later in the game, but I won't give anything away.In terms of gun action, it's a shame that there isn't more of this in LA Noire as the cover-shoot dynamic is as good as in the GTA games.  These encounters become very similar / predictable the more the game goes on and things aren't varied by weapons as Cole generally only carries a pistol.  Car chases add another side mission task, but I found these to be pre-determined so that the car you were chasing couldn't be caught until it inevitably ran off the road itself allowing you to make the arrest.  Seriously, you can smash / shoot the crap out of the cars but it aint stopping until the game engine dictates it.  Overall, I found the game to be far too linear and stiff with the over-arching story a little weak which is surprising considering Rockstar's strength in story telling.  After the first half you'll desperately want something exciting to happen, but it just doesn't come and you'll still drive from A to B and repeat the same structure until the end.  For a piece of graphical achievement I'd recommend this, but if you're looking for an interactive adventure that you keep you on the edge of your seat take a serious look at Heavy Rain.",RPGaddict

It's like acrade nostalgia of trying against all odds to beat Shao Khan at the top with plenty of Kombatants to choose and fight against you won't be left out. The co-op is a great expirence as long as your Kombat buddy isn't greedy in his time before tagging you in. Let's go in-depth a bit. To begin here I'll review the characters. Each Kombatant as they are called is well rendered, well designed and very fun to play as. No two characters are anything like the other though they may have some similar Kombos or special moves but the similiarity there is that they use the same combination. Other than that each character is completly unique and no doubt everyone that plays it will have their favorites picked in no time or already picked as fans of the old game will certainly love this. Next off, the gameplay. The gameplay is smooth and keeps close to the original. The Kombos are the same for many of the characters to give a sense of nostalgia to the older games whilst still adding new ones and more. The Co-Op is great and the Tag-Kombos encourage calling in your buddy to beat the opponent down before they even take control. Online multiplayer can be relentless because if your not skilled enough then they won't hesitate to beat your down and lounge in your blood. That can be the only misleading part about this game but what drives away from multiplayer can be made up in the Co-Op. The controls work well and are very responsive which dosent drive away from the game in a frustrating pit of lag. Next is graphics and design. This game runs the Unreal Engine and it uses everything it has to offer. The graphics are spectatular, the level design takes old maps and reinovates them in a beautiful fully rendered engine and world, and the character damage works very well keeping scars and tears from battle in the location they were recived. The animations are all smooth and I have yet to see any errors with them or the graphics. The art design of this fits what Mortal Kombat has always had, a dark edgy time where the fate of a realm lies in your bloodied hands. The Story mode is most likely the best ever put to a MK game and the art really helps it. The design and graphics create that brutal world where the only kind words you will hear are the sounds of your enemy's defeat. All in all this game is incredible and I more than highly reocomend it. To those who have ever enjoyed an MK game, your chariot awaits.",Armegdon

The game crashed twice and forced me to reload three times because of a persisting bug with terminals and character getting stuck.The UI is really, really bad. There's no keybinding consistency and loot menu is very counter intuitive. To navigate it you must do three things at the same time. Keep your mouse coursor on an object, scroll with your wheel and use a keyboard key to move items into your inventory.I'm constantly finding myself having to alternate between navigating with WSAD and a mouse to switching to directional arrows to navigate dialogue. In menus I'm confirming with e, then suddenly e cancels all my choices cause I was supposed to press space or enter. It's really, really bad.The visuals are decent but definitely not at a level that warrants that high system requirements and performance this poor.Overall I gotta say that I'm not impressed. This isn't a finished game and shouldn't be released in this state. Shame on you Bethesda.

Persona 3 is an amazing adventure from start to finish, and the new FES version adds even more to the already stellar Persona 3.The gameplay is centered around dungeon crawling juggled with high school life. The characters are well presented and the turn based battles are fun and strategic. Although I lament the fact that I can't take direct control of party members, there are only a few instances in which this actually became a real issue.The story is the real selling point of this game, and it deals with some pretty depressing themes, such as death and depression. The game tells its story incredibly well, and near the ending, you really feel the weight of your entire journey so far on your shoulders, and it all culminated to a bittersweet but immensely satisfying ending that you will remember forever. But just in case that wasn't enough, FES has added a lengthy epilogue chapter called ""The Answer"", where you play as a different character and go on another adventure to discover a truth after the main game.The characters are very well written and believable. Even if some characters get on your nerves, it's not for lack of characterization. The characters in this game feel relatable, and a few of them you will downright love as you go through the adventure together. They become stronger with you, in battle, in their connection with you, and in themselves. It's a hell of a feat to get the player to care as much about the characters of a game as Persona 3 does, but this game manages it wonderfully.Persona 3 alone was already an amazing and unforgettable experience, and FES only makes it better with the addition of some new and altered Personas, new sidequests, costumes, and The Answer.

The tracks are quite linear with no room for major screw-ups by the player. This is one of those racing games where its more efficient to drive into the wall and change direction by force than its to slow down before the curve.

It could definitely be expanded upon but i works fine as it is and i found the overall racing gameplay to be fast-paced and fun. The game do has some problems though. There isn't a whole lot of different game-modes, customization options or track variety. The AI doesn't put up a good match in single-player and its seldom hard to finish at first place. This becomes especially clear when facing the bosses one on one. The game tries to make up for this by giving you extra goals to complete in a race aside from winning and it works quite alright even though some of the extra goals can get annoying. Another strange design decision that  i should mention is that you need to earn specific ranks in multiplayer to unlock some game modes which seems strange and really hurts the multiplayer part of the game.

I downloaded the XBLA demo and, after playing the first level, was impressed enough to buy it. There is no doubt in my mind that this game deserves the approx. $15 price tag you'll pay for it. An instant stealth action 2D classic, in my opinion, Mark of the Ninja makes you play as a ninja in a quest of revenge, with a few twists. The story and cutscenes are good enough, although they could have skipped it and it wouldn't change my opinion about the game. The level design is very well-done. There are multiple paths available, some obvious, some less. But even for the less obvious paths, navigating around the levels is still well-paced and doesn't bore you. After each level, you get to upgrade your gear using Honor points, awarded for avoiding detection, stylish kills or going through the level without killing anyone. Speaking of stylish skills, a lot of upgrades are available to allow you to kill in different fashions, from hanging down a pole to killing some poor guard through a door. Not killing anyone is also a great challenge, made easier with the use of upgradable and unlockable ninja tools, such as firecrackers and flares. Aggression tools are also available, such as traps and ravenous insects that devour enemies alive, scaring the crap out of everybody witnessing it. One thing that is very enjoyable is actually to terrorize guards by committing gratuitous violent actions and having them witness it. You can hang bodies to poles, throw dead bodies at a guard, use poison, etc. to terrorize guards. Scared guards will become trigger happy and shoot at everything that makes a sound or appears through the darkness, be it rats, or even their fellow guards. A very fun and challenging way to play levels is to terrorize guards and lead them to clear a building filled with their colleagues, using quick appearances through lights or the use of firecrackers to fuel their fear, only to have them throw themselves off a ledge when they're done. Other upgrades include different suits that give advantages such as, per example, silent running to the detriment of carrying weapons. The game is long enough and the replay value is huge considering the upgrades, multiple ways to dispatch enemies and the New Game Plus mode, which adds a restricted line of sight and overall make the lurking in the shadows experience a lot more stressful and realistic. The checkpoint system is also great: getting detected and killed will not affect your end score and will just reload you at the previous checkpoint, allowing you to try different things and aim for a perfect score without having to restart the level countless times. I have only two complaints about this game. While the controls are great, the Action button is used for too many things, such as dragging bodies, hiding in doorways, pickpocketting, etc. It is usually not a problem unless when in a room with many options. It's a little shameful considering the LB button is not used for anything, so they could have used it for some of these actions and spare us the previously mentionned troubles. The other complaint I have is that there is no way to play specific levels or even restart a game once you completed the story once. You can only have a single save per storage device and you can't start over without deleting it entirely. The very enjoyable game experience do make up for these two issues however, and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes stealth action and platformers.",netcoder

I think that alone makes it a worthwhile game to play. The past few years games have been way too focused on cutscenes. Luckily, Dishonored does not have many, so I can’t complain about the plot too much. Out of all of these stealth games this generation of games, I think the controls with this one seemed the easiest to use. Naturally, with any of these covert stealth games, the controls can be frustrating and you just want to pry yourself into your TV screen because switching between the powers is sometimes not as quick as one would desire. The powers are awesome. One thing I really liked is that you can combo them to how you would like to play. It had some great writing and a great plot. Many say that the game does kind of punish you for being what you are, an assassin, which is a valid point. However, it is definitely more difficult to keep the death count low, which is the point.  The game length was fine. It promotes exploring. I found though that near the end I was getting tired of it though and just slaughtered everyone.",LilD

168030,Gone Home,PC,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Gone homeGone Home is a videogame developed and published by a company from Portland, Oregon called The Fullbright Company. It was created by Steve Gaynor and some more people and released 15th of August 2013. Gone home is a fictional game that is packed with surprises and hidden adventures.At the beginning of the game, you get a phone call that gives you information about the character you are playing as. Her name is Katlin Greenbriar. You begin on the porch of the house the game takes place in and find some baggage that tells you that the year is 1995. The plot is about discovering the family’s secrets in the mansion in Portland, Oregon on Arbor Hill. You play Kaitlin Greenbriar in first-person who is the oldest daughter of the Greenbriar family. She has two parents, Terrance and Janice and a younger sister, Samantha. Samantha, also called Sam is 17 years old.After being in Europe for the past year Kaitlin returns back to America and arrives to an abandoned house. The objective of the game you try to find out what has happened to the family. The more you look the more clues you find making the game much more exciting.I think the game was a little bit disappointing. It did not turn out the way I thought it would and that kind of disappointed me. I think it is a really good story and the effects and mystery behind builds up the story, but I wish it would turn out in another way. One thing I really liked about the game was the diary Sam had written to Kaitlin, and especially when it got told in Sam´s voice after you had found something in the house. Other things I enjoyed include the music, the graphics and the house. It was really exciting to walk around in the enormous house. I loved to play the game and didn´t want to stopIt is a really fun game to play because you can do so much. You can walk almost anywhere you want, pick up stuff and look at it making it feel very interactive and real. Except for the end it was one more thing I didn’t like, and that was that if you looked the “wrong” place you could finish the game after around 10 minutes, so I wish there was some sort of a block so that you wouldn’t be able to end the game before it was supposed to end.I would recommend the game to someone else because all in all I think it was a fun and exciting game. I think it is suitable for both girls and boys between age 14 to 18 and I would especially recommend it to people who like mystery.",anettemogster

Feelings for seeing Bethesda pick up the license later on were mixed. Joyed to see that a long awaited third sequel was on the way, worried that it's artistic and mechanical direction would stray too far from the style and feel that made the first two games so gorgeous and in my opinion, the best Western CRPG's I've had the pleasure to experience. The teaser trailer released a year ago was a good indicator of the new developers grasp of the atmosphere (in addition, the fact that they chose the original Inkspots piece intended for FO1 was a welcome tip-of-the-hat to the fans). But the indication that the same engine used for Oblivion was planned for this game resurfaced early fears. I have very much enjoyed Morrowind from Bethesda, despite a general dislike of the arche-typical fantasy-sword-and-sorcery genre of RPG's. Oblivion on the other hand, while possessing an engine that provided a vast, rich and colorful world setting and a character creation system that allowed intensely detailed tweaking when it came to physical looks, still overall disappointed me with a combat system that felt too clunky, voice acting that lacked enthusiasm, level-scaled enemies, and an NPC AI that acted far too awkwardly for me to suspend disbelief. Overall it only felt like a step-up from Morrowind and graphics and physics, with most other aspects feeling like a downgrade. Having played Fallout 3 for several days now, I would posit that the early fears were not entirely misplaced, but thankfully a little bit exaggerated as one would expect from an oversensitive fan base that was hyped up and let down one too many times over the past few years ;) The landscape, colors and settings definetely reflect the feel of the previous games; Desolate, hopeless with death and decay everywhere, no signs of life or motion other than the occasional dust winds. The soundtrack is very fitting to this atmosphere, with pieces that are either soft and slow that induce a sense of solitude, or louder scores that emphasize the vastness of the wasteland, and thus just how hopeless the prognosis of this new world is. As it was with Oblivion, detail is not spared from observation. Whether the player is traversing the wasteland or walking about in the few makeshift towns of surviving communities, they will notice the gritty look of decaying or rotting structures, the various amount of junk material sprawled around and about, perforated or covered with dirt and rust where applicable. The visual and aural setting, certainly does not disappoint. The behaviour of the NPC AI however, is still on the awkward side as it was in Oblivion, though perhaps not as painful to watch. For example, NPC's converse with each other as it was in Oblivion. And while it still looks stiff and artificial, their conversations seem to be more coherent, much unlike the almost completely random lines spouted by their Oblivion counterparts. The voice acting, while not convincing enough to be heralded as an industry example, has definetely improved enough to be considered satisfactory. Different characters sound more apart, and emotion in their tones is easier to pick up. Some textures and models in the game feel a little dated, possibly implying that the game engine has not improved since Oblivion. The first gun you procure in the game (the classic 10mm) looked and felt disturbingly clunky in my hands, although this is partly due to the fact that the pre-rendered drawings and illustrations on the previous games had given the same gun a nicer, smoother look. Fortunately such issues are not numerous, and can be ignored in time, for the most part. Combat has left me with mixed impressions. The game certainly does not play like a typical shooter for obvious reasons; The condition of the weapon as well as your skill in utilizing it directly affects your performance. Still, after previous FPS-RPG's such as System Shock 2 or Deus Ex, the glaring hopelessness of trying to shoot or snipe an enemy from afar, or even middle-range is slightly irritating, more so when said enemy doesn't seem to be having much trouble perforating you with burst fire from the same distance. Still, this is somewhat an early observation. I'm currently Level 5 with a Small Weapons skill of 55 to 60, and all my weapons are at about 55% condition at best. So the challenge, while irritating, is perhaps understandable. The transition from turn-based combat to real-time is disorienting for Fallout veterans like I, who are used to taking their time to plan their moves and spend AP's as efficiently as possible. The paused combat option of VATS compensates for this, but only up to a point. It allows time to think about your next series of moves, and of course, allows for called shots directly influenced by the usual RPG mechanics of the game. The slow-motion cinematic play out of your commands is definetely satisfying to watch, more so when you score a critical hit. However, perhaps due to the shifting camera angles during this cinematic phase, the player is disoriented for a split-second when it ends and combat continues onward. Even if only for a split second, its still typically enough for a speedy AI enemy to fire off a few more shots at you as you regain your senses and move on. For the most part, my combat style has consisted of taking some calculated shots with VATS, then taking cover while my AP's regenerate for the next attempt. The pace feels too slow for an FPS, and perhaps a bit fast for an RPG. Nevertheless, the cinematic phase entertains me enough to overall enjoy combat. Plot wise, I have not made much progress with the main quest, seeking out side quests where I can to extend gameplay. However it looks interesting so far, and I will eventually move onwards. The missions offered from various NPC's so far have not felt boring or tedious. Some are tied to the main quest, others are enjoyable distractions. The amount of solution choices and the feel of the quests are in line with the Fallout spirit. I am once again the diplomat I used to be in the West Coast of post-apocalypse USA, looking for peaceful solutions, but sometimes just going with the flow of my rifle barrel :p Overall, I am enjoying Fallout 3 with great gusto. Yes, I would have very much loved to see the Van Buren project of Black Isle succeed. Having tried out its released alpha form a year or so ago, I have little doubt that the original Fallout 3 that was supposed to happen several years earlier would have been fantastic, probably much better than what we have in our hands today. But sadly that project is buried in history now. I don't subscribe to the belief that ""Any X is better than no X."" In my opinion, the Fallout 3 delivered by Bethesda is not a cheapened form of Fallout, nor a fundamentally different form of Fallout. It is a Fallout that fully delivers the retro-futuristic, dark-humored setting its fans have come adore. The changes in gameplay, while understandably troubling for some veterans, are not major enough to dismiss this game as a failed Fallout by any means. Still, I would urge Bethesda to either drop this Oblivion engine, or fix those stiff movements for the next installment ;) .....there will be a fourth installment, right?",Trineon

It was the expansion that began to chip away the magic and wonder of a game that I had previously loved. I didn't hate WOTLK - there were many things I really liked about it. However, many of the added races such as the Vrykul, Tuskarr, Taunka and Gorloc and Wolvar ranged from superfluous (like the Taunka) to out of place (the Vrykul) to ridiculous (the Tuskarr, the Gorloc and the Wolvar). The ridiculous races gave the game a puerile quality that eroded the dark tone that WOTLK was trying to set by introducing slapstick, childish humour with these new races. This created a sense of dissonance with the feelings of impending doom caused by the return of the Lich King and the accompanying scourge threat to the world. There were also zones in Northrend that seemed redundant (ie: Borean Tundra is the same zone level as Howling Fjord) and there was too much overlap in terms of zone levels, so players didn't get to experience Northrend in its entirety because they often had to choose between zones, whereas Burning Crusade had a more balanced approach in this way. Other zones such as Crystalsong Forest seemed to have little to no function or relevance at all except for housing the city of Dalaran. I also want to say that I wasn't fond of how they handled the Death Knight class, which are GOOD, but they're not great and are still seen as a bit of a joke among the core classes because they're somewhat redundant - they're not the best tank (unless the player is really skilled - and many I've played with too many who aren't), their DPS is sketchy (again, it depends on if they player really knows this class inside out, as DKs seem to be less forgiving of mediocrity than other classes) and they really haven't found a useful place among the base classes. I think they would have been more functional as a hybrid class (tank/DPS/heals), and they could have done something interesting with them as a healer, using weird demonic spells to heal (because lore-wise, I think makes sense that healers would have been converted to DKs). Among things I liked: Achievements, the expanded lore of the DKs and the fall of Arthas, the coupe attempt against the Undercity, the beautifully crafted city of Dalaran and easter eggs like Higher Learning that encouraged players to explore and rewarded them with pets, mounts or titles. I really loved that Blizzard brought back titles, something they seemed to briefly touch upon and abandoned without explanation in Vanilla WoW, as well as the addition of the Inscription profession, which felt far less painful than Jewelcrafting, a profession introduced in BC that I still hate with a passion for reasons I can't explain. I loved the addition of Wintergrasp and the use of siege vehicles. The introduction of BoA gear was an idea I was somewhat warm to at first, but as the game has progressed, BoAs have proven to be a scourge in low-level PvP BGs/zones. BoAs give players without it an unfair disadvantage and I feel it's broken the lower-level PvP aspect of the game as they've added BoAs in subsequent expansions. Though I don't hate WOTLK, I didn't like the precedent it set for later expansions with ridiculous races, a redundant new class, overlapping zone levels that prevented the player from fully experiencing the new content and the introduction of BoAs that later resulted in a broken low-level PvP experience for new players (or players who didn't feel like grinding). WOTLK did a LOT of things right and they did them well. Though the mistakes they made in this expansion didn't break the game for me, it started to show cracks that subsequent expansions shattered, irrevocably changing a fantastic game into a mediocre experience that I no longer enjoy.",Marmalade

I couldn't make it 2 hours through my second playthrough to get a different ending.  Noting the achievements for not killing anyone or getting noticed, your player mechanics immediately go to waste.  The swordplay is so intense and fun to use, but you feel chastised for using it due to certain story endings and passed-up achievements.  I have the feeling they spent a bit too much on PR, and not enough on focus groups.  It's worth a playthrough or two, but I wish I hadn't spent my hard-earned $60 on this one.

I wasn't sure what to think of the new God of War when it was first announced, especially since Kratos became a little hard to root for by the end of God of War III. But thankfully, he is MUCH better than in the last game we saw him. He is a cold, stern and distant father at the start of the game. But he, and his son Atreus, gradually grow closer over the course of the game and I fell in love with the character all over again.And honestly, the rest of the characters you encounter on your journey are lovable as well (or give a good reason to despise them). I also feared that Atreus would be an annoying child character that doesn't really do anything. But he's kind, curious and eager to learn. And also knows how to use a bow.My only REAL hangup about the game would be that the setting doesn't seem entirely accurate. I'm no expert on Norse mythology here, but most of the Gods seem to be painted to be excessively cruel and Odin seems like an even bigger dick than Zeus. Granted, we seem to hear things from the perspective of Giants and other enemies of the Gods through shrines and other lore. Plus, only time (and possible sequels) will tell if they are being corrupted by something like Pandora's Box from the original trilogy.In any case, like you can see from the score this wasn't a deal breaker. It's not as if other media never gives their own spin to mythology. Even if you weren't a fan of the original games, I'll recommend this one. It's a fresh start in a new mythological setting. Combat is over the shoulder instead of all zoomed out. So I'd say, give it a shot! I can only hope that Santa Monica Studio can keep this up!",Risax

The star bits are everywhere. They are easy to collect. All you have to do is aim with the remote and you have some star bits. They can be fired at some enimies to stun them so you can hit them. The only thing I don't like about Super Mario Galaxy is that you can't really focus the camera. You don't have to because the camera follows nicely, but in some spots, you wish you could control the camera. My other complaint is how you swim underwater.

I loved this game up until the last moments everything little choice I had made for good or ill was coming full circle. Okay most Still not sure how the Illusive man got past the Omega 4 Relay or recovered any thing but having made friends with everyone in 2 means they're still around and helpful, The only other thing that didn't carry over right is that Udina is now on the council, (I put Anderson there) But Rex is leading the Krogan and that's helpful and Mordin is fighting the Genophage because I talked him into it. And if you load in a ME2 character you keep all of your hard earned levels allowing yo to kick ass right out of the gate. The only problem is like most people have said the ending choices all three of them generally suck reactor fumes. You die in all of them only 2 of them really solve the problem (depending on what you think the right solution is) and if you save the Geth one of them will commit genocide in on the wrong species. it's good game other than that though.",Gothic_Sora

Final Fantasy might as well be dead now since both this and FFXII and ffX-2 were massive letdowns to the final fantasy name. I'll probably pick up FFXIV simply because it's behind the guys who made my favourite mmorpg and versus XIII because it could be seen as a mature substitute for KH3 at the time. As for the main development team I couldn't care less really. They are more than likely going to make FFXIII-2 anyway since they said they wanted the XIII franchise to last 10 years.",GabB

Before I review the game, let me tell you how silly a lot of you look right now.First off, you PC gamers are complaining about the PC version under the PS4 version. Maybe play it on PS4 and see how that turns out. Because one your problems are fixed, you're gonna love it, I bet you.Second, you guys who are saying this game sucks for nonchalant reasons: have you actually played the game? Play through it before writing a review, please. And I mean all the way through the campaign.Third and final, a lot of people are complaining and whining about the Batmobile and the fact that this game out too early. I find this funny because these are the same people who whined and complained about the Batmobile not being in the other games and the fact that Arkham Knight was pushed back not once, not twice, but FOUR times. Rocksteady read has done everything they can to make this work and you guys just come here and complain about it? If I was Rocksteady, I would honestly just stop making games all together for you people.Now, this is a message to everyone. If you're thinking about not buying the game because of some lousy reviews, please get the game. Seriously, don't let someone else's opinion decide whether you are going to buy a game or not. If you WANT to play it, then get it! It doesn't matter what others are saying, because who cares! When it comes to gaming, the only thing that matters is YOUR opinion!Anywho, sorry for all the ranting, but people just need to be told. This game is great, it is everything I was hoping for in the Batman finale, and it has blown me away on every scale. I am terrible sorry for those who did not enjoy it, but maybe those are the same people who enjoy CoD. Who knows? But wow, Arkham Knight took my breath away. It is predictable, yes, but does that ruin the game!? Heck no! It actually helps if you try not to think about it. Just play the game and enjoy it! But yes, the gameplay is flawless, graphics are stunning, story is on point, and the sound is great. Even the characters are wonderful. Come on: it's the same batman game we've been with since Arkham Asylum. Only this time, it's a lot bigger than Asylum and a lot more addicting then City. This game is beyond amazing. It never disappoints me tbh. And to all the Batmobile haters: I love driving it around. I don't care if it's forced on me, I'm going to drive it for fun because it's just THAT cool. I love it.

This castle sim is not just the average simulator: it's a complex and prefect mix of all the possible aspects a medieval game needs: immersion, realism, sarcasm, playability, longevity. Seriously: I'm a medieval times addict andOk guys, please bow to one of the greatest games on Earth. I'm not much into the reviewing thing, but this game made me go: ""Ok, I have to, I must, endorse it."" This castle sim is not just the average simulator: it's a complex and prefect mix of all the possible aspects a medieval game needs: immersion, realism, sarcasm, playability, longevity. Seriously: I'm a medieval times addict and love pc gaming, I've tried a lot of medieval pc games and this one, even if its graphics are not that flabbergasting 3D thing, is among the best I found. Why?1) Immersion.If I had to be sincere, in, say, 20 years of PC gaming, this is, to me, the most successful game as to immersion. From music and sounds (often sadly neglected in other games), preciously crafted by Robert Euvino (a great modern composer, who used a mix of ancient medieval instruments and everyday working tools to recreate ingame effects and one of the most evocative soundtracks ever) to the GUI (skillfully crafted to reflect the medieval society and its rules), to the characterization of the peasants (reflecting all of the spectrum of medieval common sense and its contradictions, with a slight accent on sarcasm) and the choice of colors (the color palette they used captures pretty much the flavour of those times).Believe me, you won't find any other game much immersive than this.2) Realism.Here we have no inventions nor have we the feeling they chased the spectacle at all costs. They sticked to reality, and here you go: a game where you have men with low morale and a spiky staff, armed just with their courage; ye have plenty of archers who will die through the flames, while the few armored troops you can afford (either for you're poor and for the lack of iron) slowly advance, under the weight of their cuirasses. No movie-like units with weird anachronistic equipment (like the elephant with a mounted bombard in pseudo-historical Medieval II total war), no ultra-heroic stats or shiny glitsy gears coming from a fantasy world. You have the fatigue, you have wood and rock and a little of iron if God wills. You have hope and courage 'cause hey! this is not Hollywood - this is medieval times. For real. Here you will hear you attendant advising you that the near villages report an enemy approaching. Here you will hear the babies cry and their mothers taking them away, frightened by the incoming army, disappearing in their poor huts as the enemy approaches. You will see the hunters fight back the enemy even if they're not soldiers, you will see their hounds attack as well, you will experience the advantage of an elevated shooting position and that of the cover you get thanks to the apple trees. I could go on and on for ages.This was a game made by people who really know what Middle Ages had been. (It's not a surprise it was made in Europe, where the Roman Empire and its fall took place.)3) Sarcasm and irony.In Stronghold 1 you will experience a crude world, as it necessarily was in medieval times, constantly sugarcoated by latent irony, by wisely chosen punchlines on sentences and exclamations. Everything has been thought to ease and balance the crudeness of the Middle Ages, and sums up to a great feeling. You can feel it's a game, but still you feel it's not.4) Playability, longevity.You can have single player skirmishes with decent AI. You can have multiplayer matches. You can have eye-candy building matches, where all you fear are fires, famines and pestilences. You can build nearly whatever you want: the walls of your castle are totally in the hands of your creativity. Every brick can change the shape, every shape can impede your enemies in their path to your keep. You can even decide to put battlements or not. Forget about 3D graphics: this kind of games never truly needed 'em. Here you have the forest growing (and possibly invading you settlement), you have the fauna reproducing: you'll see the effects of blindly pressing on resource collection against trying to coexist with Mother Nature: will you try to dominate her (and condemn yourself to sour economic problems) or will you be annihilated by her slow but relentless power?5) Yeah but what about WAR?Ah, the neighbors. This game has been the first one to implement a full and realistic siege equipment. I mean: you have siege ladders, siege towers, catapults, trebuchets, ballistas, great siege shields and so on. The enemy dag a moat around his castle? You can always send your low-armoured troops to fill it up while being shot by the enemy archers. Your engineers fail to aim properly to the walls? You can send your sappers to mine a gallery to make the walls crumble. (Look out, though, as the galleries may collapse as well - and there's no insurance on workers...) Trying to ram down the gates? Good idea, but beware of the boiling oil they're pouring from above! And... what about traps?Guys, if you're truly into the Medieval thing, give it a try. It's a must-have. It's definitely worth while.",BadReloader

I acknowledge the substance of the lore behind the series and I admire the philosophy of the CD Projekt Red team, which is why, after hesitating for so long, I decided that I'd give the Witcher 3 a whirl.After five hours, I've abandoned the Witcher 3 and just won't bring myself to trust CD Projekt Red again.The combat, again, essentially requires dodging between groups of enemies or around single large ones and using the same repeated sword swings.  The animations are different but the action is the same.  While there are options to use some abilities, the fundamentals of the combat remain identical and very inane.  There are no tactical elements to combat like you would have in a turn based RPG like Baldur's Gate, or RTS games like Starcraft, or stealth-action games like Deus-Ex or Dishonored, or even FPS/Third person fantasy games like the Elder Scrolls.  The combat is repeatedly to run into a fight and dodge around with perfect timing and not get hit, which is the gameplay mechanic of a cheap, pump-and-dump console game... and such a waste of the Witcher's content.The flaws of combat essentially ruined the game for me.  While the story is interesting, I can (and just have) read it on Wikipedia in 5 minutes to skip the drama (though I'm sure much time was put into the voice acting and animations).  Without the drive to improve the character, who (like all RPGs) expresses himself primarily through combat, the side content has no meaning and the main story-line becomes only that - a story-line.I love that they tried to make something so epic in scale of integrated content and take the RPG to somewhere where it hasn't been before but this is still a game and the action in the Witcher is flawed at the core and has remained so through the series.  My experience with the Witcher is so frustrating and annoying precisely because I want so badly to enjoy the game but can't get past its most basic flaw - the gameplay is terrible.  The pursuit of a massive library of beautiful content is not an excuse for making a bad game.Also, as a post-script, the merchant system doesn't make any sense.  You can sell a sword and not buy a piece of bread that heals 20% of your health... perhaps this is supposed to be how things are but I find myself totally ignoring merchants entirely.  Furthermore, the crafting system has an incredibly steep learning curve, without any hint as to what makes sense to do or not, which is exacerbated by the nonsensical merchant system.And as a post-post-script, I really hate that I will not be able to convince myself to spend money on Cyberpunk 2077.",eriktheviking11

Civilization: Gods & Kings improves a lot with the original. The economy is vastly improved and better balanced (mainly due to the addition of ""belief benefits""), with the religion aspect adding a great deal of detail to what was previously a little too basic.Added to this, new units are inserted, AND they are inserted with some measure so that they improve the balance of warfare rather than overwhelming it. The addition of an Admiral was also a nice tack-on.The spy system is the one thing I am disappointed with in this game. It feels clunky and isolated from the rest of the game--perhaps because it is. Admittedly, it does add just a little bit more complexity alongside the rest of the expansion, and this all goes towards improving Civ V significantly.",Teflonicus

Those matches are rare though and they have nearly become extinct with Valve's changes to matchmaking. The reason I gave this game a 7/10 instead of a 10/10 isn't because of the gameplay itself, it's because of Valve's current direction they are taking the game. The mute system and recent matchmaking issues have negatively impacted my dota experience to the where I no longer play the game.

I have not touched the single player campaign yet, so my review is solely based on the bread and butter of this game, its Multiplayer.First and foremost, please disregard anyone who calls this a ""battlefront re-skin"". From Battlefield 2 all the way through Battlefield 4 I've put AT LEAST 200 hours into every iteration of Battlefield games (except 2142), and the only similarities this game shares with the shallow Battlefront game is the Frostbite engine, and maybe the Battle pickups that can be found around the map.In terms of the overall online experience, I personally find it very satisfying and rewarding. The Scout (sniper) class is reminiscent of the recon in Bad Company 2 in terms of power and gadgets. Assault class provides ample destructive power that can really pester ground vehicles assuming you just dont run out after tanks out in the open, and coupled with SMG's they can also be great with CQC. The Medic class with DMR's and med packs are great for mid range battles, and the syringe revive takes away the need to ""charge the paddles"" like in Battlefield 4, which i found slightly annoying. Support class retains the same LMG and ammo pack/crate system everyone is already used to as well.Tanks are extremely powerful and are feared throughout the battlefield, especially in the right hands. Mobility is sluggish, but the firepower is devastating. Horses are awkward though, and may take some getting used to, especially with how the play style changes with them when compared to an actual vehicle. Planes and airships are relatively easy to handle, but also slow in regards to mobility which is important when it comes to balance. The days of jet/helo whoring is basically gone for the time being, but it doesnt hinder the experience of being in the air.Most importantly, the game focuses on Teamwork. Everything you do to support your squad and team gives you points. Even accepting a revive grants you points. You can shoot up the leaderboard by just being supportive, which is great. Although at the time being everyone ISNT a team player, i contribute this to the playerbase getting used to the game right now and trying to feel things out. This literally happens to every online shooter, so give it a few weeks before you see more people working as a more cohesive unit.Overall its a fun game. Theres a few minor bugs, but nothing game breaking, at least in my experience.",Eyedrink

So just in case you hadn't guessed it already; Inquisition is miles better than Dragon Age 2. Miles better.The graphics and landscapes here are beautiful, the maps are enormous, the world is engaging. It's the type of RPG you just don't want to put down. Gameplay feels fluid though perhaps a tad too simplistic - I much preferred the more varied amount of spells and abilities in DA: Origins. The story and writing is of the same quality you'd expect from Bioware - decent enough to keep you interested but never amazing.I was however disappointed with the cast of companion characters in Inquisition. They just felt...bland and uninspired. Certainly a stark contrast to the quality of characterization in the first of the series where I felt a level of attachment to my group and was motivated to max out their loyalty and any companion quests.Despite having a number of (small) flaws I found Dragon Age: Inquisition to be an extremely compelling RPG and a positive addition to the series that suitably offsets the disappointment of Dragon Age 2. The biggest appeal and achievement here is the world they have created - the maps are VAST and full of beauty and detail. You WANT to explore and you are rewarded for doing so. Very few titles have such appeal. This is a must-buy for anyone who enjoys the RPG genre.",L_Coops

But you'll miss out on the side conversations that flesh out the game world.

You won't run entirely out of ammo (or filters) if you take the time to explore, picking the pockets of dead soldiers or uncovering the keys needed to unlock hidden safes full of cash and supplies.  At one point I had almost 500 units of currency and when I reached the next safe zone (station) I went on a mad shopping spree.The guns are well-designed and inventive.  They have a wonderful ""junky"" appearance that supports the theory that they've been constructed by people forced to scavenge through the rubble of a dead city.  But they're lethal, and have an appreciable kick (although I turned the vibration to ""high"" before I was happy with the recoil).  Slap an IR scope and silencer to the Bastard SMG and you may never feel the need to upgrade to anything else.The stealth mechanics are well done, and the AI is better than most recent FPS titles.The only thing that frustrated me was the lack of documentation regarding the controls.  For Xbox players, to access your throwing knives and grenaders, etc, hold down the Y button to access that navigation screen and hit the right bumper to actually USE what you've selected.  Hit the Left bumper to wipe the gore and condensation from your mask.  I had to poke around before I uncovered those bits.Regardless, here's the thing -- the people behind Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light introduced something DIFFERENT when these games first came out (imagine that, not another CoD or BF clone).  They  offered something fresh -- and desperately needed in a genre that's frankly been done to death.  This redux edition is a reminder (a polished reminder) of how well they succeeded.

Not to mention the journey to these areas is slowed considerably by random respawning jeeps full of baddies blocking your path.

InBattlefield 3 was supposed to be thegame of the century. It was supposed to bringwith it the best graphics and the best story ofany first person shooter in recent history, but itdidn't. Electronic Art's Digital Illusions CE (EA-DICE) has long led the sector in realism, drawing you into the war, evoking emotions previously reserved for games scripted almost as much as movies. In Battlefield 3's campaign mode, however, the gameplay is slow, predictable and doesn't make you feel as though you are making a difference. The multiplayer game is sculpted so carefully that it would be concievable to forget that it was pre-made at all.The multiplayer game is incredibly chaotic, often trancending the constraints of a traditional video game, with small actions radically changing the simulated world and rendering some strategies and equipment useless, while simultaneously granting opportunities people using others. Many items in the maps are destructible, so a well placed RPG can destroy almost any sniper nest, an accutate pistol shot can destroy a helicopter, and a exellently piloted helicopter can take on a small army. Boats, Planes, Anti-Aircraft Guns, Helicopters, Tanks, JAVELIN missiles, and hundreds of guns are ready for use, a well put together social interface (BattleLog) allow for infinite combinations, and the scoring system favors teamwork over kamikaze raids.Battlefield 3 brings with it many annoyances, and thousands of quirks. The beautiful graphics and chaotic multiplayer almost outweigh the lack of a decent campaign mode, but alas this game fits into the category filled with thousands of games made for quick and easy fun, lacking challenge, and full of cliched elements. Battlefield 3 was expected to be the next iteration of the interesting and innovative game-play of the previous Battlefield games, not the repetitive and annoying habits of cheap action books, movies and games. The wow factor of the graphics can almost overcome the problems, but DICE has grown weary of the fight, and has decided that one botched campaign cannot possibly cause them to lose their grip on the gaming battlefield.",Remlap

Cons: The combat for me left something to be desired; even on easy difficulty death becomes tedious, and there are enemies everyone, so much so that it feels untrue to the story and just annoying. Also the stealth part of the games had the potential to be great, but they probably didn't design the game with stealth in mind. 8/10 would play again.",taztaztaz10

While I agree this should never have become the norm, giving a game a 0-2 because of bugs that were resolved within days is going to do nothing but lead potential future buyers away from purchasing a fantastic game that they would love. ********************************************************************************************************* That's exactly what this is: A fantastic game. People that were initially expecting the game to be like Dead Island or Left 4 Dead may be disappointed at first, but if they can look past their expectations, they will find a true gem. The closest actual comparison to this game is a zombie-themed Fallout 3 on a tropical island. Personally, I think this is by far the best zombie game on the market. Individual zombies are relatively weak and easy to pick off, but large groups of zombies become serious threats REALLY quickly, and larger ""thug"" enemies require some strategy to kill, rather than simply more bullets. At the same time, if you are reckless and swinging your weapon all over the place, you will run out of stamina, and even small groups will be challenging. I honestly think the combat is amazing, and is just about perfect, except for the fact that the characters' ""kick"" command (default button is E, I think) is a little overpowered, and it's easy to keep medium groups of zombies stunned on the ground by spamming it. If they nerfed it, though, the game might become too difficult. ************************************************************************************************************** Starting out in this game, be prepared to have crappy weapons that you need to repair all the time. It evens out later on, though, especially as you unlock other attacks. Case in point, I used to have 3 weapons that I needed to repair in every town visit, but by about level 16ish, I had 1 main weapon that only got down to about 50% durability, with less frequent town visits. This is a beautifully done, rock-solid (no crashes or glitches at all on my system), visceral zombie basher. It's DEFINITELY better with friends, but I even enjoy the single player campaign. If there were no release day issues, I firmly believe this game would have over an 8 user score.",DrBrogbo

Customization options are really good and the characters don't look like potatoes. The game world is really beautiful, varied, with some degree of verticality due to the mountains and filled with little stories here and there in the form of notes and journals. However, the game feels largely unfinished and empty. The guild questlines are incredibly short and still allow for a character with no skill to become guild leader, especially the College of Winterhold and the Companions, though the Dark Brotherhood one is well done. The Civil War could have been much more, but it limits itself to changing the guard outfits, the dragons all have the same behavior: land at  ~35% health and the player can head-on charge, spamming attacks left and right. The combat feels largely like Oblivion: hit the enemy sponges until they die. Blocking has no benefits, you still get damage and stamina is useless outside of sprinting: enchant your weapon with stamina drain and get power attacks all day long. Despite being very nicely handcrafted, the towns are incredibly small, even Solitude, which is supposed to be capital of Skyrim, only feels different in size due to its tall buildings you (most of the time) won't be able to enter. Almost all dungeons are corridors with the back entrance either being inaccessible due a combo of high terrain and invisible walls or are just stupid 'key required' locks. The loot is very poor, even a master locked chest has no more than one or two mildly priced items, forcing the player to use a lockpick perk to suddenly find daedric items everywhere, much like the speech perk tree is required for you to sell all the items you want. Lastly, this is the first game since Daggerfall where the player character can utter complete sentences all the time, unlike Morrowind and Oblivion, but the dialogue is very simplistic: Speech checks are rare and useless: a step back from Bethesda's own Fallout 3, where you could completely bypass a quest with a simple check. They also force the character to be a dumb warrior/wizard/thief/whatever simply due to the lack of skill checks like in New Vegas: Your character, the Dragonborn, blessed by Akatosh with a soul of a dragon, is nothing more than a dumb chap who needs everyone to tell him what happened for the last years because apparently he/she was living under a cave or something.Bottom line: the game is enjoyable, but not exactly GOTY material, not with these issues, not with the bugs and definitely not with the interface on PC.",painterkilla

Every single thing here belongs to MMO. God dammit, even reagents have that wowish glow on them.This is why this game is so ultimately boring and offers absolutely nothing beyond the first few hours. Nothing will change just after you leave an introductory area and tutorial. Only numbers will go higher, and you will be stuck doing the same quest all the time in MMO dungeons (corridor - arena with enemies - corridor - boss encounter - grab loot - repeat). The world design, its story, characters are your typical MMO setting you don't give a single crap about. Every single quest is ""gather X"", ""kill Y"", ""go to place Z and discover it's an ambush and fight boss"". Your character development and equipment pacing go exactly along MMO pattern. The overgrown environment doesn't leave any field for speculations.Truth to be told, Kingdoms of Amalur shows how every single post-wow MMO would look like played in single-player mode. A boring shell with no real substance to it, because the only strength of MMO games lies in the multi-player element. Kingdoms would be your typical, generic MMO that went F2P after few months since its release with a really small player-base playing it because their friends play it. They would play it not because Kingdoms were good, they would play it because they can spend their time with their friends. If not Kingdoms, it could be any other MMO title, really.The most blistering thing is that you can literally run your way through after few main quests to the end, ignoring every single thing, to encounter the boss fight that is a poor QTE cut-scene.I bought it for like 2€, so I can't be mad I lost my money.

Compared to the recent PC editions of Fallout, though, Skyrim is relatively clean, and I only ran into one unexplained crash in over 90 hours.- Companion AI still leaves a lot to be desired, especially when they keep running into the path of your spells and arrows.- The Dawnguard DLC makes it way too easy for shopkeepers and other useful-but-not-essential townspeople to die.Skyrim is one of the most impressive games ever, and holds up incredibly well after half a decade.",R77

Following the main story missions is what makes this game shine.2) Open world graphics! Might not be as good as on PC, but depending where you are or what you are doing the graphics of this game can go from good to gorgeous. The lights, details on the streets, the water, flying the plane. Brilliant.Now, this game can be definitely be improved in these aspects:1) The shooting parts. The animations are smooth and look cool yes, but it handles extremely SLOW. Also, whats with the auto aim? It ruins all the fun, seriously.2) Driving. OK... how many GTA's have been released now? If one of the main features in the game is stealing cars and driving around, why is the handling so damn BAD?? The brakes are super super sensitive, the handbrake makes the car slide into infinity, and it's just close to impossible to take corners in a satisfying way with a fast car.Overall, excellent game, well worth the money. But in my opinion it can be improved a lot. I'd rather have a game with less content but good handling.",Bastrix

After being hooked on playing against others I had to try to get back into the story mode and I did and yes it keeps on getting better and now I have a very tough decision each night on what mode to play.

Saints Row 1 provided a solid main story line, a well designed sandbox, and plenty of over-the-top side quests and activities to do, many of which became quite challenging. Saints Row 2 upped the ante on juvenile, over-the-top, activities but the core really remained the same: Engaging single player story, good sandbox, lots of side quests and activities to do.Saints Row: The Third, by contrast, has gone all-in on juvenile, over-the-top action to the point that it forgets what made the game successful in the first place. The main story is short, most of the ""missions"" are only about the length of SR2's ""activities"", and is utterly nonsensical. In SR1 and SR2, the story was about your rise in the Third Street Saints and keeping the Saints relevant, respectively. In SR3, the story is about trying to remember your ""gangsta roots"" while fighting factions that make little sense in a meaningless town.Furthermore, Volition has cut down the number of side quests and activities by half, or more, over SR1 and SR2. Activities and side quests are now found in your ""phone"" rather than on the map, with exception to territory take overs,  and are limited to assassinations, survival, and vehicle thefts. SR3's sandbox is largely unchanged but Steelport feels much less lively than Stilwater (less pedestrians, less traffic, et cetera) and with less than half the side quests and activities as previous games, the fun of running amok destroying things wears off in very short order.Respect, which was a meaningful metric in SR1 and SR2, has become a joke in SR3 and has become nothing more than a simple level mechanic where you get ""XP"" (err, Respect) for EVERYTHING you do, Saints related or not. Buy a new chain necklace? Instead of a Respect modifier, you just get a set amount of Respect outright.I must also include a word about PC performance. This game has been out well over a year and it still suffers from graphical slow down and stutter lag while in a vehicle. Even on my rig (i7-3770, 16gb DDR3 1600 RAM, GTX 660 Ti) capable of playing Sleeping Dogs at maximum settings and Tomb Raider and Bioshock Infinite on high with DX11, Saints Row The Third chugs down to 35-45 fps while in a vehicle on MEDIUM settings. This is a well documented issue on the Saints Row official community and happens on all brands of video cards and CPUs. Volition kept promising to address the issue but have not as of yet deciding, instead, to focus on DLC and Saints Row 4.This game fails to keep me interested even though Saints Row 1 and Saints Row 2 are two of the few sandbox games I played to near 100% completion. While Rockstar has decided to take their sandbox franchise seriously, Volition has decided to take the other extreme by making Saints Row so over-the-top and juvenile that they've lost their way.",Captiosus

It's refreshing to see a developer make the game they want in today's game industry, rather than rehash games that did well before or make something mind-grudgingly easy for the kids. This game has, hands down, the most perfectly done multiplayer I have ever seen in a video game. I played this entire game with a massive nerd boner. Must-play.",selkies

That's like saying having a limited budget in a management sim less managerial.There is no real time counter ticking down, you have to be tactical in your approach to survive the turn limit. None of the missions require you to kill all of the aliens within the turn limit anyway. You have to make the tactical decisions that let you turn off the timer. You got alot of tools in your belt to get to the timer location, armor that lets you walk through walls, remote hacking with a specialist, blasting a hole in a wall with explosives, a ranger that is still in concealment while the rest of the team lays down fire, the list goes on.The turn limit reinforces the theme of the game and provides a link between the overworld strategy and the low level tactics. You are on the clock, humanity's days are numbered, if you take too long the aliens will win. You are a desperate and hounded resistance movement going against incredible odds.Another criticism is the reliance on random events. Which I define as a core feature of the gameplay. This game is all about managing risk. You don't put all your Colonels in one mission, you don't dash out max distance into the fog of war, your plans don't rely on a single point of failure. All this risk management has to be weighed against the clock, adding another layer of complexity.Finally there are the bugs. This I have no counter to, the game is buggy as hell. Granted the majority of the bugs are graphical, and I haven't run into anything particularly game breaking. Also the text in item descriptions and tooltips outright lies in some places.

Every time I play this game, it gives me hope that we will get a really great F Zero game on the Switch as this game is exactly like F Zero. The only difference being the mechanic of switching color phases. The two colors you switch to are blue and orange, and you have to swap between the two to boost on the corresponding color panel or to make corresponding jumps. This game is also crazy fast. Not F Zero GX fast, but fast enough to make the Switch run circles around other handheld devices.My only complaint is newcomers getting used to the controls. Every time I played this at college, I had to constantly remind them what the boost button is or how to lean on corners. The game is quite technical, as people I play with locally tend to come last place. Overall though I think this is a great eshop title and hope to see more from Shinen on the Nintendo Switch.",EAPyoutube

Sadly, many Bethesda fanboys will rate it as a 1 or 0 simply because it does not have the exact same aspects and gameplay as a Bethesda game. I know I will get many ""not helpfuls"" for this but I'm gonna go ahead and say it. Oblivion is garbage. Complete and utter trash. It has the worst leveling system of any game I've ever seen and the combat is boring and repetitive. The story is also more cliche than even this game. Fallout was a little better, but Bethesda is not the topic at hand. This game has excellent combat, hundreds of possible conversation permutations, a story that might not be the most original, but is at least somewhat compelling, and for the most part, good voice acting. Some people dislike the combat, which is understandable. This is not a game that can be played in real time. If you want to be successful in this game past the easy difficulty, then a very good amount of time will be spent in the pause screen queueing up attacks for your 4 party members to carry out at once. Each fight feels a little different and must be tackled with a strategy appropriate for the enemy you're facing. As stated earlier, the story itself is rather cliche, but the characters and the game world make up for it. The only thing that I could possibly see as a negative is the lack of an outside world to roam around in, which isn't always a bad thing, and should be expected from a bioware release. Travel is basically instant, and you always end up going where you originally intended to go. Oh yeah, @RichardS, no. Just because YOU cannot play the game above the easy difficulty setting does not mean this game is incomplete. ""Babysitting your team"" is how the game is designed. You are not playing one character, you are playing four. The description of the easy setting even states ""best for players who expect to play in real time."" If you can't handle that, I guess you're simply not intelligent enough for this game. It's not the developer's fault you wasted your money on a game you're too stupid to play.",MattM

I haven't been this addicted to a game for a very long time! It seems that peoples only trouble is the extent to which it is an original game? My argument is that the fantasy genre has been done so many times that its hard to innovate. There is the danger of being so bogged down in doing something new that it ruins the game, the storyline becoming too convulated and weak. The game play becomes complicated in its innovation, and it becomes tedious to play. The only problem with a lack of originality is that because you have seen it all before it doesn't stimulate you.

There is a way around this and it involves you grinding through the boring, unintuitive combat system where you spend most of the battle waiting for your cooldowns and for your abilities to charge up so they actually do damage.The quests are also the worse thing ever, if they are the new explorers of this planet shouldn't they be taking notes of where the creatures are and the items they are finding, but no they just write down their name down and the area of the GIANT landmass cause why would we need to find that enemy. The worst quests are the ones you have to pick up items, which in this game is completely randomly as it's just magical floating crystals, which you just have to run through and you can pick up the engine of a random mech but who the hell knows  cause you have no idea where the item crystals which contains the item you need.Let us compare this game to another RPG I have recently been playing Dragon Age: Inquisition, in DA: Inquisition the combat feels smooth and not a pile of wank, also you have the ability to heal in battle without the need for the grinding of several classes which will take you approximately 20 years in Xenoblade.

FIFA used that horrible Momentum so you can not play the game as you think you can play it. Why nobody talk about that Momentum? I dont feel free in FIFA i have no crontoll over the gameplay in many situations. That ruins the fun so FIFA got that Momentum with that Momentum is not possible to crontoll anything you all know that so i ask you why you lie about the most important thing in videogames: the gameplay.Without a good gameplay is doesnt make fun and that's why i give FIFA a 5 of 10, 5 for the license, for the ulimate team.

69968,Final Fantasy X,PlayStation2,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I've loved every Final Fantasy game made before next generation systems came out (13 was terrible IMO) but none of them ever made me fall in love with the characters as perfectly as this one did. I actually cried when Tidus faded away. Imagine that, a little fat kid sitting in his chair on a Friday night crying over pixels. It happened.This game didn't invent the premise of RPGs nor did it do anything overly revolutionary with regards to battle sequences or graphics, but the story was simply amazing. I grew to absolutely hate Seymour and my heart broke when Auron's true motive was revealed. The settings were whimsical without being stereotypical and the sphere grid remains my favorite RPG leveling system ever.I felt like this game, along with FFX12 and Legend of Dragoon didn't get the praise they deserved from critics because those critics expected the same kinds of things that they currently expect from huge franchises who are stuck between a rock and a hard place. It's impossible to fully revolutionize a successful series without changing something about its successful past and I think that's evident in the lacking grades on here. I think the remaster of this game is bringing it back to life and I'm excited about it.FFX remains one of the best games I've ever played and, as far as stories and character development go, may be the best I've ever encountered. I've played hundreds of RPGs from front to back and none of them kept me quite as engaged as FFX did. Hats off to the incredible development team and especially to the musicians who made this score; music is always forgotten in movie and game reviews!",mycarisorange

I would say Mario 3D Land looks slightly better overall, but Uprising just feels so much more vast and impressive even in the on rails air sections.  Speaking of the air sections are a blast to play.  Think something along the lines of Sin and Punishment 2 for the Wii, but offer a greater choice of weaponry and as a result give a slightly more varied experience.  The controls for these sections are pretty fluid and it feels really fast paced and action packed.  The other main gameplay style of the game are the ground sections.  These offer full control over Pit as you defeat Medusa's troops to progress forward.  These sections are varied with different kinds of cool and unconventional platforming elements are seldom feel stale.  The only criticism is with how these control.  Not the responsiveness of it since everything feels tight and responsive but more how cramped it can feel.  However, one can quickly adjust and as a result properly enjoy all the amazing things Kid Icarus has to offer in terms of gameplay and content.  In typical Sakurai fashion, this game has loads of content.  More so than any game on the 3DS so far and it makes Mario 3D Land looks absolutely minuscule by comparison.  Various multiplayer modes, weapon collection and customisation, numerous difficulty settings.  This game has so much to offer.  All this coupled with pleasant and light-hearted story, amazing soundtrack, great level of overall challenge and accessibility and excellent presentation, Kid Icarus Uprising is easily the best game on the 3DS.",Jorad

There is also a new game+ feature where you can start over with all your items and skills.The weapons are varied and the crafting system is pretty neat. You can upgrade weapons with different types of add-ons to give them different properties. There are a good variety of add-ons but many of them do the same thing (just a bit better). Even the guns in the game are pretty satisfying to use.The cooperative feature is good, with drop in - drop out at any time. It even has a display showing when another player is nearby when you're playing solo and then it gives you the option to join their game.The gore is great, you can hack off limbs or bash in heads or break bones all the while blood splatters everywhere and your weapon gets soaked in it. If you want a splatterfest, go with the sharp weapon expert and hack away.Bad:It's very glitchy. I haven't come across anything gamebreaking but I've seen my share of unintentional bugs. For example some of the cars become invisible but people can still drive them. One of the attack moves wont activate if the zombie you're trying to do it on is hit by something else (which is frustrating).Invisible walls, this becomes most apparent in the 3rd act. You might feel like exploring but you can't stray off the road like you would expect from a sandbox game. You'll meet glitchy terrain, invisible walls, big holes you can't get out of easily, stretched textures and all that good stuff.The difficulty is pretty much non-existant as long as you pick the right class. Almost every single zombie you meet will fall over if you jumpkick them and kicking normally doesn't cost anything so they wont ever get up. All zombies have weaknesses to exploit but in the end, there isn't really anything challenging.What you have in the end is a fun, addicting game with a fair share of problems. The overall experience makes up for the big lack of polish.

Not to mention how the pelican bears a striking resemblance to the transport in Aliens. The guns are all copied from Aliens, and what the movie had in deadly and mysterious enemies Halo miserably lacks. Throughout the whole game there are only about five total enemies each with of course one way to kill them or else you'd be wasting ammo. There are miserably weak grunts which are minute aliens who do nothing then an enormous leap is made to the elites which simply slaughter all your squadmates (they never last more then the first battle) and the shield toting aliens who are just plain annoying with their weak guns and stupid shields.

Snapmap is a surprisingly easy-to-use level creator capable of creating entire in-depth levels and unique enemy encounters, allowing cooperative and competitive four-player community-created experiences. It's really quite impressive, and there are already several thinking-outside-the-box modes such as a farming simulator and tower defense mode. The possibilities are truly limitless, and to make it better, it's being constantly updated with further creation tools.The multiplayer mode will either be a total disappointment or a pleasant surprise depending on what you were looking for. It uses a loadout and level up/prestige system, demolishing its potential for a classic arena shooter experience, but the gameplay is still just as solid, responsive, and polished as the single player campaign. That said, the vortex rifle paired with a shotgun is kind of the ultimate loadout, at least at the moment, due to both weapons being reliable high-hitting damage dealers. Overall, give multiplayer a shot and see if you like it. If not, you still have a solid campaign and map creator to sate your demonic bloodlust.",Dark_D3s7r0y3r

The map is a generous size and very nicely detailed, you definitely get plenty to explore and keep you busy.  I never count graphics into my reviews for a game, but Rockstar certainly delivered there.My gripes are...1. Outside of the 3 main characters, there's only maybe 1 or 2 other interesting characters that you interact with, unlike in other releases where I found the characters to be vastly better.2. For a game that was supposed to be centered around heists, there isn't that many, and they drastically overhyped how much control and input you have on them, along with being kinda dull in the first place.3. The missions are more detailed and involving than previous titles in the series, but the game still seems way too short, and the side missions aren't that spectacular.4. The story didn't click with me... this goes back to the ""Heist"" part, outside of that, you do some mundane little tasks for each character.5. The online, while a GREAT idea in theory... not really that well implemented. GTA online is a perfect candidate for something called a ""Beta"".  I'll admit, after they made it somewhat ""stable"", it was enjoyable for a few days, then it either deleted all of my characters progress (many times), or the cloud storage was down, etc.Overall, I'm sure rockstar busted their butts to make this game, it just didn't do it for me like the other games in the series, outside of online, it's a quality game like every other Rockstar release.

The online play is your standard fair for a racing game, but they also have playground play lists like infection, and cat and mouse etc. I had a lot of fun playing with friends online and its interesting because every time you rank up, you get a lottery and you can win anything from 4500 credits,  to a new car, or even one million credits.

The Open World aspect adds nothing to the game at all, it just means more ball-ache getting from one objective to the next, and everything you can find is usually already revealed by a marker. And the story - whilst OK - isn't anywhere near as gripping, deep or surprising as TW2. The Wild Hunt are barely for the first 20-30 hours. It's a real slog in all honesty, and the great bits which are in there are spread too thin over a mountain full worth of dull filler & fluff.

Multiplayer is fun but passable compared to the other bigs in the genre. The FACT is: Dead Space 2 is unique game in the survival-horror genre and don't hesitate to pick this one up because  in this genre this is the future.",victor1103

better idea about whether or not this game will make it to yor console if in fact you are on the fence.ive been around forever and have enjoyed gaming as far back as i can remember but i must state firstly that i own both major consoles andwell i just started doing reviews here and reasons being are for my non-biased and fair opinion of a game i have played/are playing hence giving you a better idea about whether or not this game will make it to yor console if in fact you are on the fence.ive been around forever and have enjoyed gaming as far back as i can remember but i must state firstly that i own both major consoles and a p.c. and dont go with the fanboy flow. i put a game in and press play and tell you what i think and judge a games content regardless of the category of game it falls under(sports, f.p.s.,rpg,mmo etc),in other words ""well this isnt my kind of game so i give it a 5"" will never come out of my mouth. w/ that said i look for the key ingredients(gameplay,graphics/visuals,sound,controlsreplay worth and fun factor. of course story is judged if in fact there is one.) which fulfill my gaming cravings and if there are a few extra spices thrown in,well then a game like deus ex comes to mind. i did not know what i was jumping into here, i just know that here we have a p.c. to console and usually its not a smooth transition(port). but as all games i do my best to keep all thoughts to a min, and try and keep my mind clear when playing in order to game w/o any mental obstacles. so as i wait for the games first cut scene to finish i was own my way to being an augmented alex jensen via ps3 and right away i notice that the game is promising in regards to a detailed and story driven game,hopefully this will be the case up until the credits. while playing im noticing the ample amounts of boxes and tunnels for which was disturbing to some but to me i couldnt rationalize knit picking over ""too many boxes"" and then speaking about them in a review as to say ""thus i had to take a point away',lol. graphically i was loving my surroundings and the textures were smoother than i expected and so the visuals were good, a few hours into the game i felt like i should make some coffee because im ready for the long haul, i want to see what happens next and w/ when cut scenes would surface i would welcome them rather than skip, which is something i have done w/ many games, but not this one. i felt like i would cheat myself out of a story which i was becoming more and more involved with. choices, yes there are many and you can tackle this game being non-lethal or an enraged alex jensen who will shed blood to find to the truth or you can combine the 2, which i did but it was not by choice,lol.. it was an error on my part. so right away i am saying to self ""i must play through this again without anyone getting hurt other than the bosses which the element of choice is no longer apparent. some of the augmentations , after finishing the game, i realized i wish i had activated earlier and this i will/am during my second play through. mostly first person but will show alex in 3rd person when in cover, sneaking around. some will argue that it should have been done one way or another, i argue that the remedy worked for me. the inventory can be upgraded by priaxis points(which is how you upgrade all your aug's, priaxis kit's can be bought also if you have the money to afford them) and some weapons i.e. rocket launcher is demanding of space, alot of it, last time i checked these were very big and bulky weapons so it makes sense. well the story is picking up, no hiccups in that department, its getting strong and so is alex. what really appealed to me was how creatively this was put together and some are the visuals are works of art, using colrs which many games will dare not even blend into a game, this one tends to be its own game and likewise with its choice of backdrops and use of color. the guns feel nice, and yes the also can be upgraded which i wont get into , but lets just say you will be happy with the results of your fav gun when fully upgraded. the map designs where nice and also had a very direct way marker system, i could go on forever about all the content in this game, there tons of it. so lets get down to what may shed some light on deus ex from my opinion. its a game which pulled me in, and never let me go. i was thinking about this game well after i finished it and  i wanted to do it all again, just for the sake to see what couldve been ,might have been and what not. and the last time i felt like this was w/ mgs4 and no i am not comparing the 2, just giving an example, thats how i felt. there is alot of content and goodies w/ this game. there are times when i was in my chair , eyes wide open, tired physically but i needed to see more. the game gave me an exp which i have not had in quite some time on a console. and this is in my opinion, a must add to collection, a must own and more importantly, a must play.palms sweaty, which way do i go, have to get my hack skill up, do i need to max out my cloaking, what gun should i drop to make room for this one, ladder or tunnels, gotta find that security hub, thanks 4 a great game edios , front 2 back",BOSTONJOHN32

Little insects crawling all over my gas mask in combination with a couple of flies landing on my legs in real life, sitting in the dark while going through unlit areas filled with webs and their creators: mutated spiders that sneak up on you from behind - truly a great game when it comes to setting the mood.The game's story is alright. It allows the player a few decisions in an attempt to make a very linear game feel not as linear. Personally I feel that this could have been better executed (more options, dialogues and consequences please) but overall the story is still alright and fairly catchy - the plot twists were also a great touch.The gameplay I would characterize as solid. The action parts and combat are good and the boss fights are not as facerollingly easy as in many other FPS games. Stealth in the game feels a little unpolished but is a nice addition, since it allows you to solve the game with a different approach than that of full-fledged Bazooka Joe. The forced interactive cutscenes are also not as frustratingly bad as those of Battlefield and Farcry 3, which is a huge plus in these days of game development.TLDR:Overall I think the game deserves some applause. It is a solid contribution to both the FPS and Post-apocalyptic genre and I hope to see more games like it in the future. Metro: Last Light is not perfect, but it is one of the games that is worthwhile both playing and supporting. 7.5/10",Muzze

Set inOne of the very few games which I give a perfect score to, Persona 4 Golden has made it onto my list of all time favorite games, a list which is usually only dominated by nostalgia! The Vita version of this classic PS2 jRPG includes a new ""true"" ending to the story as well as a new ""bad"" ending, an updated soundtrack, and new social links. The game itself plays like a detective RPG. Set in the small town of Inaba, the player goes through a year making friends and investigating a string of murder cases which upset the tranquility of your new town. The gameplay sports an intuitive turn based battle system where your relationship to your fellow party members can determine the actions they may take in battle. The tried and true turn-based gameplay which jRPGs are so famous for is enhanced through the amazing vocal soundtrack which seems to bounce in beat with your party and keep even the most mundane of fights feeling exciting. In the game you can collect various ""Personas"" which level up and learn new moves as they progress. Fusion of these personas is also extremely handy to create powerful new personas and give you and your allies a wide range of tactics to employ. The story in the game is absolutely top notch, from each ending and each social link you gather an extremely in depth and developed view of each of the many major characters in the game. The mystery keeps you guessing who the killer is, and the social aspects of the game allow you to become extremely connected to the various characters who all have their share of very human character flaws. When not dungeon crawling, you are able to control the daily life of the main character and choose your path through Inaba. From when to complete homework, where you want to work as a part time job, and even if you feel like going to bed early, there are plenty of options which the game offers. Persona 4 Golden is an experience I won't soon forget, the title lends credence to the quality of the game. It is quite Golden, and as such deserves a 10/10",Sploolordcam

Simply put, the high detail and realism just aren't enough to mask bigger flaws in the game. Length of game: 10 hours - 40 hours Gameplay: 7/10 I like the openness of each area and the mixed tactics to assaulting every outpost or location. Unlike a traditional straightforward first-player shooter such as the Call of Duty series, the game will allow you to approach each enemy differently depending on the weapons and your individual style. I also like the strict first-person view through the entire game. From shooting enemies to reviving allies to performing surgery on yourself, the camera focuses on how your individual character would act. However, there are MANY flaws in the AI: first, they respawn much to fast to be realistic. (Walk/Drive away from an outpost and come back and fresh troops will replace the ones you just killed minutes ago.) Second, the AI's ammunition isn't realistically consistent. (Keep an enemy with a mortar alive and he'll keep firing shells even past pounding a mile-deep crater into the ground.) Third, the AI takes way too many bullets to kill. (8 AK-47 rounds to kill a guy without a shirt on.) There are many other first-person actions that are very much simplified (like checking ammo in a clip and repetitive stabbing motions with the machete), but those would only be the icing on the cake here. Graphics/Animation: 10/10 Some of the most realistic I've ever seen in a game. With the graphics setting on your computer turned up to the highest, the fire blazes very realistically and the sun's glare catches you when staring directly at it. The AI doesn't seem to have a leg or arm sticking out in a random place, so that helps. Only fault here is the tremendous amount of computer power required to run the game at full graphics quality, but this is a necessity for all high-end PC games. Sounds/Acting: 3/10 The sounds of the game are horrible. What little music there is happens to be completely boring (and much too quiet!) and only makes the game less appealing as a FPS. The only positive here is the action music, which will make your heartbeat race during an intense firefight. The game's voice acting is absolutely horrendous. The actors make no breaks in speaking and do not sound the least bit realistic, especially for a game that strives on realism and higher quality. The game is also very serious and humorless, and even the jokes that the actors make are overshadowed by the darkness and bleakness of their surroundings. Replay Value: 1/10 Absolutely NO replay value whatsoever. At the beginning you have a choice of many different characters, but the choices you make don't affect the missions/gameplay that you end up with. Also, the missions you can perform are very tedious and repetitive. Assaulting an outpost or area becomes the same, over and over, killing enemies or destroying a target or talking to an NPC. Essentially, this becomes the backbone of the game, and absolutely kills the replay value. However, if you like doing the same thing over and over again, this game (and a job on an assembly line) may be perfect for you. Multiplayer: 5/10 Not much to say here, other than the fact that the multiplayer has a Call of Duty-based style. In fact, I would prefer multiplayer over single player because of the fact that you fight human players instead of repetitive computer AI that repeatedly hurls itself at you. Despite its multiplayer mode, I would have prefered that the mods sacrificed the multiplayer and instead focused on working out single player improvements. Lack of a co-op (2 player) campaign also deducted points from this category. Player Created Mods/Addons: 2/10 Little player support here in the way of modding capabilities. Ubisoft has ignored players' requests to include SDK (which would allow much expanded player modding capabilities) and the most people can do is make new maps for multiplayer. Final Comments: I would NOT recommend this game. Most gamers (especially those who enjoyed Far Cry 1) would be severely disappointed with the outcome and gameplay of Far Cry 2. Why do old games with horrible graphics but incredible gameplay (such as Counter-Strike Source and Half-Life 2) remain popular even today? The uniqueness of their gameplay overshadows their lack of graphical detail. Although this game has excellent graphics, a very realistic world, and open choice in gameplay, the repetition and slightly problematic AI for single player causes this game to go down under.",JoshS

I hate leveling.  And I love leveling in Guild Wars 2.  It's incredible.  I've barely scratched World versus World and structured PvP, and those are my main goals in the long term.

Punch, counter rinse and repeat. The invisible predator mode is the best thing about the game and is the only thing that keeps it from an even lower score in my book. Another thing is that game is really easy as the puzzles are moronically simple to solve. Seriously, if you can't beat this game in under 8 hours then you are doing something wrong. It's short but doesn't offer much replay aside from the little fighting room mini game with the Joker. The musical score is amazing, voice acting is amazing, story is good, graphics are top notch but that can't save the core game from being extremely shallow and generic. The RPG system where you level up techniques using XP is as simple as it comes. Why even have it if there is no depth? Why not just automatically upgrade attributes. At the end of the day I would say Infamous offers more value for the money and a better experience. This game is really only for Batman fanboys. I can't see myself playing this after I get the platinum trophy which I'm only few trophies away from doing right now.

Another thing I didn't like was the secuinces where your operating some form of vehical, instead of feeling like a fast paced high action little extra in the game, it was a boring, tedious, unpolished snorefest that I was just dying for to be over. BUT, on to the positive, let me say that Bayonetta (while in it's normal action sequences and boss fights) is the most fair, highly polished, and fun action game I've ever put my hands on. Not once in Bayonetta did I think, ""okay, yeah, that was REAAAAAL fair there guys, just gonna give no fair warning on that huh?"" every time I died I knew it was my fault, and I knew that there was somthing to do about it. I love that in games, and it's really what hardcore action gaming is all about in the end. So, in conclusion, If you are an action gamer (like myself) you will LOVE Bayonetta. But Bayonetta is not a perfect expirence and comes with more flaws than I can count on two hands, if this game didn't have such a confusing, horrendous story line it would have gotten a 9, and if it didn't have several unpolished lame driving senquences , it would have been getting closer to perfect, scrach the jaw droppingly bad voice acting, and to some, and to me, you might have yourself a 10.",MichaelH

I wonder how many players even managed to hear 50% of the total dialogues?Anyway let's get to the flaws. Slow pacing is a very obvious flaw of this game. You spend hours and hours on this game doing missions and mini-games, yet the story is still getting nowhere. The long loading screen after every map transition also doesn't help at all.Quality of the game gets worse towards the end of the game. The trend started at the end of disc 3. The dungeon is so unnecessarily long playing the game becomes a chore. More pronounced is disc 4 where Shenmue 2 gets very strange. It becomes a cinematic game. There is no fight, you just walk and talk for hours, wondering if the conversations are going to end. Then immediately after arriving at your destination you get to the shocking ending. I think that's when the developers realised they were developing for a dead console so they just decided to get it over with. I can't blame them, yet I can't help but feel the ending is a let down after such an epic journey.",crimsondoor

111267,L.A. Noire,PlayStation3,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This is the first non-military game I remember playing since Deja Vu: A Nightmare Comes True that takes place in the 1940's, and I've found L.A. Noire to be everything I've come to expect from Rockstar Games, but without missions that involve a huge number of explosions, and cars that explode after taking too much damage.  For better or worse, the game doesn't take on a true story line until reaching the arson desk, and if you look closely at Cole's notebook, there's boxes for Traffic, Homicide, Vice, and Arson, and when you get to the Vice Squad, it's pretty obvious just where Cole goes after completing the Vice Squad cases.  (Burglary and Red Squads were mentioned in the game, and you'd think that the game could have added boxes for those detective squads to preserve some of the element of surprise.)    The idea of switching main characters during the arson cases was also quite an interesting idea I never would have expected (so that the player can continue investigating, despite the LAPD keeping Cole away from anything resembling a house fire).  The only real downer, is that current events of 1947 weren't covered as much as I had hoped.  (The only time I really remember, was on the Homicide desk, when Cole and his partner share their thoughts about the ongoing Chinese revolution.)  I'm unable to rate particulars of the game like finding golden film reels and entering every vehicle as requirements for 100% completion of the game (since I've never cared for Rockstar Games and their scavenger hunts, but I have friends who enjoy the exploration), but I was bummed to discover that the only reward for 100% completion of the game, is a trophy.  (Is it really that hard to make a new outfit for Cole to wear)  But despite some of these shortcomings, I still enjoy this game very much, and have replayed my favorite cases many times since I got the game in 2011, and I find all of the characters believable, but to this day, Cole's decision to cheat on his wife on the Vice Squad case still seems non-sequitur.  (Unless Rockstar/Team Bondi were trying to make the point that the perfect 1940's woman is a Jazz singer with a curvaceous body.)",GOFLuvr

The amountThe next game in the wonderful Persona series, Persona 4 builds off of what made Persona 3 and FES so good and then adds some things to give it it's own identity that were both good and bad but mostly good. This game follows Persona 3 in the fact that it adds a simulation element to the RPG goodness to create a game that will literally have you playing for days and weeks on end. The amount of stuff to do in this game is staggering and I can honestly say this game, as well as Persona 3, will take you days to finish and that's a good thing. The combat is a fluid as ever, plus they've added the ability to control your teammates during battle now so no more questionable A.I. decisions from 3. It seems things have gotten a bit serious from 3 to 4 as your now dealing with a series of grisly murders in a small, rural town. For me, the story was the biggest improvement from 3 since in 3, the story is mainly just the run-of-the-mill ""save the world from the bad guy"" deal. This story was gripping and it really brought you closer to the characters in a way that 3 wasn't able to do. The multiple environments are a refreshing change of pace from 3's Tartarus and the enemies are a bit more varied in this version. However the biggest complaint I have about the game is the fact that it's way too grindy. The problem is they took the healing tarot cards from the after battle shuffle out, making things alot harder to deal with sometimes. Healing items are at a premium, even on easy, and the fact that you don't have a reliable healing avenue till the end of the game can make getting those needed levels very bothersome especially early on in the game. Just watch out since you'll spend most of your time each level grinding out the 10 or so levels you need to get from one boss to another to survive. It can be tiresome, especially since you have to kill each boss before a certain point or it's a game over. But the journey to get to those points is filled with alot of fun stuff and the simulation portions of this game are on par, if not better than the ones in 3. However 3 had a better collective of characters, while 4 only has a few characters that stand out (Teddy and Rise especially) over the rest. You will definitely enjoy all the characters you've got and it's nice to see that you can control their Persona evolutions on your own instead of having to wait for it to happen during the story. There are alot of other things I could talk about in this game but, suffice it to say, you should just play it for yourself if you haven't already. If you have, go play it again. It's far better the second time around than alot of the other stuff that's out there right now, especially if you have nothing else to do except wait for Persona 5 or the Persona 4 remake for the Vita to come out later this year.",Kenmei

133705,Call of Duty: Black Ops,PlayStation3,7,"After playing this game since release, I know feel I am ready to voice my opinions on this release. As is my standard way with any COD release, I play the campaign first just to get it out of the way. This is not why we buy this series its the online we want.

As is my standard way with any COD release, I play the campaign first just to get it out of the way. This is not why we buy this series its the online we want. However the offline campaign tends to give you an general overview of the production. The first thing that struck me was the drop in graphical quality from MW2, which I finally put down to a poor selection for the colour palette used in the majority of stages. The campaign for me dragged in the first half and just took to long for what play and content there was, the final half was completed easily in an hour which gave the feeling of the final production being rushed. But any Call Of Duty game will always be judged on its online game play. First impressions were good, but it soon starts to feel like MW2 with new maps and the levels with the still very poor colours are still there which lets it down. A good feature is that you can vote to replay or play the next map or random selection, this has meant I have been able to avoid the levels which are graphical unimpressive. The major down side of the online, connection problems, host problems, servers not being available or going down which is extremely annoying when you want to get a good evening of gaming in. Now, for the what I think is the pure genius revolution of this game over MW2 - Combat Training. This option is absolutely fantastic and redeems this game! Server problems, host problems, connection issues when playing online? No problem, fire up Combat Training and play bots on your favourite map. I actually enjoy this more than real online play, its so satisfying and more addictive than the real thing. To sum up, its overall a good game let down by a rushed and confusing campaign mode, and poor hosting online. Combat Training saves the day but once I reach the top rank once I will have had enough. I will then be back to Medal of Honor and COD4, with a cheeky visit for Combat Training every now and again.",Rob_Barker

One worry I had was that it would overuse the motion controls like most Wii games, thankfully it doesn't.Now, for what the game did wrong, it feels kind of linear because you go back to the first three areas twice, the difference each time you go back is that you explore new regions. People use this as an excuse to say that it's linear, but it's just an illusion. The other major thing I have issues with is Fi, she is by far worse than Navi.

Inventory management was a bit of a beast, but all things considered, among the top 10% of RPGs I've played. So I should love New Vegas, right? That's what I thought. It has been a chore to play. It all stems from the lack of connection I feel to the lead character. In FO3 we're born, we have a childhood, we're searching for our father, always one step behind. This story opens up with our lead guy being shot and left for dead, then revived by a guy who doesn't really like us...nor dislike us, and a town that is as ambivalent. Hoping to chase down the killers, as you're in the middle of a civil war, just doesn't create the same connection as FO3. My biggest complaint is level progression and mission management. It seems like about 2/3rds of the time, I'm underleveled for my current mission. Whether it's because I need to hack a computer above my science level, or pick a lock that is too hard for my character, it's just a roadblock and senseless push to fight the same enemies over and over again, to grind it out. To make matters worse, the loading screens are everywhere. At some point I started avoided going in to buildings, so I wouldn't have to wait 30 seconds to load, just to find out there was nothing of interest. Fetch quest ""quick teleport"" here, then there, then there, then back to the mission, and you've spent almost 2 minutes in loading time, 10 minutes of gameplay. That's not good.Throw in the constant need to drink from your canteen, find scarce ammo, repair clothes and guns...playing this game is a job. I already have a job, so my relaxing hobby of videogames, isn't where I hope to spend more time working.Lastly...if I wanted to read as much as this game requires, I would sit down with an epic novel. Hack a computer, then read 8 pages of small green text. Have a conversation, read 20 conversation branches that repeat over and over again. I LOVE the Mass Effect trilogy, and people bash that for all the conversations, but at least they are visually appealing, and I feel like there is a reason to have them. In FO:NV...it's just one chore to the next. Just a very disappointing game, in a franchise I have enjoyed. I have not finished this game, but I've invested over 30 hours, and as someone who hates abandoning a game part way through, I would be stunned if anything happens in the next 5 hours, to grab my attention enough to care to finish it.  On the positive side, I did not encounter more than 1 or 2 game-killing glitches in my 30 hours of play. Perhaps patches resolved those major concerns from early gamers.",RickyBooby

A fantastic bonus to this game is the ""Skirmish"" games adding many more hours of gameplay.

Real guns. Real locations Real people. Of course it's all the same because it's largely based on fact. If game developers started including lasers, homing-missile launchers and plasma guns it just wouldn't be right!

Negative comments aside, this game has the best outfield play that I've ever experienced in a footballing sim, and the defending is actually fun and rewarding when you get it right.

Just for scope and scale alone this package is a great buy, and the loving attention this collection has received is breathtaking, 4 Halo games remastered and polished, Halo TV mini series and the Halo 5 multiplayer beta and lots of other little goodies, just amazing switching between Halo games is effortless and the menus are easy to navigate in general. So aside from a few performance problems here and there, like drops in frame rate sometimes when saving or loading(which will most likely be patched out) this collection is a great blast from the past experience and lets us know again why we all loved Halo back in the day. So if you have already played all 4 Halo games and are not an avid fan of Halo i would wait a while until you have some spare cash and want to delve into this collection at a later time, but if you haven't played any of the Halo games before you will be in for a treat, the content in this collection will keep you entertained for many months, and the story!, there is no other like it!, for hardcore Halo fans? i don 't think i need to say a word, they are already playing this amazing collection of  the best sci fi first person shooter franchise ever to grace a console thus far.Enjoy  9/10 :)",WICKEDGAMER

New vegas however, being a little smaller but with better gameplay mechanics balances out everything that fallout3 had flaws with. Except perhaps the drab environment. (What more can you expect?

Yes please.Sins of a Solar Empire was for me a hotly anticipated game, given the potential for greatness that it showed, that is until it was released. While it was fun to play, with stunning graphics and a decent UI, it didn't really have any wow factor and it did, as some other reviewers have said, feel bland. There weren't that many ship models/types either, not to mention the fact that their designs were... unimpressive. I mean come on, capital ships are supposed to be awe-inspiring, but they weren't anything special other than they were a little bigger than normal frigates/cruisers. Although it is fun to conduct and watch massive fleet battles, I do admit.One of my biggest gripes is that there is so much potential and material for a single player campaign and yet there is none, which to me is a genuine travesty. That would have helped me (if done well enough) to get invested in the races. I understand what they wanted was for you to ""craft your own experience"" with each game, but they could have let that happen while also still providing a storyline of some kind.As for gameplay, combat is nice in that if you're more of a hands-on player it isn't too difficult (as long as you prepare properly with control groups and fleet assignments, though even without those it's not too bad) then you can control micromanage pretty easily. If you're more of a hands-off player, you can just send your fleet into the fray and watch the fireworks too. Though it could be argued that it is a little light on the strategy in that you can, if you wanted, simply build as many ships as possible and send them barreling towards your enemy  that isn't really the case since I've defeated enemies with bigger fleets before using backdoor/multiple front strategies or simply by having less, but more powerful ships in a battle.",Toffenuff

Sure, the puzzles are smart and well thought out, but after you solve them , the second time is not as interesting.  The story is just ""collect all of those things to save Zelda"". What about missions that are not fetch quests? what about the atmosphere?.To me, These are the most important factors to a Zelda game. Take for example Twilight princess . The game didn't innovate much in terms of combat and puzzles, but is still loved by zelda fans. Why is that?Because twilight princess has:1)the game has a scary parts, with spooky atmosphere and music.2)there are many lovable characters to meet in the game.3)you are free to explore the massive land.Skyward sword has none of those, except  maybe in the beginning of the game .It's a good game, and I'm glad that I played it.

I will repeat it again, the biggest disappointment is the main story, in his length, weird timeline and lack of depth.-Secondly, the hype building. I mean, you cannot hype a game for some years, cancel it, then bring it back as this half finished product.

Yeah Gladio is rough but caring, Prompto is hyper and punny, Ignis is the smart-type, however that is the only depth they all have. No character evolution, no revelation, nothing.In summary, if this game was from another serie, I wouldd maaaaybe give it like 7/10, but as a standalone Final Fantasy, it deserves a 4/10.

However, as the game went on, I began wishing the game would hurry up and end.  I was utterly bored and dissatisfied.  Here's why.1.  The graphics look awesome, but there's too much repetition.  The first time I saw a crashed train, I thought it was cool.  But later, I started thinking:  How many crashed trains ARE there in this city?  There were crashed trains EVERYWHERE.  I noticed more and more that there was a LOT of that kind of repetition.2.  I've come to the conclusion that they named this game Crysis 2 because they couldn't decide between the more accurate titles of ""Left Mouse Button:  The Game"" and ""W:  The Game.""  Once you stop seeing CELL troopers and are faced with simply large numbers of rather stupid (increasingly armored) aliens, you have only two choices.  You can armor up and shoot your way through.  The problem is that it takes a tediously long time to shoot any aliens.  I had aliens that could take two or three sticky grenades and still stay up, and some aliens would just soak up bullet.  It was boring.  The other alternative was to go stealth and sneak past them.  And that doesn't always work because if they get too close, they can see you anyway.  Sure, it adds tension, but I was disappointed to find that I wasn't really so stealth.3.  The voice acting in this game is awful.  Especially the guy who plays Lockhart with that fake southern accent.  It was dumb.  The acting was just dumb.4.  The aliens were stupid.  The AI was just awful.  I saw aliens running around in circles.  I had aliens walk RIGHT INTO oncoming fire.  I saw aliens run into walls.  I saw one alien repeatedly running into the same wall over and over.This game had so much potential, but so little follow through.  Here's what would save this game:1.  More varied environments.  Crashed planes, bodies, actual traffic accidents instead of just a bunch of individually wrecked cars.2.  destructible environment.3.  REAL stealth4.  Reduce the amount of damage it takes to kill aliens.  Let me kill them faster.  In fact:  let them kill ME faster too so that I have more reason to keep to stealth and cover.5.  Better voice actors who can act genuinely and without going over-the-top or using stereotypes.6.  Better AI.  Let the aliens use tactics, cover, proper movement etc.7.  Make the overall story more engaging.  Why are the aliens attacking?  Maybe have some detective work to FIGURE OUT how to defeat the enemy instead of having one lame:  ""Pull this lever to kill all remaining aliens"" nonsense.This game could have been a lot better.",slippery

186311,Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch,PlayStation3,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        A perfect example of a family friendly game that is deep and complex while still being accessible.Ni no Kuni is a very innocent and childish game on the surface but just like a good Disney or Ghibli movie it has just as much appeal for adults as it does for kids. It has a well thought out world with a deep history and the more I played the more I found I wanted to learn. The games' magic was also quite well thought out and made sense within the story as well as gameplay. The characters weren't as complex as RPGs like Persona or Final Fantasy, but they felt believable enough and each one had meaningful development throughout. By the end I truly cared about the cast and felt like they had grown immensely. On a technical level it looks and sounds great while offering very unique gameplay that is fun and rewarding. The more you play the better the game gets. I recommend it to all fans of JRPGs regardless of age.In terms of gameplay. There are many ways that it is exceptional. The menu system is one of the most intuitive and well thought out of any game I have ever played. Basically the whole menu system is part of a book called the Magician's companion. It includes everything you need to know about monsters you have enountered, your familiars, your characters, items, and spells. It is like an interactive book and it is so easy to use and enjoyable to look through. It is so good I really wish that more games had a menu system that is so robust while being easy to navigate. So many elements of the game are just really well thought out. For example as you get further in the story and reveal more of the map you progressively get better vehicles and abilities that make traveling long distances easier. It happens in a very natural way so that traveling to knew places always felt like a fresh experience but rarely felt like a chore. All of the methods of travel also made perfect sense within the context of the story. The combat system starts out very basic but as you learn new spells and tame more familiars, it progressively gets more interesting. By the end of the game I had so many spells and familiars that I genuinely felt very powerful. The way that new spells get unlocked also fits perfectly into the story making it all the more satisfying. There are a huge variety of familiars so I always felt motivated to discover new ones. Combat can be challenging but was never frustratingly difficult. The only major downsides of the gameplay is that exploration is pretty boring, on the field and in dungeons there isn't a lot that Oliver can do. There are a few field spells but those don't really do much to enhance the gameplay experience. Aside from that minor weakness though the gameplay is well above most JRPGs.The Story is surprisingly very deep. It is a great blend of intimate and epic. At first it seems like a simple journey for Oliver to save his mother but the further you go the grander the conflict becomes. I was genuinely surprised by just how deep the story went in the end and the plot was for the most part very well crafted. Each area you travel to reveals more about the world, its history and its problems. It is delivered in a way that is simple enough for a child to appreciate but it is deeper than most games targeted at a mature audience. It is clear that a lot of thought was put into the story and by the end almost everything is clearly explained. My only major complaint about the story is that I thought the final arc was a little bit disappointing, it isn't bad and it actually came as a surprise but I thought there was just so much potential for it to be far more than it was.  The reveal of Shadar's identity to me was very satisfying and then the reveal of the White Witch was also very satisfying. Their connection to each other and Oliver made a lot of sense. What disappointed me though was the reveal of the final reveal of the identity of the zodiarchs and the explanation behind their downfall. There was just so much potential to make the zodiarch and the White Witch more complex. I also thought the explanation behind the collapse of the ancient kingdom to be a bit too simple considering the deep history surrounding it. The way that the White Witch is defeated was also a missed opportunity to me it would have been so amazing if Oliver had to complete her heart by gathering every type of emotion from across the kingdom. They had all the mechanics and world building for it to make perfect sense. None the less, the story is amazing and full of surprises.Visually the game speaks for itself. I think it is one of the best looking games on the PS3. The cartoony style won't be for everyone but I think it will age exceptionally well. I think it still looks better than most JRPGs on the PS4.

The graphics and face animations... the cut-scene quality... the voice acting... the adrenaline shock from the first majini encounter... ButLet me start with saying that I never took a interest in the Resident Evil series... never. Somehow when the series started I was into LucasArts games... adventures... Star Wars... many years later I got a quick peek at the PC... and I was sold! The graphics and face animations... the cut-scene quality... the voice acting... the adrenaline shock from the first majini encounter... But playing on PC, there was never the option for me to do some Co-Op. A few months later my PS3 arrived and I had to get that sweet gory game for it. Since then passed something like 2 and a half months and I was still doing Co-Op damage in it.One thing I have to notice first... I really had the impression, that there were more enemies in the PC version... so that would be one minus point... but I didn't really count them, so whatever!First impression... the whole thing begins with an amazing cut-scene, featuring some of the best ""for game"" cinematic's I came across... the camera movement, the angles the editing... it is simply a good movie between the levels with amazing production values... why only a good movie? Well, the plot isn't that great and the dialogs are sometimes idiotic... but the voice-cast is so amazing that you can easily forget that the last line you heard is actually pretty stupid! The voice-cast and the facial animations... which are really outstanding... the eye movement, the eyebrows, the lips it is simply a joy to simply watch them two main heroes!So now lets talk about our main protagonists... Chris Redfield... as much as I love the way he was animated, I am not quite a fan of his muscularity... I mean the guys looks like a descended of Donkey Kong himself, just watch his ears! But besides that he is quit a likable character. On the other hand we have his always present female sidekick, which is simply anatomically perfect, no over sized silicon breasts (like most of the female characters designed for games), a beautiful face and as Chris a likable character.But what Sheva really offers is ""an excuse"" for the possibility to play the whole single player campaign in Cooperative mode with friends on-line! Of course there are in game button assigned commands to communicate within game, but a headset is definitely the way to go! I would especially recommend the original PS3 headset from Sony!The replay value in Co-Op mode is extremely high, when you got some folks to play with. People say the single player experience vs. the Co-Op experience is radically different... maybe, but the Co-Op is in my opinion the more fun way to play. Gathering the treasures and emblems and trophies together really is much more rewarding and you have to really work together to go through some game points to not waste amo or healing stuff. The difficulty level is somewhat unbalanced sometimes, you start with a very tough set piece followed by some easier points along the way, then you get to another hard point and so on and so on... but that is not really a complaint, more an observation about the games pacing.A minus point is the engine, which on one hand offers stunning graphics, but on the other hand really narrows your movement options. You can't jump over any given ledge, the game has to allow you this, the cover system is OK, but why do they reload before going back to cover after shooting, leaving you literally out in the open for counterattacks? Some might not like the fact, that you can't run and shoot, but this too isn't really that bad... one has just to rethink his game strategy.So if you like games which offer a spectacular presentation, but no really strong plot or dialogue (but perfectly voice acted and featuring likable characters), which offer amazing graphics and a ton of fun instead of a complicated game engine, then this one is the right one for you... for weeks, if not months!This game has some cons, but the pros definitely out wage them... so this is a 10 in 10 for me! The DLC are also worth the purchase!",Kondorr

I have had many a time being within a few carts of the finish line and being overthrown with spied shells, pows and red shells and get put back to 4 to possibly even 9th on one level. However, my 4th place Spike shell gain was rather interesting. Level designs are quite distinct, as there are 16 new levels as well as 16 levels from the old games, including a few from the SNES, which brings back memories. The online function is great, but isnt fair for players who dont play the single player game simply because they have neither the carts or bikes/characters to compete with die hard fans. This puts some players at a full disadvantage. I have to admitthat some of the souds/voices of characters have become childish, but what would be expected from companies that normally be designed for a younger age. I think it is not reasonable to realise that this game was not designed primarily for adults. However, i dont find the single player 150cc as challenging as others have, being as how 6/8 cups resulted in golds on attempt 1 which was rather a dissapointment for me.",JC

First, the good: Everything associated with this game is done well. From the gameplay to the story to the atmosphere, Crystal Dynamics has made a wonderful game that works very and, especially for a PC port, this game runs very smoothly and the flow it has makes it a great addition to anyone's collection. The small things are what gets in its way. For a game called 'Tomb Raider', there's very little tombs to raid and, the ones that are in there, feel half assed and added at the very last second. With no other reason to do them beyond getting the achievement, there's really no incentive to doing them. I was hoping there would be some big item to get at the end of the tomb thing but there was not. But this is a little thing that doesn't affect the outcome of the game and that outcome is a very good one. The biggest issue this game will face is from the competition it faces this month. Between GoW: Ascension and Bioshock Infinite and others, this game will get left in the dust by other games that will probably just be more memorable than this one.

VeryEnjoyable game with an above average story and great spectacle. Tomb Raider is the reboot of the famous series of the same name. It is about Lara Croft's first adventure, the one that defined her and turned her into the unshakable badass she is in the originals.In terms of gameplay, this is a very good third person shooter with stealth elements, and some enjoyable platforming. Very similar to Uncharted in that respect. You only have four weapons which you can upgrade throughout the game, and while this may sound boring, what else would you want outside of a shotgun, pistol, bow and machine gun? A different type of machine gun? The gunplay is fairly good, nothing amazing, but above average. The shotgun feels strangely weak when you actually use it outside of blowing destroyable walls with it. The platforming is fun, and the more cinematic scenes work extremely well with the platforming. The game is not very difficult aside from a few scenes which are shockingly difficult out of nowhere, although it could be more due to my extreme incompetence. I have not seen hard mode yet. The game is linear in a branching world. You will always go down pathways as the storyline dictates, similar to the PS2 action adventure Kya: Dark Lineage in that respect. The game is covered in quicktime events, although they are pretty lenient, and you'd need to reactions of a sloth to fail them. It is nowhere near as bad as Resident Evil in that respect.The soundtrack isn't incredible, with only a few great tracks, the rest just being acceptable.The graphics are nothing special, even for 360, but with how wide and open the areas appear (they are not actually wide open outside of the forest areas, which are pretty small) its understandable. The water effects look especially awful to a laughable degree.Story is above average, with great writing. It's heavily based around the supernatural tho, something not shown in the trailers.People have been complaining the platforming is way too easy compared to the old Tomb Raider games. Honestly, that's a good thing, they had stupid amounts of pixel perfect jumps in the old games, which were made worse by the delay before actually leaving the ground. Not going back to that is always a good thing in my books.Overall, a great game worse playing, but it is nor the greatest game ever made nor a literary masterpiece.

The game does a good job of retaining what makes MMO's great while innovating and finding new and creative ways to deliver content to players. Rather than the standard actionbar keypressing combat, we instead have a system that allows for dodging and one can use all of their abilities while moving. Instead of a traditional party system with tank, healer, and DPS (where really most people only want to do damage) we have abolished the trinity system and have replaced it with damage dealing classes and support classes, all fun player options that makes grouping up for dungeons easy and fun. Instead of the traditional questing structure of heading to a hub, picking up a huge bundle of quests, completing them all, and returning them, progressing through an environment in this game involves doing a combination of different events including exploration and platforming challenges as well as dynamic events and Guild Wars 2's answer to quests, reknown hearts. The game also takes a unique approach to PVE with the absolutely massive boss battles and invasions one can take up arms against as they wander throughout the world in the form of dynamic events. The game's PvP content is also innovative, including an awesome server-vs-server-vs-server option where three servers duke it out. These battles can get absolutely massive - even classic ""Huge"" battlefields in MMOs like old school Alterac Valley from WoW or Warhammer's massive battlegrounds don't compare. Then there are the small details - the little things that improve the game even more. The personal story is a nice touch to add some context to the game, the graphics and sound design are beautiful, being de-leveled upon entering lower level zones to be able to complete the content without feeling too powerful makes group play easy and allows you to play whatever you want whenever you want, having the ability to immediately deposit the items you collect for crafting into a tab of the bank from anywhere in the world is genius, and having an overflow server that prevents players from having to sit in a que just to play the game are all little strokes of awesome that make this game great.To top it all off, unlike other MMO's once one purchases this game there are no subscription fees whatsoever, and the cash shop in no way is pay for power. It's an incredible value that I would be willing to pay 15 dollars a month for if it were subscription-based.This is the most fun I've had playing an MMO in ages, and I think a lot of people share my opinion as I can see by the high user score (especially for an MMO, SWTOR and WoW expansions usually get yellow and red user scores) not to mention a really nice critic score thus far.

So i took a souvenir during F2P beta day (memories of potentially fun, simple game that looked like polished Battlefront or Team Fortress but was still more than that; more unique in a way as far as heroes and their abilities went). Sadly, that was all just a minigame, simple and unfinished but addictive enough to bait you into the real game that's hidden inside; and  what hid inside was a very, very dark place, exactly the same place that you can find in the Cs:GO or many modern games, and a place that will exist as long as 1st world players (be it 13 or 60), except to be treated like addicts, even when they're not, it's aimed toward those prone to addiction, vanity, and gambling. Those are the customers that every modern company aims for these days, and sadly, they keep coming back to play their slot machines, even though we all know ""the house always wins"". But unlike dangers and unappealing aspect of gambling and specifically slot machines, where everything and everyone warns you that you shouldn't spend money playing it, this road is paved by people shilling the game for you, You tubers with fake personas that ride every hype train and play along to the tune of the companies for their micro-share of the micro-pie, to soothe the vanity  and get their taste of fame, they will guide you to these games with fake ""omg amazing"" reviews, much like gaming journalists, only with more popularity and less rich vocabulary; there are no grannies with crutches standing in front of these slot machines, only people surrounding you pm-ing how cool you look in this or that skin, voice (new feature yay!), spray tag.""Just cosmetics"" just became part of your social/gameplay xp.Most games today, especially multiplayer ones, are just 1 hour expiration date minigames that guide you into the real game-online gambling, with everything produced by other fans and players, but restricted to people because you sold your soul at the start of the agreement policy, and everything you produce while playing or being inspired by the mini-game can be recycled, and will be recycled, as a new product you have to pay for, be it maps or ""mission packs"", but it is all focused and boils down to the gambling aspect where you roll for cosmetic features that games are centered on, and you receive by leveling (10% of them) or spending infinite amount of money (and I do mean infinite, the more you spend and obtain the lower the chance for the skins you don't have but want to drop, to drop). Online gambling trap=1/10; Minigame called Overwatch you will get bored by in first few hours: 7/10 (could actually be a promising game, but don't be fooled to think you can ignore the ""it's just cosmetics, silly"" because the game is all about those cosmetics, and everything will guide you to focus on obtaining all those silly cosmetics).TL;DR I cannot put this simpler: DO NOT BUY THIS. Just because you trust Activision-Blizzard (as good old Bobby Kotick said, explaining the WoW corpse yearly remakes: ""If we cannot run a game into the ground, we don't want it"" meaning if the game isn't addicting/cool enough for people to deal with micro-transactions (understatement of the decade=straight up ego stroking for money) and addiction/vanity mechanics hidden inside, we don't bother with it. This quote explains a lot about the inner workings of the gaming industry, and that means any company,not just EA and similar designated meanies, they ALL work on the exact same business model from Valve through ActivisionBlizzard to EA, with some being nicer to your face but pulling their pants down once you turn around, and other's getting caught with their hands in the cookie jar, but there is no difference behind the curtains; there is no magic, just same suits working on the same con to exploit you. It's gambling with a mini-game attached, not vice versa.In fact, best thing you can do for gaming atm, is play only single-player classics with no DLCs to pay for or completely lay off video games, cause they are in a very dark place atm, as far as consumers are concerned. Moneywise or industry-related, they are blooming like never before and putting movie industry to shame, exactly because people pre-order and ride hype trains just to realize all of it is introduction into gambling (only more polished than a real casino, with all the geriatrics or the elderly turned into T&A to distract you). It's nice for them to add some elderly character into the game, and some butch lesbian, and work on gender/age issues that suddenly became important; but when are we going to talk about much bigger issue of players-exploited, no matter the gender, and abusing psychology research a la Mengele to switch on addiction baits and turn players into chronic gamblers; or the fact that 2/3 of Pc owners can't enjoy most games with or without others",Karmafunkz313

The brand new Frostbite 2 engine makes the game seem almost like you're in a war, with the lighting and destructible environment and the massive scale of the environment around you. The multi-player makes up for the campaign as it offers hours worth of unlocking, instead of simply restarting the player 15 times. I have been playing as the engineer class the entire time and it took about 20 hours of playing time to unlock all weapons and gadgets. And after that 20 hours and receiving approximately 212 score per minute i have unlocked that, so it does take a long time to unlock. There is also many unlocks for many different things. About 12-18 weapon accessories(number of accessories depend on the weapon) for 53 different types of weapons, 10-16 unlocks(also depending on the vehicle) for 24 different vehicles. Also the battles seem more like wars, especially conquest. The player can be in one area of the massive maps and not even know the battles going on around them. While the infantry fights on the ground the jets are in massive dogfights above. For example, when playing conquest on Caspian Border, one fireteam(squad) may be holding a position and get dozens of kills for each player while the rest of the platoon is fighting for control of the other positions. Teamwork is also a major factor for Battlefield. It doesn't matter if your team is just a four man squad or if the entire 32 player team(for conquest on PC only) are working together you will succeed. Battlefield also offers players more things, just two months into the games release they are already offering a DLC with four maps ten weapons and three vehicles. Overall i would give battlefield 9/10 only because the campaign wasn't the best it could have been but all other aspects of the game are fantastic. i hope this helps anyone thinking about buying this game",Mediahog132

159555,The Witness,PC,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        [Brief Synopsis of Full Review]Unlike the largely linear experience presented in most puzzle games, The Witness actually allows you to freely leave a puzzle in progress in order to go solve other ones around the island. You also don’t even have to feel pressured to complete every single puzzle in the game in order to complete it, although I’d imagine that should probably be your goal if at all possible. In terms of storytelling, this jumping around isn’t prone to mess with much as the story is more of what you make it than really anything so established as a specific plot. Everything is all mysterious and nothing is ever quite fully confirmed, which definitely leaves things up to the player’s imagination which I thoroughly appreciated. You’re presented with the cold hard facts as they are- what will work and what won’t, and that’s simply that.Now, there is some loose basis of a slight hint of a plot to be found, and that is through select recordings scattered about the island in sometimes devious, sometimes easy-to-access areas. These won’t do much to quell the questions, but they may sate some of your burning desire to get to the bottom of things, if only a little bit before the game’s ending. None of this should really detract from the experience however as at its core, The Witness is a test of logic. There are frustrating moments, but nothing beats the thrill of successfully completing a puzzle or a series of puzzles and discovering something new about the world you’ve been presented. Instead of questioning the purpose of things or asking the horrid “why” question, start exploring and figuring out how things work and what affects what. It’s all almost brilliantly philosophical in some ways.Concept: Exploration and puzzle solving presented in a rich environment where no stone should be left unturned and no detail, however minimal ignored.Graphics: The art-style is uniquely rendered and attention to detail beautiful to behold. Some may consider it basic or simple, but then things don’t need to be unnecessarily complicated to be gorgeous.Sound: There’s more of an argument to be made for the ambiance than there is to be made for a soundtrack or voice work, but what there is of everything here is more than adequate and only adds to the sense that you’re isolated and surrounded by mystery.Playability: Complicated puzzles can sometimes make games an exercise in frustration, but you should never be angered by difficulty even when you are stumped as the game is precise and easy to grasp once you get the hang of things.Entertainment: It’s puzzle-solving at its finest or close enough thereto. Puzzle after puzzle will challenge how you think and what you know. Don’t stop to question motive or intent, but soak up the rich scenery and equally rich gameplay elements.Replay Value: High.Overall Score: 9.0",JohnWitten

In this case for instance, it can remind you of how much more compelling a relatively sleeper hit like the first Dead Space actually was.  It featured a unique, though not particularly original, eerie spaceship to explore, an excellent lighting engine and some pretty good monster designs, as well as a whole host of ""mining"" tools you could use to defend yourself from the ghastly things on board the Ishimura.  A lot of it seemed practical, barring the ""kinesis"" and ""stasis"" modules.  A lot of the weaponry seemed practical for a ship in space harvesting whole planets for rare metals and materials.  However, the chief focus of the original was what exactly?  It wasn't really scary, it wasn't really well written, featuring some pretty poor dialogue from all parties involved throughout the story line it would seem and aside from borrowed mechanics from other similar games, Dead Space didn't have a whole lot it could call its own.  It did have three things though, a story that didn't usually get in the way of very solid, satisfying gameplay, and a very good atmosphere accompanied by probably some of the best sound design in a science fiction horror game.  I really enjoyed the first game for primarily these reasons, but this is where the sequel slips up.  First off, the story is repugnant, its not interesting, its not fleshed out, I have no reason to care about Isaac anymore now than I did before, the characters are dull, the level design is much worse than the first games, and the sound design just doesn't have the charm of its predecessor.  Their is so much wrong with playing through the first twenty minutes of the game that I suddenly  remembered why I nearly quit playing on multiple occasions.  First off, our protagonist talks now, no explanation for it really.  He just talks now and unfortunately, he's had some pretty bad and utterly bizarre dialogue written for him as well.  Secondly, Ashley is now a psychotic ghost that can physically manifest itself to give Isaac empty threats, reminders of the ""past"" events, and to generally annoy him by causing infuriating quick time events and pausing the entire pacing of the game just to tell the player something to remind Isaac how bad he should feel for some reason.  I have a hard time understanding why, who, and for what reason this was placed into the game.  Seems to me theirs already plenty of conflict with rampaging aliens murdering everything in site, why on earth did the main character need to have this internal conflict with his very dead girlfriend?  Oh wait, that's right, because ""the marker.""  The marker is boring guys, it was left vague and unexplained in the first game for a reason.  All of sudden all these games are about some totally ambiguous and uninteresting alien artifact that humans have reversed engineered somehow.  Who even cares?  I can't think of one reason why this had to be in the plot.  Could've just been your standard fair, ""Everything is screwed up and we have to get out of here,"" plots, but I guess they've done that one already.  Thirdly, love interest.  I get it, Isaac has to have some woman involved with him on every nightmarish space engineering adventure he goes on.  However, this ones pretty unnecessary and silly.  The first game accomplished a sense of isolation that permeated throughout your play through.  Sure Hammond and the ""traitorous wench"" were on board the Ishimura too, but you were always in different parts of the ship.  No one in Dead Space 1 meets face to face aside from two or three occasions.  This kinda added to the atmosphere.  Everyone else was gone, it was literally just the three of you alive on the ship.  In Dead Space 2, they attempt to do this with the involvement of someone who is obviously very crazy and a female interest named Ellie.  Theirs a fourth character involved, but is essentially only there to cause conflict for Isaac and his group.  The real problem is, every time I've played through this game, I can't even really remember a single portion I enjoyed, it all just sort of blends together with really the only highlight being a brief section when you're back on board the Ishimura.  The cut scenes are numerous and kill the flow of the game, the Ashley subplot should've been axed by someone in the writing department before they threw it haphazardly into the game and Isaac should never have been given a voice.  What little plot their even is, it doesn't feel like you're motivated by much of anything.  So much so that after the first hour it starts to feel like a slog from ""A-corridor to B corridor.""  Their was a lot of potential here to make a longer, more atmospheric and more interesting game, but they took too many elements they ""thought"" people liked from the first one and focused on them and them only.  Dead Space 2 remains a solid, but ultimately very disappointing sequel at the end of the day.",llamayarmybar

I knew stealth would be too easy, and just fighting through the enemies offers little challenge unless I was playing on a harder mode. However as with most games that try to walk this black and white line of do good/bad I decided to try and be the most stealthy serial killer. Essentially imagine being Ezio from Assassins Creed but having the violent tendencies of Mr. Hyde ripping through enemies and you'd get a general idea. The main game mechanic at play here is the Good vs Evil debate of how you choose to play and for me there was one particular bit that made up my mind. You play Corvo, a man wrongly imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit, very much a wrong place, wrong time cliche, but thats fine. Your first act as Corvo is to break out of prison and this involves getting past all the guards. Its your choice obviously kill/sneak past. Initially I chose kill given that I was to be executed for a crime that I obviously didn't commit, yes unfortunately vengeance was in the forefront of my mind. So I hacked and slashed my way through. This posed very little of a moral quandary until I got to part 2 of the break out; escaping through the sewer. This is where I found one of the many notes you're bound to find spread across Dunwall. In this note a man told a short story of how he and his wife couldn't buy enough elixir to live on and that hopefully the fire they lit would keep the rats at bay. Very sad, I'm sure you'll agree. However what really got me was that when I put the note down and turned to leave there I found huddled together as lovers would these 2 people. I knew the more I killed people the more the disease would spread and I would be subjecting the innocent civilians of Dunwall to a plague that would kill them en mass. However after a quick peek at the achievements I realised that I'd already discounted myself from several of the available challenges and thought to myself ""Screw it, onward and downward in my spiral of death and depravity  but, this couple warrant a 2nd, peaceful playthrough"". In that moment the writers had already convinced me to play peacefully but the real world satisfaction of achievements meant I had to do this twice... So be it.The game does have many fun little minor changes between good and evil choices made by the player. Its a wonderful system that pays off, but maybe you won't realise until you too have played a 2nd more drastically different playthrough. However before I jump into some of the fun facets of the Good v Evil outcomes, one of the things the game does is something that even larger developers with bigger games have done and it never works. At the beginning before you're imprisonment you must meet the Empress and her Daughter Emily. Through reasons that are later explained the Empress is killed and her daughter kidnapped right in front of you and you are left to take the blame. Now I have a problem with this. As a player I'm meant to have some sort of attachment to the Empress and Emily, these 2 women I hardly know and they instantly go and kill one and remove another. Why should I care? I don't know these people, I haven't had time to build an actual immersive relationship with these people enough to care that they're gone. It comes across as more of a ""...Oh, tough  scenario not a ""Oh my god NO!"" moment that the writers clearly want me to have (fallout 3 did this with the Users Dad). Its unfortunate that writers keep seeming to think that I'll care if someone I don't know but am supposed to, dies. It just brings me out of the experience. However you do build an emotional bond to Emily through the game later as you see her change with what's gone on, but the fact that I'm punished so unfairly is a better emotional hot poker in order to get me taking action.So the repercussions of Good vs Evil are one of my favourite tiny mechanics at work here. For instance if you kill everyone you come across when you do talk to Emily later in the game she's far more dark and emo, at one point she draws a picture and on an Evil playthrough you see something that I'd imagine Damien the Devil Child would create, however on a Good playthrough Emily draws sweet child crap like Rainbows (Don't think any of the writers stretched their imaginations there, but still its a nice touch). Also part of the Game involves your use of magical mystic powers given to you by some spectral being called simply ""The Outsider"" (which does sound like a nickname given to the weird kid at school with a snot bubble). On a Good playthrough he appears as he did the very first time you saw him, however after slaughtering your way through Dunwall for the 5th time he appears more darkened and a scarier being overall which is probably the most appropriate thing.See my full review at willza99.wordpress.com, thanks for reading",willza99

From the start, the player can experiment with the combat system, as well as Raiden's ability to slice up a lot of his surrounding environment. As you progress through the game, you can upgrade and customize your skills and stats to create a weapon loadout of your choice, each boss weapon you earn having its own strengths and weaknesses. The soundtrack is incredibly fitting, with boss battles getting iconic and unique theme songs that finish up with their own climatic and bombastic endings. The story does not take itself too seriously, providing a lot of comedy while not being afraid to switch to a more serious tone when needed.Metal Gear Rising is however not without its flaws though, as the controls and parry system can be confusing and difficult to pick up, some of these harder parts of combat which become extremely needed in the later parts of the game, or if you want to go for the no-hit run through the game. A lot of content feels unnecessary as well, with VR missions being generally very difficult and the DLC changing most of the gameplay in more lackluster ways that take away from what the game had been doing well. (I'm looking at you Bladewolf DLC with your stealth execution gameplay).

The ending is lackluster, incomplete and basically set up to sell you, the customer, more DLC's and expansions that will inevitably finish the story- Huge let down with character development - after Bioware spends so much time connecting you to your side characters, everything is just left ""hanging"" at the end of the game- Battle system significantly dumbed down- No customization for other character's armour, limited weapon customization- Glitchy, Buggy quests ruin the game in some spots (crucial quest points with Merill are still bugged at time of writing)- The script is extremely corny in some places, making things absolutely cringe-worthy in many many parts of the game- EXTREMELY limited environments. Dungeons are recycled over and over again, by the end of Act 1, you've probably seen every environment that can be offered to you. This ruins the game environment in many places when you think to yourself ""Wait... haven't I been here before?""- Non-cohesive storyline in many cases, quests do not seem connected- Choices don't really affect your ending, contrary to many other Bioware gamesTl; Dr?

52747,Mass Effect 3,Xbox360,4,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Bottom line: Bioware and EA has pulled it off brilliantly to mess up the whole series with the final instalment of the ME trilogy. A highly disappointing conclusion to the trilogy, which in many ways goes against the essential principles, which made ME1 and ME2 such good games.ME1 and ME2 were, in spite of their flaws, for me a brilliant game-play experience. Although the two first games suffer a bit from too many illusional choices, which actually do not influence the development of story, it never felt as a problem for me, and at least some of the critical choices made would have a very real impact on how the game progressed. This is however completely different in ME3, where virtually all choices made throughout the game, including the meticulous build-up of a joint strike force, in the end proves to be without any kind of significance. Furthermore the relations built up throughout three games to the Normandy crew as well as other friends, is in the end completely pointless, as there will be no reward for the 100+ hours of game-play and decision making throughout the three games. To make matters worse, no amount of DLC content will ever be able to salvage the story and correct the horrible story writing. In terms of game-play mechanics ME3 otherwise feels very polished and refined in many aspects, compared to its predecessors. Many missions and fights are likewise quite memorable. Unfortunately this is seriously messed up near the end of the game, where several combat situations have been very poorly designed. It is namely the introduction of survival mode combat sequences, which seriously messes up the experience. Waves of enemies charges in, and your combat skill will essentially mean very little as to how well these sequences are completed. Stay alive for XX minutes or fail is the essence â",deadmeat2k

The rest of us just laugh and play the truly engaging political narratives, like MGS Twin Snakes and Killer7. Human Revolution really didn't offer much that better games hadn't already done much better, but even without being compared to the competition I found HR to be extremely underwhelming, with far too much exposition that never really led anywhere interesting.I'm sad to say that Mankind Divided has failed to deliver once more, and actually takes several steps back in some ways, particularly where the stealth is involved. In HR, you could feel that the devs tried really hard to make the stealth rewarding and fun, even if it didn't quite work, but MK decided to take the Dead Space 3 approach and throw out everything that could have made the game fun and take a more action oriented approach. It's extremely disappointing to see the devs distance themselves from the one thing I found moderately enjoyable from the last game.I haven't thought about Human Revolution's story since I played the game back when it came out for the best console released this generation, the Wii U, but the fact that I can't recall anything that happened in that game really speaks to it's quality as a narrative. It simply doesn't have interesting protagonists or ideas. And mind you, I personally love the idea of making corporate espionage into an interesting game narrative, but HR failed to deliver any sort of interesting, memorable characters or moments. So I'm sad to say I'm not sure if i would describe MD as 'worse' when I can barely remember what happened in the first game. Again, it's nothing all that interesting, but it's not downright offensive like an AC game or Other M.Mankind Divided is nothing more than just another lackluster release for thirsty fans to pretend that the PS4 is still getting games, when clearly the focus is on the NEO in the foreseeable future.",CodyCoyote64

I run out of health, energy, or even ammo and there she is tossing me some more.  I can't put my finger on it, but I found myself rushing through the last half to get done with it.  Things felt bland after awhile.Environment:  If this is your first time playing BioShock, good for you.  The floating city was quite amazing.  If you have played, you may find yourself a bit let down.  At no time did I feel dread or fear of something lurking like I did the first two.  A bit too happy to the eyes, perhaps?Length:  A good ten to fifteen hour game, depending on your play style.Story:  Alas, the world of BioShock for some reason always must throw the twist at us.  Fun, but I kept feeling I was watching a combination of shows and books I've seen or read recently.  Maybe too many directions you could go with this kind of storytelling, but I was happy it was over when it was.  Felt a bit rushed at the end.

The map is detailed and true to life map of Gettysburg PA. The whole game consists of this one battle which covers four days. If you have ever read in depth about Gettysburg or the civil war you will immediately recognize all you commanders as they are the real commanders from the battle. The objectives you need to capture are the real strategic points from the actual battle.The game play is pretty simple, click a group of soldiers and tell them where to go by dragging a path on the map. Tell them to charge, run, hold, or regular attack. There are four stats to consider with every with every group; cover, morale, reload, and condition. There is also artillery with a few commands of their own (canister, shell). There is also cavalry, skirmishers and commanders. The commanders provide a morale boost to troops close to them. I just pretty much described every mechanic available, but within this framework is a polished and in-depth strategy game that is a lot of fun. The ai is fully adjustable with 9 different settings, and there is multilayer head to head.In my opinion this is one of the best, if not the best civil war strategy game on the market. The re-playability is there if you want to try it from both sides, and then start to adjust the challenge with the ai. I recommend this game to anyone who is new to the genre, likes the civil war or wants to play a really fun game that is not that taxing. Unlike a lot of strategy games it does not take hours to learn. You pretty much know how to play right from the start. The trick is getting good.

In this world the remnants of humanity, having lost access to technology and knowledge from times past, have re-organised themselves into various tribes. The player's mission is to discover what happened in the distant past, gain the acceptance of their people, and ultimately save the world from the robots and their masters.Just like other open world games, there are many things to do and collectables to pick up. Complete main missions and side quests, explore dungeons, climb towers, clear bandit camps, perform errands, collect audio logs, pick up flowers, craft arrows and potions, you name it. However, all these are part of a cohesive experience and whatever you may do at any given time, you will rarely get bored or have a sense of fatigue (which is a problem with many other open world games).Despite the heavy gameplay borrows from other games, Horizon's world, lore, storytelling and main characters are original, if not quite spectacular and memorable as, say, The Last of Us. Other than Aloy, only a few other human characters are developed well enough. The various machines however are mostly excellent and very well-animated, ranging from the little Watchers and Scrappers, to the mid-sized Ravagers and Longlegs, to the fearsome Thunderjaws and Deathbringers. Fighting the robots is pretty challenging (although it's not Souls-like difficult) and thanks to the robust combat system and all the tools at your disposal (weapons, traps, potions) you can beat them quite easily after you learn how to fight effectively. The game's story is clearly built around the concept of fighting robotic dinosaurs in a post-apocalyptic world and not the other way around, so (even though the developers have tried their best to come up with something great) it lacks the magic and punch of other successful story-driven game series such as Uncharted, The Witcher, Final Fantasy, Mass Effect, Metal Gear or The Last of Us.Horizon: Zero Dawn is the most beautiful game currently available on PS4, easily surpassing Uncharted 4. The game's world is so pleasing to the eye that I don't mind walking from mission to mission instead of mounting a machine or fast traveling (which of course I do if I have to go a really long distance). Aloy's voice acting is great and the music is subtle but fitting.My only gripes with the game are these. 1st, having to pick up flowers from the world can become a bit frustrating, because you need to pick up a lot of them, and this can affect the game's pace. 2nd, the AI is somewhat inconsistent, with human enemies feeling less intelligent and competent than the machines. For the record, I am playing on the Hard difficulty setting, and I have played the game through to its very end. 3rd, most of the characters other than Aloy and Sylens are bland and uninteresting.All in all, Horizon: Zero Dawn is a great game and a joy to play through. It's easily one of the best PS4 games out there. It's gonna receive a DLC expansion soon enough named The Frozen Wilds, and I hope that the post-credits scene means it will get a proper sequel at some point.",HTGamer

The last several Tomb Raider games were universally panned by critics but this game really reminds me a lot of a Tomb Raider game and the same critics are giving it universal acclaim.  Here is how I see it: the developers threw in parts of Tomb Raider (puzzle solving/concept), Gears of War (with the duck and cover shooting tactics). Prince of Persia for the platforming, Batman for the melee (counter punches).  The result is a very polished finished product, but I feel like I have been there and done that before.  The computer AI is pretty silly from time to time and there are certain points of the game where you will be confronted by wave after wave of regenerating enemies until you hit a predetermined checkpoint. I am at the ship portion of the campaign right now so I can't say that I have seen the entire game, but based on what I have played it's not a groundbreaking experience.  As of yet I have not tried the online content.  I was a huge fan of the previous games in the series and I had extremely high expectations.

By dedicated machine I mean dedicated: no Anti virus: no video ripping: NO ITUNES. so don't go downloading porn.when you have the RIGHT machine this game has ASTOUNDING GRAPHICS .. full stop-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------I own all the call of duty games in the series for PC. Played them til my eyes crossed at times. The single player game was fantastic challenging without being too frustrating, astounding plot, phenomenal graphics, compelling characters. It felt like a six and a half hour interactive movie. Single player campaign was miles above MW2 in my opinion, and I thought MW2 could not be topped. The Multi-player has a very WAW fell with modern weapons even some that did not exist in the time frame of this game setting, but I'm glad they stretched reality there it makes for a better experience. Updated but not revolutionary is the best way to describe multi-player. The co-op portion was very disappointing, I like the zombies don't get me wrong but I wanted the co-op experience similar to MW2. Not to mention just endless waves of zombies gets old quick. The co-op in MW2 had hours of excitement for me and my friends. We had to function like a small Spec-ops team to complete the maps. You needed: communication, precision, and teamwork to do the missions. Not like Multi-player where no matter what organization an communication you try to establish everyone runs around and does there own thing. There is a ""Combat Training"" mode you can play privately with your friends, but event the AI runs around like decapitated chickens. If they offered non-zombie co-op maps in the future maybe ill buy them (maybe) or hold my breath waiting for it to return next year. Overall a great game. I'm glad to see the franchise grow and improve. It would be a perfect 10 but multi-player did not blow me away like COD4 & COD6, and no good co-op which makes the game playable again and again.â",dexitron

It's pretty evident that alot of passion and difficult choices went into developing this game.I will try to write this review as short as possible.My short opinion: I really enjoyed this game. My enjoyment score would be a 10. However, as you can see, I didn't give it a 10, since a reviewer needs to be as objective as possible(even though this review will contain a lot of subjectivity).The story was entertaining. The way it was presented was interesting as well(no cuts). My only small problem was the pacing. The pacing felt off during certain moments. I don't want to spoil anything about the story and it is just me being nit picky since it isn't a consistent problem.Kratos is also a lot more interesting compared to the previous installments. He isn't one dimensional and you can see him grow as a character as the story progresses. Atreus isn't annoying as well and IMO compliments well with this ""new"" Kratos. Every other characters are interesting and are not ""boring"".Level design is just excellent. The levels are linear, but it has different ""branches"" to explore. Those branches looks interesting and are well thought out. The levels itself looks beautiful. I've played the game on challenge mode without HUD on a FAT PS4 and it is in my opinion the best looking game this generation for the PS4.Sound is like most games good. The music depends on preferences. Voice acting is well done as well. It's on par with other story driven games.Game mechanics:- Combat is well done and has actual depth now. It isn't ""button mashy"". You also have another option to approach the enemies. Instead of depleting their health, you can try to increase their stagger bar to ""one shot"" them with an execution move which is as satisfying as the previous installments. The rage mode also feels more satisfying(a tleast to me).My only problem is that I do miss the jump button. This may however only be a problem for the fans who has played the previous installments.It also has more RPG elements. Instead of just upgrading your weapons like the previous games, it also gives you the option to customize it(aka making it more personal). Kratos and Atreus can also wear ""armors"" and they are customizable as well.Puzzles are also nice and not too difficult. It doesn't take too long to figure out a puzzle, yet it feels satisfying when you solve it. This however may depend on the players and how ""experience"" you are with puzzles in general.The perspective of the camera depends on preferences. I've heard people not liking it, but also people having no problem with the camera angle. From my experience, I had no problem as well and prefer this camera because it's more ""personal"". But again, it depends on your preference.Performance is most of the time consistent. I only had like 3 times of small frame drops.",MrRater

Based on artistic value it's great (probably, I don't art well). But  I don't play games for their art merits. I play for gameplay immersion, mechanics, and story. I saw the pretty pictures, moved the character around, and was given the philosophical message. Didn't care one bit about the traveler or her journey.

Unfortunately, it also left out a lot of the elements that made Wrath of the White Witch so good, such as collecting and taming familiars. The combat is also far less strategic and more of a hack and slash. The story was goodNi no Kuni 2 adds a lot of great new gameplay mechanics. The Kingdom building has a surprising amount of depth and ties into almost all other aspects of the game. Unfortunately, it also left out a lot of the elements that made Wrath of the White Witch so good, such as collecting and taming familiars. The combat is also far less strategic and more of a hack and slash. The story was good enough to keep me engaged but it lacked a lot of the nuance that made the first game great. Overall I really like this game. I think people who liked the first will also like this one and it offers something new but I don't think it is on the same level as the first in terms of story, characters, and combat.Gameplay 8 -  The thing I liked most about the gameplay is that it has a lot of variety, it is a mix between RPG, strategy, and city building but what makes it unique  is how all of those elements compliment each other.  Upgrading your Kingdom allows you to upgrade your weapons and magic in combat. Finding new citizens through side quests allows you to grow your population, upgrade your buildings and technology. Certain characters you find improve your military and give your army advantages in skirmishes. Dungeon crawling and questing can grant you new items that can be used to win over new citizens for your city. It all works fairly seamlessly together to make an addictive experience. On the downside, a lot of the side quests are just basic fetch quests. There is usually a bit of story involved but many of the quests felt like more of a chore than a fun immersive experience. Combat is also quite shallow. There are some cool spells but I found most of the time I ended the battle before even getting to use my more impressive abilities. There were a good number of boss battles but almost all of them  were quite easy. The enemies look better in this game than in Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch but there is much less variety. Since enemy monsters can't be tamed like in the first game it made combat far less interesting and there was less motivation to engage. The menu system is good but not as good as the Wizards Companion in the first game.Story 7 - The story is enjoyable enough, it has a lot of similarities to the first game while still having its own identity but it is more simplistic and has far less lore and depth. There are a few twists and turns but I found it fairly predictable. It kept me engaged but never really amazed me. I did appreciate that almost everything is well explained though and it does a good job of justifying how the world works even if it is fairly simple.World 8 - While I didn't like the world as much in this game as Wrath of the White Witch, it was still full of many interesting locations. Every area that you visit has something new to offer and all of the major cities in the game are totally different in terms of their design and culture. There are quite a few different dungeons to conquer and while there is a lot of repetition there is also a lot of variety. There aren't quite as many puzzle sections as I would have liked but enough to keep things interesting and fresh throughout the whole experience. The over world seemed a bit sparse but just like in the first games there are some really cool ideas both in terms of visual world building and lore.Characters 6 -  The game gets points for having a huge cast and each character that you recruit for your Kingdom has a little story. Considering that there are over 100 that is very impressive. Unfortunately I just found that almost none of them really evolved.  You learn almost everything you need to know about each character within minutes of meeting them. For an RPG of this scale I would have liked to see more depth and meaningful character development especially in the main cast members. Evan went through far less development than Oliver did in the first game. Roland's story starts out very intriguing but it failed to really build on that intrigue. Batu and Tani are kind of generic side kick characters who never really grow or have meaningful interactions with Evan. The main villain of the story is also far less interesting than the villains from the first game. I didn't really find any of the characters compelling.Visual Design 8 - The game looks very good for the most part. The anime style looks great in cities and dungeons. The character designs are simple yet appealing and the menus look good. There are some really good monster designs, although it would have been nice if there were more. The weakest part of the game visually is the over world and skirmishes. For some reason they decided to go with a different style for the over world in this game and I think it looks much worse. The big headed characters just look silly and I don't know why they chose to change styles because the first game over world looked better.Sound 8 - The music is great and voice acting was pretty good.",artificeprime

The leel design is absolutely inspirational as most of your time will be spent repeating your previous missions instead of progressing with the game to even greater levels. Each level is extremely immersive and equally challenging. The AI, personally is unmatchable. I believe it is far beyond Far Cry as instead of complex programmed AI, the game uses a unpredictable innovative set of enemies which means you get a different experience each time you replay the game. The multiplayer is truely unbeatable as it is so vastly customisable so that you can have a simple heated deathmatch like Quake to a frantic assualt like Battlefield to a One life last man standing like Counter Strike to a tactical Co-Op without ever downloading a mod! Speaking of mods, they're is also a great selection which are extremely easy to install. The expansion packs are like parralel games but perhaps not with the equal experience. The only thing that brings the game down is the awful draw distance. This can ruin sniping a little and multiplayer as well. My conclusion anyway is that th new Advanced Warfighter was a step backwards from the original which is quite a pity as this Ghost Recon is truely original, has a simple innovative control system while been a game that anybody can be good at if they have any gene to persevere!My favourite game in my huge collection by far!",AnonymousMC

It's strange too, because Dishonored is exactly what cynical gamers wanted, but apparently even that is not good enough, so let them drown in their own sea of irony they created themselves by crying about how games are awful now compared to retro or older games. Moronic retro hippies, gosh darn it! I bet if this was a sidescroller pixel game, they'd think it was amazing. Idiots.Alright, now I got that off of my chest, let's talk Dishonored. I had this game for awhile already, but it earns some of my highest accolades for being the only stealth game I enjoy immensely. I don't like stealth games, for the most part, but this somehow reeled me in. First, I was immediately drawn in by the beautifully rendered setting. A dark sort of steampunk setting where instead of steam as a powersource, it's whale oil. Within this setting, you have absolute freedom to choose where you want to go, and when. There are hidden items everywhere in these places, and loot lovers like me eat that right up! However, it is mostly in a controlled, smaller environment that never feels too linear. Each mission within these areas can be completed in any way you want as you have so many awesome abilities, equipment, and accessories to help you with them. The combat is annoying and honestly far too difficult, even with my favorite spell, Slow Time, but you have that choice! I just hope you find a better way to deal with foes if you want to go on a murder spree. Otherwise, prepare for annoying cheapshots every second during combat!Also, your choices do matter in these environments. It makes you think hard about killing, and whether or not it is the right thing to do. You can change the course of the game by these decisions, with some choices causing more of the zombies called ""Weepers"" to appear in later areas, or security to greatly tighten in other areas. Each area, by the way, being a mission. But even then, you can take a break from the tough decision making and go on plenty of side missions, which is an awesome bonus! You can even spend your hard earned money on upgrades, which is also great as well. I am a fan of that kind of game mechanic!Anyways, Dishonored, as well as all of its DLC, is amazing.

196093,DmC: Devil May Cry,PC,3,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        60 FPS, increased resolution and textures don't make up for all the shortcomings of this game.I want to start saying that DmC was my first Devil May Cry game, and I found it decent at first. However, the more I played, the more repetitive and nonsensical the game became.Platforming is a chore. Air dash here, grapple this and that. Combat consists of spamming Aquilas and the Axe, along with Demon Evade. There is literally no incentive to vary your combos, since the style meter is driven by damage and not combo variety.Another thing that bothered me was that I played on Hard (Nephilim) but it felt like I was playing on easy. Enemies simply stand there waiting for you to whack them. Don't get me started on the bosses; they were simply horribly designed, boring and way too easy. Mundus is a joke and Vergil is simply a terrible final boss. Whole game feels rushed, too.The dialogue was bad. Dante can't deliver one liners and instead relies on cheap insults to compensate. The story is stupid and there are parts that simply don't make sense or even try to be relevant. Characterization is almost nonexistant, and the plot twist is predictable from miles away.Combat is weak. There are too little upgrades and moves, along with few potential for variation. Your weapons are overpowered and you'll find yourself spamming an attack to win in most cases. The game also likes to take control off your hands a lot with cutscenes in the middle of battle. That is unforgivable on this genre.The music is horrible and does not fit at all. Animations are decent, but only on Dante. Bosses suffer due to this. (see vergil, his animations are trash.)The game also has a lot of bugs with collision, which is why  I'm not sure if this was properly beta-tested. There is also a major bug on the final Boss.One point the game gets is the ambientation. Dynamic scenario mutation looks great, and some levels are very creative, like the club one and the one about the media. Nice color palettes.With all of this in mind, I decided to give the originals a spin and god damn, they're much, much better. Don't waste your time with this trash and go play DMC 1, 3 and 4. Much deeper mechanics and more finely-crafted in general.  DmC Gets a 3/10 from me for all its flaws and shortcomings.",SwoopTrust

It is up to you to find out by picking up key elements of objects and find the story behind it. The atmosphere in the game is very dark and scary in somewhat areas of the house.I still do not know what the People that made the game of the game want us to think, but in my opinion, I think that the People that made the game want us to tell that anyone can turn out to be like her sister. I am not going to spoil anything for you so I would not say anything in deep detail about that subject.The game has one timeline, but the game has a sort of a ‘flashback’ so the story about a particular object that the main character have. Then occasionally you will hear her telling her story.The game has some religious symbols like bible and other Christian symbols, but there will be many Satanist symbols here and there, and a weedgee board and other such stuff.The main character talks many different conflicts they had in school and what the family thinks about gay folks. Supposedly because the family is very Christian.The character is very important since she’ll ramble much about the different history and how they were when they was kids and all other histories.The game is an adventure horror kind of a game because of the dark turns about religion and what not while you are roaming the house to find all the bits and pieces.The photos showed how the family and the other members of the game looks like and the music tells us what kind of a person the different characters are. By listening to the songs Samantha likes to listen too, got me thinking that she is definitely not a Christian.The game was an fps type horror adventure game.My opinion on the game is, I didn’t like the game at all sadly. Why? Because it got very repetitive when I had to pick up and throw millions of objects, trying to find an object that starts her to tell me a story. Nevertheless, in the end of all picking and throwing objects, I did not care what story she’ll tell. It might be just be I, don’t forget that it is just my opinion.

In the latter portions you end up doing a *lot* of back and forth over familiar terrain either grinding monsters or fetching quest items.

The gun play in this game is vastly improved from what Naughty Dog has done before and although sometimes the AI will prove me wrong the AI is much more intelligent. But most importantly killing the AI in this game is more meaningful as you feel like you're protecting Ellie and will do whatever it takes to get her through this world safely.As a final note I would suggest you play through this without caring for trophies as you will not get the bulk of them until the end of your third play through. I understand the appeal of trophies as I wear my platinum's for all of Naughty Dog's games with pride. But after finishing the game on hard you will only have 8% of the trophies. Good luck and have fun! ",Chiyou

The game is probably from a more pragmatic and non-biased standpoint more like an 8 out of 10 (Great Game) for everything it does well, and at WORST a 6/10 (Slightly above Average) bogged down by a bit of repetition but held up by some excellent facial animations and acting (not just voice-acting, but real ACTING). But all in all it is still probably one of my favorite games personally, and is a required MUST-BUY for all gamers unless all you like is pulse-pounding action (which is not always a bad thing).

The pace is weird. The flow is terrible. It's slow and messed up. Maybe it's the inability to be able to queue production. Maybe it's the fact that you have to constantly interrupt your production to make workers for your neighboring low production cities because they only last a limited number of improvements. Maybe it's the fact that you have to build districts before you start reaping benefits and feel some sense of progress. Maybe it's the terrible housing system.I hate the housing system that stunts your population growth. You don't get 1 citizen per tile anymore, no. You start with between 1 to 3 housing capacity depending on conditions and get 0.5 housing per SOME tile improvements (not mines), then SOME buildings will give you few additional housing. Housing is SCARCE in early game. When your number of citizens reaches your housing limit minus 1, the growth rate is reduced. Good luck if you have land with little production, because it then becomes a vicious circle of production deficiency : You need population for more production and you need more production to build housing units to get more population. If you start in a tundra or a desert, you might as well start over.Districts aren't a well executed idea. The concept causes great balance problems. All the buildings you could build in previous games that would allow you to make up for low food and low production environments are gated behind... *drumroll*... population (which is gated by food and housing) and production! Building districts at an acceptable rate requires production, which requires population, which requires food and housing, which requires production. And then, as if that wasn't enough, districts are gated behind population minimums. Tundra and desert tiles are very hard to play for that reason. Other than the ONE trade route you can get in early game to get more food and production from another of your cities (which is a very bad thing to depend on for food), I really don't know what to do about that. Nothing in the policies helps with that either. Oh... and you can't build farms on tundra and hills next to freshwater anymore.Great people are given out like candy.Civics are weird, annoying and a little too much to think of for very little reward ; The bonuses are plenty in numbers, but they don't really feel significant or relevant. Everyone is going to have access to the same ones and progress roughly the same way. There is no specialization. There is little punishment if you don't plan ahead, don't think things through or make mistakes. You are forced to research civics that you do not want or need, as prerequisites to others that you might want. Being prompted to look at them and switch them every time you are done researching one (often) is annoying. I liked Civ V's way of doing it better. The buffs were fewer and more significant within the game balance and the choice you made really mattered.Eventually, you realize that civilizations have been at war and you were not notified. Well you were, among the 3 messages that last 5 seconds that pop on your screen at the beginning of a turn then disappear. AND THERE ARE NO LOGS for these things. If you miss it, it's gone. Forever.There is no diplomacy overview that I could find. You have to check each civ for its relations with others. THERE IS NO OVERVIEW TO SEE EACH CIV'S RESOURCES & WONDERS.The UI is a mess and all over the place.There is no indication of how long until border expansion, nor which tile the city is going for.The fog of war and unlit terrain are way too much alike. It is way too difficult to see resources on unlit terrain.Friendly civs can have units in each other's territory without open border which makes moving your units around even more tedious and can block your workers from making improvements. This is BS.There seems to be no way to tell a civ to piss off with their religion so be prepared to protect your cities with units. There is a new system with religious units that can attack each other... like normal wars weren't enough and we needed even more warring BS in this game.BORING. 3rd game trying to have fun.

Therein lies the beauty of this game; you can play it as you see fit. In fact my girlfriend is playing this game in a sims like manner, buying houses, decorating them, buying clothes, changing her apperance, getting married, having kids and accumalting a nice little fortune. All of the above mentioned is a small part in wonderfully diverse game. The overall atmosphere of the game is great, from the voice acting to the presentation of the cities and the landscape. Walking around bowerstone market is much like walking around a real-life market, you hear the cries of ""sales"", the gossiping between the ladies, the men and woman at their respective stores or stands pushing for sales; all of this is truly immersive and of course if you are well liked you will have followers or at least you will be greeted as walk from place to another. Obviously there are all the normal rpg elements such as levelling up, increasing the potency of weapons etc. Of course there is the main storyline to follow which I believe is quite an epic tale. There are so many variables in this game such as the way your apperance changes depending on your actions, either good or evil, corrupt or pure; you can also become fat which is defendant on the food you eat, there really is just so much to the game. All in all this a fantastic immeresive experience and as mentioned one in which you can play as you see fit.....bottom line; you cannot really ask more from an RPG. Well Done PM!!",Gregg

However, the world just doesn't feel the same as the first fable, maybe because it is 500 years down the track but I think that's not the main reason. Combat is extremely satisfying, however after a short while, every battle just seems to be a pointless struggle for experience, which you don't need. It isn't challenging enough while trying to kill the mobs and even the boss' are a blow over. It's a game that gives the player endless opportunities to do many different things, however too many of these things are optional, some only offering an emotional reward, 'love', Maybe Fable 3 will be different, I just hope that it isn't again, 500 years down the track maybe push it back 1000 years, that would be interesting.",JackC.

Just don't. In Hs there is no such thing like matching opponent of similar game count, which means that right from begining you may be spared against enemy with 30x times more games played and thus over 30x times more cards - i can tell via my own experience when as i had about 120 games won i have played against dude with rank 7 and over 4k won games. Another thing - cards cards, cards. You think you will get what you want/need? Think twice. You won't. after year of playing i am still using decks of my own creations which are ""outside of meta"" making me win 2-3 games out of 10 played. Is losing bad? Normally i pay no attention if i am winning or losing... but here comes HS punishes. If you don't win - you get no gold. There is absolutely no reward for losing a game no matter how hard and mental exhusting it woult me. now, what can be bought bu gold - card packs and arena entrances. To get a card pack you have to win 30 times. yes 30. Each game can easily take 10 min or even more. Now, recall me saying that i win 2-3 game out of 10. Yes, collecting 100 gold sometimes takes me from dawn till dusk.Another thing - i said that new card expansions makes game less repetetive. In the end, it doesn't.

I dind't, and here i am. almost crying with each game being played as i stuggle to collect 150 games to play on arena - the only, lemme reapet - ONLY fun thing in HS, which is making deck of random cards and fighting against another oponent with random cards - so you can be sure that you will never use same cards and play against same kind deck twice.So, summarizing, HS is a GREAT GAME with wonderful system, nicely made rng, bah! even a lore and advnture system... but it is a shut ""society"" if you would join it now, prepare on devastation and completely lack of support for new players.I highly disrecommend starting playing this game for anyone that is not a masochist, for i have no idea why i keep playing this game and keep wondering over quiting playing this game for good. I think that i will just wait till next expansion and see, if thing would get at least little less ""unplayable""",Anuel

So this review can be considered a review of the reviews rather than a review of the game.I wonder if people actually understand what a review is, it's not where you show whether you liked the game or not, if so then I think a basic system of thumbs up thumbs down would work better, but it's not such a system unfortunately. I'm going to be commenting on both the high and low ratings in order to seem as unbiased as possible.I understand that it may be hard to rightfully judge a game considering how ratings actually work nowadays, a 7 of 10 is considered mediocre, 4 of 10 is considered bad, and so forth. Though it should be common sense that very few games are worthy of 10s, and even fewer are worthy of 0s.A score of 10 would mean that the game has absolutely no flaws or issues, or an extremely small amount of them. 10 would mean that the game is as perfect as it can be, this game does have issues, that's clear to see. Mainly concerning PC optimization, framerate drops and controls and such are problematic. Giving a 10 is not good, it won't give the developers any reason to improve on future games, for this reason, giving a 0 is actually better.Giving a score of 0 is a different story however, I can think of very few games that actually deserve 0, the one that comes to mind is Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, which was an unfinished game that had barely entered alpha stage. Even games such as Ride to Hell deserve at least a 1 for the effort, but that's just my opinion so take that for granted. 0 Would mean that the game has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and every single feature of the game is flawed.The users that give the game a 10 are only mentioning the things they love about the game, ignoring the issues completely, same with users who give it 0 who only focus on the flaws. I've seen a few reviews that start with sentences such as ""I'm only 10 hours in and I'm already bored"" and given it a 0, if the game was actually worth a 0 then you most likely wouldn't have been able to play for 10 hours.Most reviews that give a 10 or 0 have a simulated sense of reliability because the score matches up with what the review actually says. A review that enthusiastically talks about how perfect the game without mentioning any flaw will obviously sound reliable to the reader, because it has no flaws at all it's deserving of a 10 right? And vice versa.Then there are opinions of course, I can't affect your opinions, though hopefully I've gotten through to at least a few of youTL;DR: This has become a war between fanboys and haters, with the fanboys coming out slightly on top. Giving the game a 10 or 0 because you slightly like or dislike it completely defeats the purpose of a review in the first place, it's pretty **** ridiculous and pathetic. Those of you who actually give honest reviews with honest scores, I applaud you.",whatevah12

BF3 has taken a major down turn in this area . the story mode pretty much just sucks . you pretty much just live through flash backs of the main character as he tells his story to two guys .the story mode almost feels like its trying to be more like COD MW ... dull , boring and void of fun . the bright spot is the online mode . if you liked BF1 and 2 online you will have no problem getting into BF3 . its a very team based . the maps are huge and look great and are alot of fun . people like to complain this is such a massive Camping game . well its focus is on realism , sorry to disappoint you but the military soldiers dont run out all over the place and shoot like a bunch of morons . if you want to run around like a chicken with your head cut off shooting every thing that moves go play COD. down sides of the online would be that when you first start the game you feel way under powered compared to higher level players . which feels like BS and probubly wouldnt be a major issue if you didnt level up so damn slow. over all though the online is alot of fun .",ArkonBlade

There's likely hundreds of fans that have bought plane tickets, hotel tickets, and TI tickets to be able to meet Fnatic members and cheer their team on.

Two, I can't fully describe the feeling I get when my imaginary characters pick up a digital weapon that just fits their build. Love it. While there are annoying bits of tedium in the loot system and thus character progression (as well as the wish I had of finding gloves of teleportation with better armor stats...) any flaws aren't enough to impede one's enjoyment. Three, the atmosphere/graphics. The original already had impressive enough environments and design but this one just amps it up a bit. I also find myself not being as stumped as I was in the first one though this could be due to my becoming more familiar with how Larian does things. Four, and finally, combat. Challenging, almost puzzle like in execution, it's frustrating yet bloody brilliant. There are also some world encounters that are flat out hilarious, too. I still have so much left to play (only a bit into Act 2)...but I've thoroughly enjoyed cheesing and making my way through this world.One final note, and others have noted this as well, but Larian as developers are awesome and deserve as much love as we can give them. They put everything into this game and you can tell. People talk about nostalgia & these isometric games, but there's another level to it--I feel like a kid again when I play this game, able to believe there is magic and good in this world. If I could make a video game (or, when I do make a video game of my own)...Larian has provided an excellent model to follow and I hope to one day bring as much love and passion to video games as they do.",cyclopeon

45311,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,PC,10,"I have mixed feelings about this game so I'll start with the worst thing:-the combat controls in this game are absolutely dire.  If you've come from playing a game with a combat system as tightly designed as Bloodborne then playing this will be a shock to the system for you.  I can't believe they managed to make this huge fantastic game and then drop the ball on something as fundamentalI have mixed feelings about this game so I'll start with the worst thing:-the combat controls in this game are absolutely dire.  If you've come from playing a game with a combat system as tightly designed as Bloodborne then playing this will be a shock to the system for you.  I can't believe they managed to make this huge fantastic game and then drop the ball on something as fundamental as the controls.  Geralt is so slow at putting into motion what you've input, you're best off just button-mashing and hoping for the best.  Combine this with the god-awful camera and you have one of the worst-functioning combat systems in recent gaming, so much so that I had to lower the difficulty from the harder setting to the normal setting, not because I was finding it too difficult, but because I wanted to spend less time doing something so unenjoyable.  This, for me, is the single worst aspect of Witcher 3.Other minor niggles:-although the inventory system is very functional, you can't order items by value, weight, etc which I feel would have been a big help-I'm not a big fan off the graphical style of the world... This is more of a personal preference thing but I feel it looks too colourful and cartoony in places.  The dynamic weather is okay but can leave the trees and grasses moving in a weird, rubbery way.-most enemies don't telegraph their attacks very well but there IS a red-indicator that appears before an attack, so this only really becomes a problem when there's multiple enemies on-screen.  This wouldn't be an issue at all if the controls and camera were actually any good.-Geralt can't fall 4 feet without losing a chunk of health, which is annoying and a little jarring considering he's meant to be some sprightly acrobatic Witcher.-uninteresting upgrade/skill tree. Most abilities are a dull '+X% to this stat' affair.  Also, each of these have to be equipped for you to use them, which I found a little silly.  For example, why would Geralt lose the ability to hit 5% harder with his fast attack? O yea, you un-equipped it in the menu.  It just doesn't make much sense from a role-play perspective.-not as free-roaming as you'd think. Most areas and quests are essentially locked to you (because enemies don't level with you) until you level up enough to explore/do them.  Doesn't bother me too much this, but if you're expecting to run off Skyrim-style and do your own thing then think again.-some minor graphical bugs e.g. Pop-in and frame-rate.  Not as big of an issue as some would have you believe tho. Loading times are good.Now for the good:-fantastic sound design... Music is perfect for the world and the voice acting, for the most part, is sublime.  Some people don't like Geralt's voice actor but I think he does a great job.  Sound effects like the weather are also fantastic.-the characters are fully-fleshed out and believable, even the minor characters .  I never skipped the dialogue (which is rare for me), and found myself totally engrossed in what was going on.  You can really see the effort the designers have put into this aspect of the game.  Geralt is a brilliantly realised protagonist and the voice-actor delivers all his subtleties perfectly (like his sense of humour).-the narrative in general is excellent-I absolutely love the quest design... You won't find many boring 'fetch quests' here and when you do find any, there's always more too them weather it be an interesting story to uncover or an intriguing location to explore or a tough enemy to fight.  I've poured hours into following whole quest lines that have nothing to do with the main story.  There's plenty of 'moral-grey areas' you find yourself in when doing a favour for someone and you uncover some hidden truths.  More often than not, things are not as they seem and you feel like there is a real consequence that results from the choices you make.-preparing yourself for fights by reading up in the bestiary and preparing the right oils and bombs etc is a really cool, rewarding and immersive aspect of the game.-it's definitely got that addictive 'just one more quest' quality to it-the sheer amount of content is mind-blowing.  I find it incredible that a team of around 200 people put this together with this much attention to detail. Speaking of which...-I really appreciate details like NPC's moving at a pace that matches your own when you're following them.  Also there's nice touches with the menu's e.g when buying from an alchemist you can access your alchemy menu from the shop menu, so you don't have to exit to see what you need. There's a ton of other neat touches, too many to put here.-Gwent, the in-game card-game, is great and the perfect de-stress after you've just been getting pissed off with the God-awful controls.All in all, a fantastic game worth your money... I only give this a 7 because there's just too many flaws that spoil the experience - it loses 2 points on the controls alone.",Bollywongaloid

For the uninitiated, here are the additions:-60 frames per second 1080P graphics.-The whole game has been reworked, with more plot, new characters, enemies shifted across the spectrum of the whole game, and gameplay has been given a major overhaul.-Up to 6 players (online players and NPC's) in a single summoning session.The graphics are lovely and smooth, in fact they are better than the PC version of last year!!  Yes, the game is a year old (and it has aged a little in terms of graphics) but trust me, the enhancements do work and it just looks about the best it can.  The sound has not changed, but it didn't need to and its the same awesome music combined with the breathtaking sound effects that are the norm for FROM soft.In terms of gameplay, to say this is tougher than the first Dark Souls 2 incarnation is perhaps not fair - 'different' is certainly a fairer term.  Enemies haven't been just 'swapped around' to try and mix things up, they've been intelligently placed, meaning that whereas seasoned players cannot be complacent, newcomers will enjoy the experience a great deal too.  Of particular note is the fact that certain events are not easily reachable now and you will have to work for them (but please note, its dealt with fairly).  Coupled with the new strains of the plot, this makes for a very compulsive experience.I've kept this review short as I've reviewed it once and this time I'd like to express the following: this is well-worth the purchase if you enjoyed it first time around as much as I did, or if you feel like a challenge.  The changes effectively null-out the complaints from last time and coupled with the overhaul of presentation and gameplay, make for a severely addictive game.On the PS4, Scholar of the First Sin is arguably the best remaster you can buy currently and more than worth the price of admission (or re-admission).  Buy this as well as Bloodborne, and be prepared to lose yourself!!",bosconian87

I find that nowadays, every trailer is a spoiler.This made my experience all the more enjoyable.The downloadable story of about 3 hours, tells a prologue story of Ellie. Before leaving the quarantine zone. Before Joel. Before the Fireflies.You play as Ellie on the very day that she was bitten, while her and a young friend named Riley explore an abandoned mall.There was a lot more to the story than I could have ever expected, however, that's something that you must see for yourself to truly appreciate.One of the best parts about the new DLC, is the removal of a large part of the combat. One of the things that slightly frustrated me about the first game, was the fact that it seemed like killing people was the only thing allowing me to progress through the level.This time around, it's down to just the narrative to drive the story. There are some of the mechanics that were intended to be used for combat purposes in the original game, that have been reworked in some of the most wonderful ways I could ever have imagined.You also are given quite a bit of freedom to roam around the locations of the game, and there is a great sense of exploration that comes into play.I should comment on the length, and I cannot even express how frustrating it is to see registered critics docking points because it is relatively short. If critics could only see past the function of the game as a distraction and more as the piece of art that it is, they may realize that it is quality over quantity that matters, and always will be.Not to even mention the fact that at around 3 hours (while I was taking my time to explore), I found it even then to be a little drawn out. But spending an extra half an hour with such wonderful characters is hardly a bad thing.Overall, The Last of Us: Left Behind, is a phenomenal addition to one of the greatest games of all time.You should already know if you're interested in returning to the dark, harrowing world of Ellie and Joel, but if you are even slightly on the fence, just know that the $15 spent will not be wasted.A 10.Jack Valentine",JackValentine

130116,Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,PlayStation3,7,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        AC4 is a stark detraction for the series, it takes the Assassins Vs Templars conflict that has all but defined the previous games by heavily intertwining actual historical elements with a clever and innovative if somewhat contrived narrative of greater conflict and throws it out of the window in favour of committing acts of Piracy and watching Blackbeard intimidate random people. Whilst the assassins and Templars are involved, the new protagonist Edward Kenway, is very clear in his objectives. Make money, get drunk and generally be very stereotypically pirate-y. If it didn’t draw such stark similarities to the known mantra of the AC games it could be justified as an entirely separate release.Unfortunately this is where the main problem lies. AC4 seems like a case of going through the motions, endlessly trudging through supposedly intertwining plots that have no relevance to each other and begin to make no sense as Kenway shows up, courtesy of the mission marker, to do something that was never alluded to beforehand and trying to follow his desperate attempts to be pirate like as most if not all consumers expect before running off for no reason to help the assassins because its an assassins creed game and they have to be there. The narrative quickly becomes lost during the two polar opposite behaviours with the only focal point being a contrived pursuit of one obscure target which almost every character tells him to forget about and quite frankly I’m with them. It seems if it wasn’t for Abstergo being so desperate to see what’s inside then there would be no reason for Kenway to even bother. That’s not to say however that the story doesn’t have it moments where occasionally all the contrived nonsense can be forgotten in the face of pure unadulterated joy or the beautiful moment where the well set out missions allow for an incredible flow of play that is endlessly satisfying.This turns out to be the truth of AC4, the real fun is not made by the narrative rather by the player themselves which is no bad thing. Cruising the enormous and visually stunning Caribbean aboard a ship which can be directed to any corner of the map, or indeed anywhere inside the largest map ever seen, to commit acts of piracy that are incredible fun. There are few experiences more satisfying than utilising overwhelming force with a sea-tank loaded to the brim with broadside cannons capable of obliterating the enemy leaving them dead in the water as easy pickings or antagonising a brutally powerful man o war into a delicate dance requiring timing and genuine tactics to overcome. This is followed by a sublime boarding experience which really accentuates what the game seeks to encapsulate, swinging from the rigging to assassinate from above and massacring the individuals aboard until their surrender at which point resources are gained and these feed into a well thought out trade and economy system whereby collecting resources allows the ship to be improved so more piracy gives the potential for better upgrades to facilitate targeting higher ranked ships in a perpetual motion. Similarly the sea forts are enormous fun, obliterating towers and fighting to achieve control whilst the warehouses offer a fun and different challenge using assassin skills to sneakily if possible requisition useful items although thankfully the frustrating ‘do not be detected’ sequences have been dropped in a refreshing update of the series which makes the gameplay far more accessable.However not all of the creases are ironed out, the game too frequently sinks the immersion to davy jones locker by shoehorning in following characters whilst they spout exposition or eavesdropping sections even if there is no point. I literally found myself following a guy through about three guarded settlements only to drop down from a tree and slash his throat in full view of about twenty other soldiers after he talked about being drunk and other such irrelevant drivel.  In an age where computing is so powerful and developed such simple filler seems anachronistic particularly so when the point of its inception is not at its core logical anyway and these blemishes on AC4’s appearances are not the only ones to remain. The navigation is still a bit clunky having Edward sprint up walls, launch himself off buildings or change orientation entirely without any input to suggest that’s what he should be doing with enough frequency it becomes annoying particularly after seamlessly taking out six guards on an immensely fun attack only to throw a smoke bomb to escape their colleagues except when it clears they see you desperately clinging to a roof dangling within sword range like a deranged puppet. The combat also has its problems, the camera does not give a wide enough FOV to parry incoming attacks particularly on ships and suchlike potentially being so close the only solution is to mash counter, some enemies predict what you do before you do it to annoying effect and fighting one enemy who can only be killed by following up an initial counter becomes tiresome when he stands there like an idiot abjectly refusing to attack. Yet the combat ultimately, as is now commonplace, is not that hard and the lack of enemy variety and weapons (Edward can now only wield dual swords) means after a while a certain level of boredom begins to dominate what is arguably one of the best visual melee spectacles in any game series even despite some strange bugs both with targeting and ragdoll animations.The characters who are for their part well played feel fleeting cameos purely there for atmosphere and to drive the story forwards being paper thin representations of exactly what is expected of the era. Whilst they deliver appropriately with Blackbeard being a particular highlight there is no humanity, no individualism which knits the characters together and that feels very much like the mantra of the game. It is incredibly enjoyable on its surface, a commit piracy and murder people in an open world with plenty to do setup that gives you a surface on which to operate. Try to read in to it, to go deeper, to spend time to get to know it remains far from the rewarding experience it should be, I spent hours pursuing short term goals of profit for certain expenditure being rewarded quite happily by the game frequently enough to remain invested yet when I took a step back at three o clock in the morning I felt deflated realising the past twelve hours had been used up on menial tasks with no overarching purpose. The superficial very much dominates here, the game expects you to play it obediently and not to question how its numerous well made parts function together as at that instant it begins to fall apart.That being said these individual parts cannot be understated in terms of how much they can be enjoyed but as a whole the game feels empty. A story going nowhere much like the character. Yet despite all this there is fun to be had if all pretences of logical story or a reason to keep massacring people for next to no reason can be thrown aside and for that reason it isn’t a bad game with enough entertainment to keep you going provided you do so with independent aims in mind rather than expecting the story to rope you in by itself.",AllThingTrivial

Only reason why this game did not get a 10 from me is due to a few minor glitches but most of all, because I live in the UK and the PAL version does not contain the beautiful gory violence the other games have.",abraham_b

I completed all 8 worlds and obtained all 3 star coins on all but a handful of the levels on the first try.  The rest weren't hard to find.  The levels are quite small so finding them wasn't a huge challenge.  The special levels mix it up, and have so far been more difficult to complete 100%.  The Bowser levels are few, but are very exciting, having you run towards the switch at the end a la Super Mario Bros on NES, except in a long, 3D section rather than a short bridge as in that original.There is little replay value here in the short-term (unless you ARE struggling to get 3 star coins everywhere) but I definitely will run through it again probably every year or two, as I do with most other Mario titles.Easily the best Super Mario (platforming) handheld game for sure, and gives many of the home console games a run for their money.",funkydoodycool
38202,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,Xbox360,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        9.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 10).Call of Duty is the definitive videogame cash cow. It is basically the Micheal Bay of gaming. There are plenty of explosions, the budgets are gigantic, they make a tonne of revenue and most importantly, they haven't really innovated in 2 years. Most of these claims can be laid at the feet of the game that started it all: Modern Warfare. In all fairness, I doubt Infinity Ward even thought about the large amount of sequels that could potentially follow this game. After all, everybody thought that a modern shooter wouldn't work- that it would fall apart after so many games spent in WWII. That never happened.The single player campaign of MW popularised the approach to turn FPS narratives into globe trotting linear levels, that go through dozens of set pieces in less than 6 hours. Off course, this is the real negative of the game. The plot can't sustain pace all too well and so you'll have this wrapped up in one really long session. But that doesn't mean it sucks. The bombastic campaign is set piece after set piece, with an epic ship infiltration, a tank driving sequence and a kinetic car chase all making the cut. Of course there is also the iconic ""All Ghillied Up"" Sniper level which sees you sneaking through an abandoned city with one ally and plenty of soldiers after you. It is still the greatest FPS level of all time. The levels aren't open at all with funnelled corridors making for the most interesting environnments, but this linearity suits the game. It has been criticised for this in more recent entries.The story is one of the best in COD history, as a mysterious Russian villain begins to cause widespread havoc, even though the instantly likeable Captain Price thought he had assassinated him years ago. You take the role of John ""Soap"" Mactavish, a new recruit who just wants to prove himself. Multiple twists and turns are taken and the use of multiple roles (even if Soap is the main character), helps to flesh out the story. A particular level uses the first-person perspective in a genuinely disturbing way. The killing of certain characters also helps the player to develop a strong emotional feeling, even if this is the first installment.The game is designed with a high level of replayability in mind. There are multiple difficulty levels and an addictive Arcade mode. In fact, the epilogue level of the game that comes after the credits is probably one of the most replayable levels in gaming history. The campaign is so inviting that you will want to go back and play through it again. The short length is certainly a detractor, but collectibles and achievements certainly add more time to the experience. But enough about single player, because multiplayer is the main attraction of Modern Warfare.The modes are excellent. From Team Deathmatch to Capture the Flag, there is a wide range of variety on offer. This means that investing hours into the mode won't get repetitive like it does in other shooters. The maps are fairly large, but certain ones are designed to be tiny. The close quarters feel is what makes the COD MP so unique and that is firmly established here. The ship map that is ripped from the campaign is a particular campaign, but most of them are instant classics and the DLC helps to increase the amount of environments on offer. It may not be as dynamic as Battlefield, but it certainly is more polished and more approachable. The slick gunplay and easy control scheme are perfectly suited to the game. This is further advanced by the quick use of gadgets and the fast switching- this may seem like a small compliment in these days, but back 7 years ago, it was revolutionary. So was the levelling system and the constant influx of new weapons and gear. It plays out like an RPG online and that is truly an amazing advancement. THe scoresteaks and perks are fairly outlandish in such a grounded setting, but they still work to make this an unpredictable and exhilarating experience.So Modern Warfare is responsible for plenty of annoying things. Short campaign. Check. Lack of open choice and environments. Check. Campers. Check. Twelve-year olds with screechy voices. Check. Yep, this popularised pretty much what everyone hates about the genre. If you look past its damaging legacy and embrace it for what it is, you'll get the third best Call of Duty out, just behind BLOPSII and MW2- but that's my opinion.",EzioA88

Michael, Franklin and Trevor.  The 3 character system is a great idea, and I can see the advantages from a story point of view.Let me start by saying that I have not finished this game yet, I am around a third of the way through the main missions, and completed some additional activities on the side.Grand Theft Auto V is the story of 3 lead characters and their interwoven stories.  Michael, Franklin and Trevor.  The 3 character system is a great idea, and I can see the advantages from a story point of view.  However, I feel that it simply isn't implemented as well as it could be, or as useful as some of the pre-release footage showed.  Any mission I have played to date with multiple characters doesn't let you switch as much as I would like.  Chasing a boat with Franklin and Michael was fun, But when Franklin boarded the boat, I wanted to control him, not follow the chase as Michael.  Later in the same mission, I would have preferred to continue driving, instead of being forced to switch to the shooter.  Maybe that seems like a minor gripe, but the more I have played, the more I see the switching system as an inconvenience.  Missions that can only be completed by specific characters, property that has to be bought by the right character, and separate pools of cash and ammo.The gameplay aside from switching is tight.  Cars control well for the most part, cover and gun play are fun, and the tennis and golf activities play better than some full fledged sports titles I have had the misfortune of playing.  But I still find myself getting bored.  For such an expansive map there are wide areas of nothing.  Mount Chiliad for example. Is massive, it looms large as you approach it, and the mountain base sprawls to cover an area not dissimilar to the area covered by Los Santos itself.  But it is barren.  I have flew over it a number of times, drove past it even more, and have no desire to go anywhere near it.The game is technically very impressive, with no load screens in sight, however, the resulting frame-rate issues occasionally make me wish the game would have stopped for 10 seconds to finish what it was doing before letting me carry on.  Graphically it's competent, it does what it sets out to do, and the explosions are very pretty, but graphics are not this games strongest asset.The characters are, at least most of them.  Most of the characters are well written, well voiced, and have their endearing aspects.  At the same time, there are a handful of characters that have bit parts that you feel should be fleshed out more, perhaps I will see them again later in the game.  However, I had read other reviews, and from what I was expecting, Trevor was supposed to be the favourite for the player, and Chop the dog was supposed to be a great leap in the 'dogs in games' movement that Peter Molyneux seems to have started.But Trevor is just a scumbag, and not the funny kind that he should be, but just a straight out scumbag, his motivations are skewed in such a way that it's hard to empathise with him, when he does some of the things he does, you just wish he would stop.  As far as Chop goes, I was forced to use him in one mission, which was painful to see included in a game of this calibre and haven't looked at him since, which makes the companion app redundant so far.I feel like I am focusing too much on the negatives, but it's only because I had such hope and hype for this title, and 15 hours in, I am only still playing it because I have nothing else taking me away right now.  (So much so that I am taking to writing a review on a site I have never written on before so that I have something else to do for a while)It's a solid game, it has some brilliant moments, but just isn't what I was hoping for, and feels like a step in the wrong direction since GTA IV.  Perhaps the game will prove me wrong by the time I reluctantly finish it.  But right now it feels like there will be more monotony than joy to reach the end game",minus15t

Modern Warfare 3 may not have many changes, but it's still a solid game. Let's start with the single player experience. It continues from when Modern Warfare 2 left off, with Makarov being the bad guy and Price and Soap trying to stop him doing bad stuff. Unfortunately, the single player for the Call of Duty series has really been demoted to a secondary exeprience, Multiplayer being the primary focal point. There's not a lot going on, World War 3 has come to the US, and you have to shoot a lot of Russian clones in the face while explosions happen everywhere. Sound familiar? The story is really like a Michael Bay movie, big and dumb with badass dudes yelling while jets and choppers and tanks make things go boom. I won't spoil anything, but really what happens in the story is gonna be forgotten as soon as you are done with it. It is a really short one too, as it took me just under 5 hours on normal. And you probably won't go back to play through it again unless you want those extra achievments you missed, wanna beat it on Veteran, or get the Intel collectible items. However, while single player falters, the multiplayer options are where the meat of the game truly is. Spec Ops has been more fleshed including a survival mode where 2 players shoot through wave of bad guys. Not really original, but is a bunch of fun with a friend. And it has a progressive unlock system just like the Multiplayer, so you'll spend lots of time on this mode. The multiplayer itself is still a good one, with some changes. There is now Strike pakages, and they determine how you get your pointstreaks. Yes, Pointstreaks, because now capturing objectives and destroying enemy equipment and planes and choppers count toward your streak. Anyways, Assault is the familiar one with rewards tailored to missiles, and choppers, offensive rewards. Support is my personal favorite, me being a team player, where your streak doesn't get reset when you die, and you get more team based rewards like radars, recon drones and an Emp (I love this one). Specialist is a very odd one, as you get perks based on how high your streak gets, and which perks you decide to choose, so at 2 you might do Scavenger, then 4 is Blast shield or whatever. At 8 kills, you get all the perks that you have unlocked and get a bonus for each additional kill. If you get to that without dying, fun times. As always the weapons and perks are real interesting and has something for every type of player, and prestige mode is back for the hardcore to reset and level up again. There are some minor gripes about certain streak rewards, the choice of server type (still no dedicated servers?), and many other things. It can get frustrating when the whole other team camps and uses Quickscoping sniper tactics  to get AC130's and Juggernaught armor. But that's about the players themselves, not the game's fault. In closing, while the single player falters, the multiplayer is very fun. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a must buy. There's nothing like playing and levelng up with your buddies together.",Saen1990

Instead of a supplying a proper fighting engine, matches in T7 seem to rely heavily on ""who can get their rage move off first"". So many elements of the gameplay don't even require any sort of skill. In my book, slow motion over and over again also gets old very quickly. And in the end, it's more of a novelty or gimmick rather than an actual, thought-out fighting game mechanic.

But lack any sort of depth or execution to make them anything above below average for the home console market. The detailing on the characters is decent - heavy anime influences not withstanding - but the look of the town and the levels is bad. Samey corridors, samey trash leading up to the boss, even the boss fight rooms have little or no redeeming qualities. The ""story"" is insulting simple. Our hero Travis whats-his-cardboard-cut-out-name wants to become the best at killing people to pay for his video game habit. This leaves open some quite interesting possibilities for humor, but even here the game falls short. The humor is juvenile at best. At worst it can be described as a series of insulting simple site gags designed to amuse the target audience of pre-pubescent gamers. The combat is interesting, making full use of the Wii's gimmicky interface. But the novelty quickly fades as you are faced with the 100th encounter with the simplistic enemies. No strategy, no tactics, just button mashing. The bosses are also moronic. Most boss fights involve simply strafing in a circle around the boss and then hitting them when they execute a move. No boss shows an inkling of original programming, just lots of hit points and lots of time. Speaking of time, you are required to work and earn money to pay for _your_ hits on the higher ranked assassins. The game mechanics tackles this by forcing you to do repetitive chores around the city which involve: Collecting fruit and mowing the lawn. No joke. It's really that simple to earn a fantastic amount of money so you can get to the less boring parts. I say less boring, because the game is that: Boring. The fighting is interesting, but the endless grinding through a million identical enemies prior to the boss fight, is tedious. The innumerable hours you'll spend grinding up money for the privilege of whacking a boss with samey tactics and grinding through his legions of minions: Boring. The time you spend suffering through the cut scenes and desperately trying to get into your bosses pants: Just Pointless delay. The cut scenes and dialog is also insulting pedantic. It feels like the game was well done in Japanese - in terms of dialog - but then the American translation falls flat on it's face ""It's open mic night in hell!"", is one such example. If you're any fan of decent anime, you'll quickly pick up on how bad the translation has to be.

74022,Dishonored,PC,9,"I had previously written a rather middling review for Dishonored, giving it a '6' and calling it barebones with potential. However, since that point, I have come to realize that it is truly one of the most important and artistically driven games in the current state of the industry. Thus, I have returned to revoke my previous statement in exchange for a more positive, enlightened view onI had previously written a rather middling review for Dishonored, giving it a '6' and calling it barebones with potential. However, since that point, I have come to realize that it is truly one of the most important and artistically driven games in the current state of the industry. Thus, I have returned to revoke my previous statement in exchange for a more positive, enlightened view on the game.To begin, I would like to state that while Dishonored's core story is still, in my opinion, lacking, its lore and ambiguous backstory is absolutely fascinating, and the setting is rich in history and intrigue. Learning about Dunwall isn't as easy as picking up audio diaries or listening to conversations- you will really need to piece things together and listen to the Heart to build your own impression of what this place truly represents. The main plot remains uninteresting and somewhat half-hearted, but at least enough to keep you going along with each of your little stealthy capers.The gameplay-  oh, the glorious, glorious gameplay. Dishonored provides so many different organic choices to how you approach its levels that you feel the only way you can do the developers justice is to replay it as many times as possible. Whether it be crawling beneath tables, gunning your way through rooms, or climbing to the highest vantage point, Arkane's gem plays almost unlike any other game this generation. Your actions are performed swiftly and accurately, and for once first-person platforming is executed very well. Violent players will find a number of delightful tools to their exposure, while hardcore stealth veterans will really delve into its Thief-esque non-lethal side.Of course, the non-lethal portion of the game is still rather bare in features- I stand by the ideas of being able to shoot sleep darts through keyholes and the ability to tackle enemies in order to knock them out, as well as shadow-based visibility and water arrows. Other sneak-based spells would be highly-appreciated, but it becomes clear the further you play that Arkane clearly intended you to discover stealthy options available with otherwise-violent powers. But even as it stands, I've come to really enjoy the option of knocking out my enemies one by one, stacking them all up in a high perch with the knowledge that they'll all eventually wake up and look around at one another, feeling awkward and terrified.Dishonored's visual and level design are also excellent. It does indeed take time to appreciate all of the nuances, but they are there, and you will be happily awarded for relishing in them. The game does an excellent job of providing you with an environment that's a blast to explore but never dives into confusing, labyrinth territories, such as many adventure games with frequent loading screens. Its hub-like areas really help the overall package, as its easy to get the lay of the land and work out your strategies from there. Plenty of nooks and crannies can be exploited for the treasure-hunters out there, which really adds to the game's borderline love-letter degree of inspiration taken from Thief.Voice acting is middling to top notch, with Piero being absolutely maddening to listen to, but deep, engaging characters such as Lord Pendleton having real, tangible soul. The sound effects are high-quality work, especially the change in the pitch of sounds when transitioning from Blink or Stop Time. Two major complaints that I originally had with the game do persist, however: the ending is very sudden and unsatisfying, and the lack of a New Game Plus feature is insult to injury. In a game that focuses on collecting upgrades and powers, it seems odd that this was not a no-brainer for Arkane. The already high replay value could have been made limitless if they had continued to stack the levels of bone charms and spells. Of course, these are two of only a handful of blemishes on an otherwise sparkling game. Dishonored should be recognized and praised for being one of the few truly niche games around, aiming for the audience it knows is interested in its concepts and polishing all of those concepts to a fine sheen. Hopefully, for the sequel, Arkane will up the intrigue, go open-world, and further increase the arsenal of powers, weapons, and sneaking moves at your hands.",DoctorSpud

The atmosphere is also well-done; most of the game having a spooky paranormal aura about it. The puzzles are good and some are pretty clever, they're not too hard to figure out but there's a very well made hint system to help you if you happen to get stuck. Some parts of it are very morbid and all-around messed up, but that adds a lot to the paranormal atmosphere. The soundtrack is amazing, as well as the ambient sounds and sound FX in general. The special FX are also top-notch, pulling the game together with a very professional feel and look.Even though Year Walk has many pros, it also has a handful of cons. For starters, the map is kind of mislead, it's hard to know where you're going without checking the map every time you enter a new screen (but at least they included a map), also some of the puzzles are kinda not obvious, like you're supposed to know to chase a woman down through the woods when you didn't really even know what happened during the confrontation with her. Also, with Year Walk being a horror game, and I stand by my ideals strongly with this, horror games really demerit themselves when they utilize the dreaded ""jumpscare."" And Year Walk has a few of these, and they're totally out of place since Year Walk already has an amazingly paranormal and spooky atmosphere and strange feel about it, why throw in some cheap jumpscares and make it more like all the other mainstream horror games like Slender?Throughout Year Walk there's quite a few puzzles you need to remember a good amount of information for, so I had to actually write them down on a pad of paper, so it may be useful to have one around. Some of the puzzles are unimaginative, as well as Year Walk having a few graphical glitches, such as the ground disappearing (which happened to me in the cemetery).But overall, Year Walk is very ominous and foreboding, with amazing special FX and a fantastic soundtrack, and despite the fact that it's not sure what genre it wants to be, and the story being heavily incomplete/unexplained (and I know it's trying to be ""mysterious"" but it almost feels like the creators didn't have the story completely fleshed out so they avoided details), Year Walk is a pretty decent game. It was a toss-up between 8/10 or 7/10, but in the end I decided to go with 7/10 because of the length being too short for the amount of game play it's lacking, the story being incomplete/unexplained, and all the other cons listed above.",CaKeS

The stealth part is also very well manage with lot of possibilities to deal with them. And for the driving, the main novelty of this episode it is also very well down, the bat-mobile is as reactive and powerful that you'll dream of , unfortunately they over did it a little and you use it a bit too much in the game and you can be bored with it during time.The story is once again marvelous, Batman fan or not everybody will be committed to it, with some nice twists. There's also a lot of side activities to do (like I said a bit too much of bat-mobile in them, but also some great ones) that brings variety and length to the game ( around 50 hours for 100%).So in conclusion Arkham Knight on PS4 is great game prevented from perfection only by an overdose of bat-mobile (but I can understand them, it must have been like hell to program it as good as they did) but every super hero lovers must play this game (as well as the whole Arkham series).",BaronMonaco

There were so many glowing reviews by game journalists that I could not discount its quality, however I wasn't completely convinced of its greatness and so approached it with hope and a slight amount of pessimism.There have been many defining moments with video games that I've experienced in my life. The joy and wonder of discovering likes of Pac Man and Centipede in the arcade as a five-year-old. As I grew up and video games changed, my horizons opened up with the possibility for adventure in The Legend of Zelda on the NES. Super Mario Brothers, Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Doom and Half Life. Each of these represented major evolutional steps in video games. Exploration, adventure, 3D worlds, immersion, storytelling. I look back fondly on all of those experiences but in doing so realized that as the years have gone by these types of moments came with less frequency and impact. I love games such as Mario Galaxy, Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim. I can appreciate the mind-blowing quality and depth of these games but they don't stack up to the experiences of my youth with, arguably, vastly inferior games.It only took a short time with Journey to come to the realization that I was experiencing something that I had been missing for many years. Chills ran down my spine. My pulse quickened. I was enthralled. It was not immediate but grew like a wave, building slowly and consistently until the wave broke in a crescendo that was moving and awe-inspiring that left me speechless and teary-eyed. I had not been affected like this in years and perhaps ever.Journey is an experience that is a privilege to partake in. It evokes a range of emotions from joy and wonder to fear and heartbreak. The visuals are a sight to behold. It is simple, but not simplistic. It will make you ponder life, friendship, love, loss and triumph. Journey deserves to be experienced.",homer4president

Well you cant kill her there because...well its a dream but trust me she gets the worst deaths in the game lol. Everything isn't good in heavy rain like the controls which takes time to get used to. Many times I took a wrong turn or found myself kissing a wall but its not to distracking also parts of the story will not be explained like ethans nightmare's of drowning kids or what was he doing/where was he during his blackouts but again its not to distracting from the rest of the narrative! This is a must play for gamers  but even more so for developers because they've clearly ran out of idea's when it comes to good gameplay and story telling vs weak story and run and gun rehash! Get this game its a true diamond in a sea full on shooters!,ilovegames32

As much as I like CoD, I resent it for pushing so many good games into 2010, and taking online activity away from all other good XBL titles. But, seriously guys, please stop all the hate.

As much as I like CoD, I resent it for pushing so many good games into 2010, and taking online activity away from all other good XBL titles. But, seriously guys, please stop all the hate. True, the gameplay is almost identical as far as controls and movement go, but please take a look at...hmmm... everything else? Set-pieces are SOOO much better this time round that it's ridicuous. True, MW had you on that epic Ghillie-style stealth mission. MW2 has you crawling through snow, trying to stay unseen while surrounded by enemies before blowing up a hangar gate and escaping on snowmobiles. A few levels later, you use a Predator to blow up two huge APCs, bring down two gunships and watch a Burger King get levelled in the middle of a firefight. No comparison between the two at all. The graphics are a little bit outdated, but the engine has been souped up in every way, and you're only going to comment on how ""crap"" the gfx are if you're a complete graphics whore. People are complaning about the new guns and attachments, but they're all so great, I can't see the sense in complaining. They all feel unique, from a sawn-off shotgun (you can control which barrel to fire from using the triggers), to the barrels-of-fun automatic Glock 18 pistol. The Akimbo perk takes this one step further: imagine your favourite light machine-pistol or handgun (Mini-Uzi, Glock 18, etc.), and then imagine holding TWO OF THEM. Most games screw up dual-wielding, but it's a complete joy in MW2. True, it does have its flaws. It's not the perfect game, and it doesn't do many new things, but any complaints are drowned out by massive explosions and seas of polish. If you're a shooter fan (and by that I don't mean a profanity-spouting 8-year-old kid who happens to like Halo), ignore all of the haters. Ignore the jaded fans who want CoD to do something new and become some kind of portal-based puzzle shooter. You want this game. Now.",TaimurS.

After the first hour the story just goes away, most of what is left is in the tapes you listen to and then a 2 min cutscene is sparsely dotted around every 10 hours or so.  There are no characters like you had in the other games, everyone is largely forgettable, the voice acting for the male actors is bad, they all sound too similar. There are no boss fights as you'd expect from a MGS game, no moments like you had with The End in MGS3 or Psycho Mantis from MGS.The world is empty and really annoying to travel through since you constantly have big rocks stopping you from going places, it really feels more like a series of funnels. All the content is in the outposts, but they all have the same objectives of sneak past guards to get to something to either kill or extract. They never do anything clever with the gameplay, it always plays the same and I got bored quickly. The previous games were much more like Mario where Nintendo constantly finds new things to do with the gameplay with each level. However in MGSV It's like doing Hideouts in Watchdogs over and over again. I don't even see why the world is there, it serves no reason but for you to travel across, which is boring. I'd have much preferred a single location like the Tanker in MGS or Shadow Moses, at least then the map would have character, rather than the generic outposts of MGV.The controls are very clunky, it doesn't control well at all, there is no jump button either so you'll constantly get stuck on trying to negotiate Snake over and around them. Constantly I found myself in prone and not able to get Snake to turn around, so I'd end up just having Snake moving backwards all the time, which mirrors left and right and that is so annoying.I think MGSV is a very mediocre game, it's like Kojima got Western open world game envy and decided to copy it. It's not satisfying with the story, which to me is the biggest crime since MGS has always been about the story. Why make a big deal out of getting Kiefer Sutherland if you aren't going to use him? I swear I only heard him talk like 5 times  throughout the game.I fully expect a backlash to happen, in the same vein as GTA IV.",TixyLix

He's an adorable and very charismatic creature by the way. The objective is to escape from a fortress inside a crater and Trico's big size and strength will be necessary to overcome puzzles and obstacles, and also to defeat enemies (the boy can't defeat them all by himself). But to command his actions is not that simple. He's an animal after all and to make him execute one task you will need to repeat gestures and commands a lot do make Trico figure what you want him to do. Also, he gets hungry sometimes and we'll refuse to work if you don't bring food.I see what developers tried to do, make him look and feel like a real animal. For most of time it works very well, but now and then Trico will test your patient. He gets distracted very often and sometimes we'll do what he wants to do. You'll need to constantly ask for his attention to execute every task and i can some people getting annoyed by this, specially during one particular sequence where Trico needs to dive. It's the most frustrating bit of the game by far and will probably get a lot of tries and swearing to beat this part. Honestly, i still can't say what i did wrong.Also, the controls are not perfectly responsive, specially when i was trying to drop from Trico's body. The boy keeps getting stick on his feathers and the camera gets crazy. Jumping from a rope or chain to a platform is also very imprecise.However, all the struggle to command Trico and constant fighting with the controls and camera are absolutely worth.

The main story of the game self is a Overall Half-Life 2 is nothing special. Probably one of the most overrated games ever. So what makes Half-Life 2 such a normal game? Let us look at the story. While there are definitly some interesting concepts and ideas behind the game, the game isn't that full of background storytelling parts. Here and there are some hints. But nothing more. The main story of the game self is a typical snitcher story, mixed with a typical story about resistance against an evil power. The side characters aren't really convincing. Dr. Kleiner has become the typical crazy professor. You won't get that ""This my colleague""-feeling from Half-Life 1 anymore. Alyx is supposed to be your sidekick / girlfriend. Most of her appereances in the game just seem to be forced. Dog seems to be one of these characters you'll mostly find in Disney movies. You know what I mean? The kind of cute looking characters, which are mostly put into Disney movies in order to entertain smaller children watching the movie. Now let's get to the gameplay: You'll have various different weapons, have the possibility to drive some vehicles and fight trough a variety of maps. Now where's the problem? The weapons are not very innovative. Most of them were just taken from Half-Life 1 and were getting new skins. But one of the most popular Half-Life 1 weapons, the Gauss gun was even removed. The Gravity Gun is fun to use for the first time. But it get's pretty old very fast. Especially since it's use is mostly limited on close-combat as well as on the availability of physical objects near you. The game has some puzzles in which the Gravity Gun helps. But overall these puzzles are all too simple. You don't get a feeling of joy after you solved one of the puzzles. There are no rewards for them available. The only reason you are doing the puzzles is in order to progress in the game. But there's no other motivation behind them. The vehicles chases are definitly fun but also too long. All you do is rushing trough some very nice and detailled looking industrial and costal areas while clearing the map from every enemy you see. Walking through these levels makes you feel like more could have been done with them. And now let us get about the enemies. Overall the range of enemies in Half-Life 2 is quite short. You will mostly end up making a genocide on Combines, with the difference that the skin changes the more you progress. While Headcrabs and Zombies make again an appearence in the game, the game lacks of completely new NPCs. What happened with the other Xen monsters which were teleported to earth? Why not more different Combine soldiers? Overall Half-Life 2 is a nice game, but it's not innovative, there's nothing real new in it which you didn't saw anywhere before. There was definitly some huge potential in the game, but it feels like the developers didn't followed a clear concept as they made the game. The source engine delivers great graphics and physics and is a nice platform for various kind of mods and machinimas.",AnonymousCriticAnon

These are just a few of the many. There is no story, and that's fine, that's what it was made to be, something so stupid and ridiculous you can't help but laugh. However as fun as this may all seem it ends almost as soon as it begins.The first thing you're going to notice is how fast you run and never get tired, add that with how shockingly small the map is there is no need for auto/fast travel. You will never take any fall damage and it is almost impossible to die, even on Hard. While the cyber vision is a cool feature you will never use it making it worthless. It claims to help point out enemies, but every single enemy is drastically highlighted in a neon cloud before you even see the enemy itself, in fact, everything but the grass and trees are covered in neon lights. The A.I. is borderline non-existent, a liner script of walk to point A to point B and shoot the player. The side-missions only add an illusion of a sandbox game. There are only two types, Hostage Rescue and Hunt. The fort capture adds more to that illusion. There's also T.V. sets and V.H.S. tapes to find around the map to complete the illusion of a sand box game. Yet if it wanted to be a sand box, it would be much larger and would not have every single item, animal, base and enemy on your map.There are two types of enemies you're going to run into. Animals, and Androids. The models are the exact same for the androids except for some very minor change to look like a different class. The animals can be said the same for their type. The weapons again are made on references to films, while there are upgrades for half of the weapons, they are worthless and do not help in any manner.The gameplay is the now required linear go to point A, shoot and blow up, rinse, repeat. The story itself (ignoring the side missions, bases, etc.) will be completed in under an hour, and because the weapons are so powerful and no skill at all is required to play any part of this game you may even do it in under 45 minutes. Adding in the other things, you might get about 2  4 hours out of it. All in all, if you want to relive an '80's experience, are a fan of Michael Biehn, or want to laugh at pure stupidity then this is it, but for $15 it's not worth it, maybe for $10 or $5",UnbiasedOne

The main campaign is not so long, about 10 hours, but felt boring for most of the time.

But what about  your partners? They very rarely get attacked or kill someone, they don´t run out of ammo..... They are like an imaginary friend that follows you around. Some of them would ask you for cover so they can take shelter, but instead of taking shelter they will put them shelves in the line of fire between you and your enemies.Also there are very few types of enemies and I dont think the ones that look like lizards blend in the resident evil franchise. They seem to have come out of Turok or something. Just like the scanner reminds of Metroid Prime. Its main use here is to scan enemies to get herbs, or scan places to get other items, but you are already overflowed with ammo and herbs. The progress bar to get one herb fells very anti climatic. I think it could have been better if the scanner found weak points on each specific enemy so you could beat them more easily, it would have fitted the game much more than a progress bar to get extra herb, and the final effect would have been the same (easier survival).Otherwise, the 3d effect, extra modes and features you can unlock, sound and graphics are good.

I personally thought it was brilliant, moving the series in a new direction and setting up a fantastic jump-off point for Halo 6. I also want to stress what others have been saying: FAMILIARIZE YOURSELVES WITH THE LORE. That cannot be stressed enough. The missions are tons of fun though, harder than they used to be given the increased number of enemies in each area. But already I can think of a few absolutely great moments from the campaign that I think I'll remember for a while to come. The only complaint I will make is a very noticeable lack of characterization for the new characters, especially disappointing for Blue Team, making their debut in the games universe.From the little I've seen of the multiplayer, it's very fun. I played a Warzone match that surprised me with just how balanced it was. With REQ (Requisitions), boss and AI enemies, and a large, evolving map, it would be easy for it to devolve into a **** but it is incredibly well done. I'm also very glad they made SWAT a highlight; it has always been my favourite Halo game mode.Now, even though I give the game a solid 9 for great campaign and excellent online, I need to lambast 343i for their omission of split-screen. I have been quite upset that I can't play this with my roommate, as we have played through every other game, and I have heard the sad stories of many others who feel like they've lost something that helped connect them to friends and family. The decision to omit split-screen for a 60 FPS framerate is, in my opinion, absurd. This 60 FPS movement has gained traction out of nowhere, for no purpose, and frankly I'm sick of it. I couldn't give two **** if The Last of Us 2 is 60 FPS, and the same goes for any other that has been or will be announced. When you leave out such a core feature from your game to please your publisher with ammo for their marketing, you need to look at yourself as a developer and think again. If you stop advertising 60 FPS, there will be no riots. There will be no pushback. No one cares. It's a gimmick, and an excusable one until it starts making your games less fun.

Brought me back to the old Unreal Tournament days, which were great at Multiplayer (note to Activision, these worked..learn!)The Campaign, while short was fun to do. But as all COD games have had short Campaigns, I had no expectations for a longer one. Ultimately, long term COD players buy the game for the Multiplayer, not the single.But the same issues with the Multiplayer maps still exist as have always done. The amount of times i get shot in the back far outweighs the front shots(and vice versa), mainly because the spawn system permanently places new spawns in flanking positions. This becomes infuriating when you look down a path, see no-one, only to be shot 5 secs later as someone spawned behind you.The maps are built on a circular spawn system, so actively encouraging flanking and backstabs. and you can do nothing about it. We need maps and spawns with sides and make people meet each other on equal terms. Older maps like Nuketown, while manic, at least meant I know where my enemy will be, and made the game a lot more fun.On top of this, Lag seems to be an issue on the PS3 version, obviously the port has flaws, and having screen lag while trying to avoid been fragged is annoying, as 9/10 you end up dying!Weapons are the old tried and tested..and we're still mssing the old awards like MDK..they were fun, put them back in.And making weapons level dependent is also annoying. This means that a level 40 has a lot more choice and usually of the best stuff than a level 10. Not to mention the care packages with elite weapons. Better either to unlock everything or at least make it a buy with points(AKA ghosts), so I can get the weapons etc I want early enough to put me on equal footing with the lvl 40's.",Bossuk

RotTR is a right mixture of action and exploration. It reminded me of the previous TR games (AotD and Legend). Great game, which will fill several of your evenings with a spectacular, breathtaking adventure and won't make you bored. It continues the idea implemented in the first part and converts it into a decent sequel. With the latest 1.06 patch the game provides a very smooth experience. Kudos to Nixxes!

Contrary to what professional reviews pretend, CK examplifies how to fail at both. This is as much an RPG as my grandfather was the imperatrix of Samoa. Hack n' slash, yes, with your hero mowing nondescript units without your intervention. Leveling, artefacts, and everybody's personal favorite, the escort quest, don't make it an RPG either.The RTS part generously includes not building anything, which again is a turn off for me because it means it's going to be battles after battles. These battles are just a mess, to put it simply. The way units look, are controlled, move and are animated, one would really need a slow mo and a magnifying glass to follow what's happening.Your units can starve. Quickly. From experience, it always sounds like a bad idea to include such mechanics. On the paper, it kind of appeals, but it's really hard to implement without introducing a huge hassle. CK handles that pretty well, all things considered, mainly because it uses only 2 resources. Still, after a while, sending mules becomes really tedious.If you forget about Gaul and take it as classic heroic fantasy shenanigans, try CK, as there is nothing really bad with the mechanics.

What this turns into is bassicaly an RTS for the console, there is no defence just attack attack attack, there is no base building just attack attack attack, indeed while attacking is the key focus of this game i find it so slow and repetative that i get board watching my heavy bolter team waddle slowly towards some cover, while my oponants attempt to slowly waddle towards my position only to be instantly supressed and for there commander to hit the recall button for them to return to base. The multiplayer matches last a max of 15 mins each if you have played C&C 3 multiplayer before and im assuming that you have, and have probebly stopped playing it along with everyone else becouse it gets boring FAST! this game gets boring FAST! I got board of it in the Beta thats how fast you get board. Over all as far as RTS go the multiplayer and skirmish is not fun, if you on the otherhand have ever thought hey I wish RTS got rid of all that boring base building and got strait onto fighting, but you wished the fighting involved eldely men who will die at any second of high colestrol and can only amble around the battlefeild at walking pace while screaming about the good old days of Halo 2 when games lasted only 3 minutes this is the game for you, infact I emplore you to buy it becouse you will buy the craptastic DLC relic will spew from its anus every 2 weeks for live points. All in All its probebly becouse im a turtler in RTS which is a valid tac in team games, however this game removes all defence style strats, so you cant really do that... therefore alienating half of all RTS players in one go, if you play defence in RTS's you will HATE this game dont even bother, go play company of heroes as the brits and artillary people from the otherside of the map behind you massive stronghold of AT guns and morters. SINGLEPLAYER!! yea this is the big thing... well not according to relic its not but it is.. bassicaly this plays like one of those standard issue C&C or starcraft or infact any RTS game mission where you dont have a base, theres multiple objectives with multiple paths and you have to decide, theres also loot so bassicaly your playing world of warcraft except less fun as a group of slow waddling old people in armor, this is what saves the game for me, yes its repetative, yes the gameplay gets boring quickly as with the rest of the entire game, but the storyline drives you along, you really want to see what happens to this group of eldely ""BURN THE HERETIC"" marines on there slow quest to collect there pensions. So pretty much, if you liked dawn of war you probebly wont like this, if you liked company of heroes you probebly wont like this, if you liked homeworld you probebly wont like this, however if you enjoy smashing your face into an xbox controler while screaming FAG over the microphone to a bunch of 13 year old mexicans on a game of GTA4 this will be the RTS for you, infact its not really an RTS its more of a QTE becouse you just mash the build devasator squad and then mash the move to commander button over and over till you win/lose it wont really matter eitherway becouse itl be 10 minutes over and then you will go off and play some TF2 or subcom or a game that takes more tactical thinking like pong! over all 6/10 I was gonna give it a 7 but found out I coudent make space marine chapters with a dick or nazi symbol or a middle finger on there shoulders, this is largly down to relic releasing these 3 chapters in the ""community pack"" later this year for 599 microsoft points, there will also be adding realtime weapon change while there at it.",STARSBarry

26121,The Last of Us Remastered,PlayStation4,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This was the first game I played when I bought a PS4, I must say I was very impressed. The graphics are compelling, the environment is immersive, walking through a deserted suburb neighborhood, looking at all the abandoned houses, piles of burnt bodies, and flooded cities, and how Joel and Tess are so numb from the apocalypse that killing someone is just an everyday thing, makes you think what people are capable of when the situation is so grave. The story is unlike anything I've experienced in a video game, the ending really leaves you in the dark in some ways, and that's okay. It almost leaves you to decide what goes through Ellie's mind when she said that final ""okay"" and then the game cuts to black. It has one of the most intense multiplayer experiences I've played, the 4v4 matches, while it may sound very boring, Naughty Dog really did a great job with it. It feels like real combat, you're always behind cover, planning your course of action, hoping an enemy isn't around the corner when you have no ammo while they're fully loaded ready to go. Every time I die, it feels like I really die, and that I didn't help out my team enough, and I've never felt this playing a game. It really requires you to communicate with your teammates, plan out tactics, call out enemies, or just go lone wolf and hope for the best. The maps for the most part, are well designed, it could use more game modes, leveling up can be quite difficult at times, but overall, its really an above average experience in my opinion.

The graphicsI've never written a review of a computer game before but felt compelled to by seeing all the positive reviews.  I don't know if it's because I'm probably a bit older than the average gamer, or because I don't really feel too strong an affinity with RPG systems, but I have never been so disappointed by a game.I'll focus on the positive first; the reason it got five stars. The graphics are tremendous, don't get me wrong, you know you're still in a computer game but the landscape is very well balanced. The lighting is warm and the sunsets are long. Animations are smooth and responsive. It is a beautiful game. Also, the scope for developing the character is very wide - I imagine one could spend a good deal of time and thought developing the character's skill set. Unfortunately, I can't stretch my positive comments any further. Here are a few critiques.Open world games are the epitome of gaming as far as I'm concerned. I never quite get a feeling of immersion in a restricted world. GTA and Skyrim of course come to mind, and I'm aware that there are plenty of comparisons out there so I'm just covering the same ground. Now, Witcher 3 had a world much larger than Skyrim's, and I admit I never explored too much of it, but I did get to the edge of the world a number of times, something which it took me weeks to do in Skyrim. This just pulled me out of the fantasy and reminded me that I was in a constructed world. Perhaps I'm asking too much, but why not just make the terrain impassable or an ocean / plain?Which brings me onto my second critique; the nature of the world. Initially I was amazed by how familiar the world looked, the forests looked like forests I'd visited, the gentle rise and fall, the shallow canyons and the density of the trees was all great. Unfortunately, I found it all too regular. I could ride for five minutes and encounter nothing new. I'd still be in a forest. The villages and towns were all strikingly similar. Yes, all the characters had interesting little animations, but ultimately it was all quite mundane. Compare this with Skyrim, where you have huge stone ruins and each city has its own character. I fear the designers weren't quite on their game when it came to creativity; I want sublimity not technical accomplishment. Even compared to GTA which is simply a city in the real world, you have such a wealth of different environments that the world feels vastly different within a few minutes walk.My final main critique is the acting. It was simply atrocious. Skyrim was bad, GTA was pretty good, excellent in fact. But the acting in Witcher 3 was like some terrible made-for-tv movie. Maybe it's good for a game, but I really did laugh all the way through. The story that the acting was meant to carry too, was very basic. I understand that story-telling in a game is still a developing field compared to film or literature, but it doesn't detract from the fact that this was very linear and tedious. Even the was the story unravels was fairly plain; talk to this guy, then talk to this guy. One interesting development was using the scent trails, at least it was interesting the first time. After that it was pointless, why not just highlight them on a map?Anyway, I'll call it a day. I found the game tedious, the story mundane and the landscape simply plain.",sp001

For its time, the game was brilliant both in terms of gameplay and in terms of portraying a deeper story than typical action games, over-the-top gore and silly sex mini-games notwithstanding. The game spawned two main sequels, and several side-quels/prequels, finally culminating in God of War III, by which point Kratos had basically killed everything in Greek mythology.Now, however, the team has brought him back, some decades later, aging, and with a kid to raise on his own, having just lost his wife. Also, he's somehow come from Ancient Greece to Midgard (shortly before the beginning of Ragnarok). Fans of my books will find some similarities in interpretation of the setting, though only some.While the original games were great, I'm going to come straight out and say the new game, also titled God of War, outstrips all of them in terms of both gameplay and story.And I'm not just saying that because I'm the ""Norse mythology guy.""I actually like Greek mythology as much or more than Norse. But this time, the team has taken a fresher spin on the myths for reasons beyond simply justifying Kratos needing to kill Heracles or whatever. Plus, both the character and the story have matured. Kratos still has the rage inside of him, but now he knows how destructive that rage can be to himself and everyone around him. He knows vengeance isn't going to solve anything.But he's still willing to kill anything and everything that stands in the way of his goals.However, he's also dealing with the pain of losing his wife (and yes, I know the same was true in the first game) and of trying to raise a child to be better than he was.In terms of gameplay, God of War takes some definite cues from Dark Souls, probably enough to qualify for the Souls-like genre. Which is great, considering that style of challenging but rewarding ARPG has become my definitive favorite genre in recent years. A few aspects of the game feel like the old ones, including the occasional puzzle (which I didn't feel added much to the game, save nostalgia for one aspect I didn't miss in the first place). The combat feels a bit different than either Souls or old school GOW, but, basically, it's a system that punishes mistakes while rewarding mastery of the mechanics and learning enemy fighting styles.Kratos--for the first time, unless I'm mistaken--now has to block attacks on a shield, which is incredibly important here, as it also allows parries. Oh, and he lays into his foes with a big ass axe that returns when he throws it, ala Thor's hammer in the Marvel movies. Most of the time, enemies can down Kratos in a few hits if you get careless or too aggressive. On the other hand, when you get a rhythm going, Kratos feels like, well, a god of war.While the game does feature some platformer-ish exploration, there's far less platformer challenges to this one. Meaning--praise the Aesir--nothing quite so irritating as the underworld spinning blade columns.All this said, it shouldn't surprise you to hear I loved this game. If you own a PS4, get this game.",mattlarkin

In fact the roster has 35 characters, each one with his personal style, also the customization is really huge. You can unlock new items by playing the treasure mode, as long as you play you will increase your offline rank up to ""Tekken God Prime"", which is separated from the online rank. The story mode has a duration around four hours, if you wish you can play it again at the ""ten stars difficulty"", which is really hard. In the arcade you will fight against 5 characters but in the end there aren't a cutscenes for the fighters. These are the only three single player modes unfortunately, but the online is great. On the pc version there isn't input lag, the game finds very quickly a new opponent and it's hard to lose the connection.The new gameplay innovation is the rage mode, it will be activated when the health is at 40%, by pressing RB (for the xbox gamepad) you will unleash a powerful combo that will deal a huge amount of damage. As long as you will not activate the rage mode, all your damage is increased so you must choose well.Tekken 7 is a great game, with a huge roster, a good scalability (you can play the game with an old pc, but you need to set your graphic settings to medium or low) and a good network mode. If you are a Tekken fan or a competitive player you must add this game to your collection.Pros:- The netcode is stable;- So many options with a good scalability;- None input lag;- Unique style;- The story is not complicated.Cons:- Only three single player modes;- Poor arcade mode.",Cramenorn

Multiplayer matchmaking is dead, which is sad as co-op missions seem like fun.As for those who keep saying this is much worse than the old games like Chaos theory, I slightly disagree, its not significantly better or worse. I am ok with the slightly more streamlined and faster paced direction they have taken, the difference is not as big as many make it out to be.As a console port, this is fairly good. There is sadly a checkpoint save system, but it is not as bad as in many other games. Otherwise, there are enough settings, no mouse acceleration and skippable cutscenes.

The game is very dark (as in dark-fantasy), which I just love.There isn't much I don't like about this game. I only have two gripes with this game: the controls and the camera. The VERY FIRST THING you MUST do when you launch the game is CHANGE THE KEY-BINDINGS. I can't stress this enough. This game is a console-port, but the controls aren't that bad once you change them to be more PC-friendly. After configuring the key-bindings, the controls aren't an issue (although some puzzles are a bit wacky; one even showed Xbox buttons instead of keyboard buttons!). Second, the camera. This is more of a personal preference, but I do not like the camera very much. It's fine most of the time, but I find it simply odd other times. Third-person, with the ability to look around, would have suited this game much better, but they would have to change the game quite a bit to make this work, so the camera is not much of an issue for me.I love this game, and I simply cannot wait for Lords of Shadow 2.

You could OBVIOUSLY see that it looked nothing like him. Live has better face-scans and you do it from your phone!

82174,Fallout 3,PC,6,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Fallout 3 is the Fifth game in the Fallout Franchise and the first game in the series published by Bethesda. The game runs on the engine used for Elder Scrolls: Oblivion and brings the games from a top-down perspective to a third-person/first-person perspective.FO 3 departs from the original setting of the West Coast of California and centers itself squarely in the ruins of Post-Apocalyptic Washington, DC. As Bethesda itself is in neighboring Maryland, it's no surprise that the ruined DC looks great. There's a nice atmosphere going, aside from the excessive green tint to everything.Your character is a Vault Dweller, raised in Vault 101 by your single father, James. James tries to instill virtues into your character as you grow up, and then when you're 19, he ditches you and escapes the Vault for who knows why. And that begins your quest to catch up with him out in the Wasteland.As an RPG, the game is rather primitive. When you have a choice, you tend to only have two - good vs. evil, with a third option far too rare. And even when you make a choice, it generally doesn't affect more of the story, which is a failure of the writing team. Instead, the game relies heavily on combat and action, so having more charismatic or 'intellectual' characters in the Wasteland rarely fits.But as an action shooter, it's inconsistent, especially early on. Your ability to hit is based on your 'skill' from the RPG mechanics, so having a low skill those will put you in trouble rather quickly. Many of the areas you have to travel through as part of your quests are set up as linear 'action stages' - some of which deliver a healthy dose of combat, while some miss out on great opportunities. I thought the big climax fight of the main story from the Citadel to the Purifier could have been much more grand if Liberty Prime weren't involved and it was just you, your follower, and a squad of elite Paladins assaulting the enemy forces.Ultimately, Fallout 3 doesn't know what it is. It's not a great RPG because it relies on action and shooting. It's not a great shooter because it relies on RPG mechanics and fails to deliver at key moments.The result is somewhere in-between shooter and RPG. It offers more choices to a fan of shooters than they usually get, but pigeonholes fans of sandbox RPGs into linear action sequences.",ElectricDevil

The problem with RoTR is that it is veeeeery similar to the reboot.The graphics are fantastic and but the gameplay is pretty run of the mill, its just not a big enough step up from a few years ago. Upgrades are back and straight forward, but sometimes they go too far by giving her too many buffs and advantages. The story is just more Tomb Raider, its Indiana Jones, rinse and repeat; Lara gets in the usual predicaments, captured, thrown around, beaten down, stranded etc. Again, its really nothing new, but what else could I expect?The Tomb's are actually present in this game and are a welcome addition, they're all relatively straight forward puzzle rooms which, when solved, result in unlocking an upgrade which will aid in over powering you further.Combat is as expected, solid third person action, stealth and cover based shooting. Stuff is scattered around the environment which can be used to craft bombs, molotovs etc. all of which are handy and can be buffed by upgrades to make them even more powerful.The environment is pretty spectacular as expected and varied to fit the theme, dangerous animals populate each section which (of course) can be killed and looted for supplies.Collectables are scattered literally everywhere, collecting them awards you with XP, there are all sorts of things to pick up, most of which unlock the usual ""guy reading letter"" type reward, seriously do developers actually think people listen to these things?! Every time Lara first sits at a campfire she goes into a monologue about what she's going though, I found these tiresome and didn't really compliment the experience as a whole.The backtracking because you don't have certain upgrades/equipment is a total bore. Its a sign of the developer trying to milk the game so it takes longer to complete. I feel its totally unnecessary and when you do eventually track back to past areas you are too OP for anything to cause you a worry. I can't stand this type of gameplay! And ""Score Attack"", don't get me started.Lastly the game is too easy, even on Survivor difficulty it doesn't really offer up much of a challenge.RoTR is really average, by the end of the game it capitulates into out right plagiarism, the final boss ""battle"" is a rip of of Ellie vs David from Last of Us, super, super dumbed down, and way easier.  Lara is a one-woman-killing machine who, frankly, belongs in something like COD because of the way she dolls out punishment.

All you can do is complete the game, there's nothing else to do after and during the game. You're free to explore, fight and obtain Platinum but there's no side stories or puzzles or anything like that which makes exploration pointless. In previous FF games, you're free to take a break from the main story to complete a series of side quests. None of that is presented in this game so it's likely that I'll never play this game, after completing it, again. A good game overall, but it doesn't do justice for the best JRPG franchise.

This is the best indie game that have ever played and is a full proof that money isn't everything what it takes to have sucess into some work. The biggest right thing about this hole game is the immersiveness that it provides for those who play, a lot of aspects that put you all the way inside of the game feeling like the characters, suffering or just watching. The game have a nice story that is presented to us during the journey that you gonna enjoy and feel with Senua, basically without spoiling anything, Senua needs to reach the goddess of death, Hela, to try something. Senua is a Celtic warrior that had her tribe annihilated by the vikings.This game is based on the Norse mythology, and if you like and know it, surely, you will like this game a lot, you will recognize a bunch of aspects and dialogues that happens during the game, the characters tha show up and tell you something or that you gotta face it, and if you don't know the mythology, you will learn a lot, this game is culture as well. The collectibles of this game are the called lorestones, they will tell a little part of this Norse story and let you know a little more about their beliefs and culture at that time, wich was awesome.The fact that Senua does have schizophrenia makes everything more interesting, because you may caught you asking if all of that is real, but for a schizophrenic person it is, even if that is all in her head, but it is. Sometimes when she looks at you, you feel like you are just one more ghost that it is in her head, and that was awesome.The environment of the game are all just perfect, scenarios are all very well done, the details make everything so real and believable wich makes everything better. The sounds are other big deal in here, probably the best aspect of the hole game, you gotta play it with headsets on, the ""3D sounds"" make this game unique, the character of Senua, does have voices in her head, you hearing them from everywhere, and hearing the enviroment like rivers, bush and stuff, it is a big differential here. A lot of times you got scary because of all the aspects of the game working together, scenario and sounds, walking trought strange forests or full dark places.The battle system is great, it isn't much complex but still very miscellaneous, letting you do combos, dodge, pary and all of that in a peculiar way, with the cam stuck and very close, you need to hear the voices in Senua's head to know when someone is getting to your back to attack you. All the boss battles are phenomenal, since the first one and until the last are all great and very creative, during some fights i just didn't want it to end cause of how badass that was, because of the visuals, the song and the fight itself, all gorgeous.The puzzles that the game have are, in most, very good, somethings that really will put you in thinking mode and definely in searching mode, some things that are needed to open doors and stuff, you gott to find some templates to fit into the mold, and that worked out very well.The camera got some tricks that maybe bother some people, but for me was a very smart way to put things in table. First of all the game posses no HUD at all, for me that was great, make things more realistic and to got yourself asking that things like ""I think that he is almos done"" but just for what you are seing in the battle, isn't the most commom thing these days and i did appreciated it a lot. The camera is very close and locked in the character, the movies are very limited, you could take this as a problem or, like me, think that is like a narrative resource to show how Senua is in the situations, without much to do or go, she is locked in her journey. During some cutscenes that the character is talking to someone, the camera goes straight to her face and she looks exactly to our face, like she is really talking to us in some moments, for me that was just great.The big deal here is most likely the engagement that the developers had while doing the character of Senua, the study that they did with schizophrenia, taking interviews with doctors and patients to do it in the most perefect way as possible, the hallucinations and voices in this game are all formidable and well deserved, the story is great and the gameplay is also pretty well done. The interpretive and metaphoric final is great, giving to us some sort of teaching in how to deal with mourning.",ViniciusBrito

This game is PS3 Exclusive and, my god, it is awesome. With up-to-date graphics and mechanics mixed with original story and the feeling of that survival instinct, this game really feels like a true story of survival and struggle. The game has also great upgrade system, crafting and journal using Joels backpack. The character development is also excellent, seeing Joel turn from a lowly smuggler into a tough guy and sadistic torturer. The games combat and exploration mechanics, as mentioned, are fantastic. From trying to reach a certain place to eliminating rooms full of enemies silently. The game also has a lot of different weapons from machetes and bows to sawed-off shotguns and flamethrowers. Weapons can be upgraded at a workbench with scrap metal that you can find by exploring. Even though the game has variety of weapons, the ammunition is limited, you must shoot with precision and make almost every shot count. You also can craft first-aid kits, nailbombs, molotov  sugar-explosives that work as smokescreen and of course: homemade prison shanks for opening treasure rooms and taking out enemies more quickly and silently than choking them to death.

Even though the graphics could have been somewhat better, especially on PC, the game runs as smooth as butter; I haven't crashed or frozen or even stuttered once on my 60 hour (so far) trek throughout Drangleic.Dark Souls II, like it's predecessor, has a wealth of content, in areas to explore; enemies to conquer; equipment to find and use, and play styles to suit your preferences. It also stays true to it's punishing nature, where it seems to try to put the player and enemies on a more level playing field, instead of the player being a walking army, taking on thousands without breaking a sweat, like many other games.In my experience, in comparison to Dark Souls I, bosses do seem to be somewhat easier, at least in the early areas; but this does not mean they are not challenging! Oh no, they still pose a challenge to the unprepared, but even if they end up being easier than you'd expect, From Software still makes a great effort to make the bosses (or even normal enemies) look intimidating!The game is designed to kill you, everything wants to kill you, and you will die, a lot. Much of the game is trial and error, so once you get used to how enemies fight, their attack patterns or spell uses, things become more manageable... but not easy!Online play and interactions are a huge part of Dark Souls. Other players, as well as you, can leave helpful, pointless, or potentially dangerous messages all around the world, designed to help or hinder a player's progress. You can also leave a 'summon sign' on the ground around the world, allowing you to be summoned into another player's world as a Phantom to help them in their travels, or with a difficult boss... or both! For the more sinister players, there is the option to 'invade' another player's world, allowing you to enter their game as a Dark Spirit and try to kill them. Each of these features are supported by in-game-world 'Covenants' (somewhat like guilds, but not really). These provide certain bonuses for completing tasks appropriate for each Covenant. For example: One of the covenants is focused on Co-op, so for each successful summon, and defeat of a boss, in another player's world, earns you an item which you can use to further your Rank in that Covenant, and be rewarded with items!The New Game+ feature adds even more to Dark Souls II (also just like Dark Souls I), with new items appearing throughout your second play-through, as well as certain enemies appearing in new places, and of course, increased difficulty. The NG+ feature (from what I've heard) can increase up to TEN times (the difficulty goes up each time too)!

112183,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,PC,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Ok, lets get it rolling...minor spoilers ahead. I'm a XCOM Veteran who played xcom, TFTD and Apocalypse pretty much at release. The original is (and probably always will be) the best game I've ever played. The new XCom comes quite close to that, albeit being quite different in many aspects. I'll quickly say how I feel about the game and then I'll address a few of the complaints some players have. Pro: - good feel of progression (research, foundry, officers school, skill tree, psi-lab)- combat mechanics make for fast, yet tactical gameplay- narrative much stronger than in the old game, though it's no ""game of thrones""- Action-Cam can look great and usually adds to the atmosphere- new Mission types- IronMan-ModeCons: - no randomly generated maps- Interceptions have the appeal of an afterthought- Graphics seem a little outdated- Visual Bugs (Clipping)I obviously love the game. I'm in my 3rd playthrough (which is usually a bit shorter than in the original game) and it just doesn't get boring. The new additions and the decisions to let go of some of the old mechanics were spot on, in my opinion. Many players dislike the fact, that you only have one base you can design for yourself. You still have a few more ""bases"" as the game progresses, but they're mere hangars for your interceptors. But that never bothered me, since that was one of the smarter approaches in the old game anyways and I think, the developers took that into account. I would always have just one main base (with 2 skyrangers max), since the skyranger had huge mileage. You could fly to a crash site on the other side of the planet and still hover and wait for daylight. I'd build small cheap bases early on, with the best radar available and 2 hangars for interceptors. So for me, nothing changed with the new XCOM in regards to my approach to basebuilding.Also the new base-building mechanic allows for quite some depths itself, due to the adjacency bonus and rising costs as you dig deeper.But many criticize the ""dumbing down"" of the tactical combat,mainly due to the removal of time units. I, on the other hand, think the new 2-move system is actually more challening at times. It makes for a quicker and more action-packed gameplay, yes, but it also forces you to make some difficult decisions. The new reaction shot mechanic (overwatch) also works much better and can now be a very reliable tool. The addition of a comprehensible cover-system (although it took some time to really get the hang of it) really worked. At first, I was a little disappointed with the research tree, but if you take the foundry and the officers school into account it actually feels like there's more complexity than in the original (which, like TFTD, had some seriously game-breaking bugs .when it comes to research). The addition of complexity doesnt end there: The ability tree quickly blew away my initial concerns of what seemed like a rather limited array of abilites in the beginning. No aimed shot, no autofire? You will unlock similar abilites (though only with specific classes) and many more as you progress.Yes, the class-system: what a good desicion to integrate that mechanic. I always love seeing that true and old RPG element being used in other genres. Don't get me wrong: XCOMs skilltrees don't have the same complexity like the ones of rpgs like dragon age, baldurs gate or diablo/titan quest, but they still allow for some synergy within the tree aswell as with other classes. So you can have different yet sensible approaches on how to skill your soldier. What still kinda sucks is intercepting UFOs. It wasn't spectacular in the old game and it didn'T really improve with the new version. Yes, just like in the old version, there can be some tension when your interceptor gets close to being shot down, but thats it when it comes to thrilling moments. There are some new additions, which quickly lost their appeal when I found out that instead of going with a cooldown system, the abilities were de facto consumables. But, and thats a another complaint, there are not many interceptions in the first place. It could get a little tedious in the old games, but they may have overcompensated a little in the 2012 version. On the other hand, there's no shortage of missions, just not many crash sites (maybe they aren't that satisfied with the arial combat themselves). The new mission types are a welcome addition, though not ground-breaking. But they force you to adjust your playingstyle which actually makes for a welcome change of pace once in a while. Which reminds of one more criticism: the lack of generated maps. I assume, that the coversystem called for some sort of consideration when it came to designing the maps, but I think this could have been solved. Overall a great game, simplified but not dumbed down, as many would have you belie",sgtStones

After all we will have a game, a real game which has a sole purpose of making gamers feel like you are walking in the shoes of a mighty wizard, powerful warrior or even a sneaky assasin.

I also think the rating for this game is so high, because the first release was so bad. I might have found out other cool things that i would maybe have liked but i am not keeping on playing a game that keeps me disappointed while i am running around, desperately looking for something i might like…IMHO ffxiv is nothing more than another, very common MMORPG, with a very common  fighting system, a decent story and a very poor soundtrack. If you do not mind and you are not searching for something new or different and pay for a game like that  feel free to try out anytime.PROSThe graphic is nice even though it did not make me say „wow“ on one single point of the game. There are several different possibilities in earning xp which is shared fairly between people taking part of an event and thats really great. So no more stealing kills/xp from other players, as it seems. Respawns are fast enough and that adds good extra fun to the game too. I also really liked stuff like the hunting log  nice to make some xp, discover new places etc. I wish to say there are more things i liked but, to me, there are none.CONSLooking at the races and classes i could choose from there was none i was saying „yes, i really want to play this one“  i made a different experience when playing other games. Also the game world lacks a bit of fancy details and i think it could be way more fantastic  for my very personal taste.The story itself is incredibly flat. There is too much useless talking (too long dialogues), too much running around and the balance between story (talking) and fighting lacks a lot.  At a certain point of the game i would hit a row of video and semi-video sequences that took me  1,5 hours(!) without actually having to do anything! On the other hand I ended up not being able to keep on doing my class or the main quests since i was missing 1-2 levels. So i had to run around, find something/anything to do and perform the same things (like F.A.T.E.‘s) over and over again til i got even more bored by doing that.I had to turn off the music because i got very annoyed by it after only 2-3 hours of game play (so there‘s a big minus for the soundtrack whose job should be to add some unique extra atmosphere to a game).The fight system is very simple (a few spells, with common effects you would find in any other rpg) and you end up performing the same two/three actions for hours and hours and hours.The game-studio does not seem to have lots of experience with a game like that and it might take them  some more time to be able to offer its customers a proper support (i was, for example, in queue for help chat for over three hours(!), when i was told that there is nobody available for me and just got kicked out). I made this game run after performing three hours of trouble shooting, finding help in some of the forums to finally make it work.The game is very young. I think it has some potential to be a good MMORPG in maybe 1+ years. But i play games for a cool, nice, exciting  story, an atmospheric soundtrack, a good balance between talking and fighting, a nice fighting system  i did not find it here. So i will, as many others,  go and search somewhere else.",zimtschnecke81

First all of those systems? They don't tell you how any of them work. I was leveling up armor trying to figure out why my armor skills weren't increasing. HadI should have known better than to buy this game. I'm not generally a fan of Capcom's oeuvre, but the avalanche of great reviews convinced me, since I love ARPGs with lots of systems. So what's my problem with this game? Two things. First all of those systems? They don't tell you how any of them work. I was leveling up armor trying to figure out why my armor skills weren't increasing. Had to go to Youtube to find out that it's not about leveling your armor but having multiple pieces of gear with the same skill. There's no good explanation for why you need to eat, just do it. It took me forever to figure out how to craft a trap. As a new player to the franchise this was just stupidly frustrating.The second thing that turned me off is the combat. I don't know who designed the combat mechanics, but I would like to so that I can avoid any games they work on from here until the end of time. The process for taking down a monster is pretty straightforward. Track them down, engage, dodge until you get an opening, attack in the opening, dodge back out. This should be fun, but it's marred by controls that take an absolute age to do anything. Melee weapons require you to be so close to the monster that you literally can't see your own character at times, let alone what the monster is doing. For a game that is predicated on reading the tells of the monster, it makes it ridiculously hard to do that while your in the midst of thwacking away at it. The camera also doesn't seem to have a way to lock to a target. I found myself constantly having to fiddle with the camera IN THE MIDDLE OF COMBAT JUST TO SEE THE MONSTER. Add to that that all of your action items are on a quick select menu and that to use them you have to put your weapon away and then wait for a ridiculously long animation to finish before the effect takes place. Down on health and going for that potion? You'll most likely be dead during the animation as the monster stomps you and you get none of the healing effects. The combat is just a pile of frustrating mechanics stacked on top of each other. Did I mention that each monster is going to take between 10-45 minutes to kill? And this is what you'll be doing for most of the game.Lastly I want to mention the phenomenally stupid decisions around multiplayer. There is no easy way to group up and do quests. You have to jump through a stupid number of hoops to play with your friends. If you haven't discovered a monster before, you can't group up with others to go hunt it. For a game that is supposed to be all about teaming up to kill monsters, they make it extremely hard to do so.I wanted to like this game. It seemed interesting and different from other ones I have played in the past. But I cannot get past the enormously frustrating lack of guidance and incredibly slow combat. If I could return it, I would, but I bought it digital, so I'll have to just deal. Lesson learned to listen to my instincts if I think I'm not going to like a game.",grumpyimp23

There was one part that dragged on too long -- come on game, I'm sick of this boss-fight area, lets move on-- but other than that the way they build on mechanics is better than any platformer I've played, and the game only outright tells you how to use the main two mechanics: jumping and dashing. Every single other mechanic is shown through clever gameplay and really good artAnd I haven't gotten to any of the post-game stuff yet, apparently there are something like 3 versions of every level (each level is 1-2hr long), there are 7 levels (plus a bonus) PLUS a ton of collectibles I haven't found yetThe only thing I want in this game that isnt there is a way to save without quitting (no idea why this isnt an option), though the autosave does a good job of keeping upOh also the pacing in the level design is practically perfect, besides that one boss thing, and the adaptive soundtrack fits the mood of each part of each level perfectlybuythisgame9.95/10 -- this game is an absolute joy to play, and a showcase of bringing all great aspects of game design together into a complete package.P.S.

I'm an old school Final Fantasy fan and loved the older games from them. This, however, is an abomination.Fast forward 5 years since its release to the new version which I decided to play out of sheer boredom. It's still just as terrible. Not sure what they meant by ""rebuilding the game from the ground up"" because it is literally the same awful game we all played and walked away from 5 years ago.I'm an MMO vet, dating back to the mid-90s. I've played/beta tested pretty much every MMO worth mentioning. Let me just say that there is little to no improvement over the last version. First off, the game starts out by making you do the most mundane quests imaginable in the starter city. You are literally BEGGING for excitement at some point. Nevertheless, you will keep playing because you think ""surely it will get better"". Nope. It actually gets worse.The UI/HUD is a nightmare. Why you need so many options is beyond me. Second, you need a magnifying glass to read anything, even on my 55"" big screen. Oh, and the map?! Useless. Plus it's microscopic and can't be made fullscreen...Combat is just as bad. No fluidity. No fun. Just the worst.I wanted to like this game. I really did. But the fact is, it's a waste of time. SE has no idea what they are doing in the MMO realm and should have just cashed in when they had the chance. How this game got any positive reviews is amazing to me. Paid reviews are the only answer here, as you can clearly see in the difference between REAL user reviews and the obviously fake ones. Anyone rating this game higher than a 5 or a 6 is a paid reviewer I promise.Anyway, this is a cash grab and a mediocre attempt at making back some of the money they lost during the first release. Nothing much has changed at all. It's still awful, just has a different name (sort of).No voice acting either, so I hope you like reading tiny text for hours on end. Immersion? Yeah right. Unless you are referring to being immersed in failure, in which case Square Enix has that in spades. Can you hear me all the way back there in 1996? This game will take you there I promise.Now mind you, I WANT to say something positive here. I'm not the kind of guy who writes purely bad reviews. But to be perfectly honest, it's mediocre in every area. Literally EVERY area. Don't waste your time or money. I would return it, but I bought the digital download.

It really hold my attention for months, with it's brilliant level design, magnificent orchestrated soundtrack, fast-paced gameplay and beautiful art direction.I never wanted to play a souls game because I'm not a defensive shield and sword type of player, and Boodborne brings the opposite of that, as it rewards you when you play fast and aggressive, and gets you killed when you get too defensive. Most players will need some time to adapt as it has a very specific concept of gameplay, with no mini-map, few checkpoints, and the way you are most of the time totally clueless about what is going on, combined with it's hardcore battle system in which a simple mistake can and will get you killed. But the difficulty works in a way that every progression feels like a real achievement. It's challenging, but not over-challenging in a boring ""can't progress in the story"" way.Another great point for me was the aesthetics chosen, pretty much different from the medieval design of Dark Souls. Bloodborne's visual concept draws influence from Victorian Age gothic horror, and HP Lovecraft's cosmic horror. The game feels a lot like a nightmare, with its city of dark alleys and impossible architecture. Most of the time you don't know where the enemies are hiding and it compels you to pay attention to the environment which is great because the art direction is really beautiful and the level design is made in a way you easily memorize your path through the areas.Definitely a must have if you're into this specific kind of game, which will not please everyone.The DLC ""The Old Hunters"" is amazing, and brings a lot to the game in therms of possibilities, lore and challenge.",BrunoZibordi

I find it exceptional that someone could buy and play the first Mass Effect, determine that they hated it, and then buy into hype and purchase the second game thinking that they would suddenly reinvent the series. Why wouldn't they, I mean, they only planned a 3 game trilogy... why stick to a tried and true method for the sake of storytelling cohesion? The first game had its flaws, which have been covered over and over so I'll just leave that for the writers at 1Up to bring up, but, who would think that this game would NOT have any flaws? Of course they can make an absolutely perfect game with no bugs which everyone and their sister will love and which will cater to all preconceived notions and desires! Why couldn't they? Pushing the present limitations on a 6 year old gaming system with an incredibly large playing universe and a user reactionary story-arc simply is no reason to expect anything than utter perfection!

Yeah it's here and the modern shooter war has well begun. Garneshing a ""3.2"" on metacritic is ridiculous when it has an 89 from certified critics. Sounds crazy doesn't it? That's because Modern Warfare 3 is a good game. While it's definetely no revolution and is pretty much the same game as MW2, 3 distinguishes itself by rising above the beligirent nonsense that was started with Black Ops my least favorite Call of Duty. Modern Warfare 3 is a triumph in this matter, as it smartly chooses to go back to MW2's multiplayer system, one that feels still fun and enjoyable. What however, is the greatest part of this game? It's just pure fun. Whether your playing the great new survival mode that's clocking in my time or the multiplayer, which is the absolute best its ever been, there's so much to keep you interested in Modern Warfare 3 it would be blasphemy to say different. The multiplayer, the crowning achievement of MW3 is exactly what it set out to be, tweaked awesomeness, changing how unlocking guns work with new ""gun ranks"", and new playlists like ""Kill Confirmed"" help keep variety flowing in the game's veins. The single player campaign is actually quite good, while very short, the game still offers up the same hollywood style set pieces and epicness the series has been known for, and offers an ending that wraps up almost everything. Spec Ops however is my favorite thing about MW3. The new survival mode is amazing fun and addictive. The only huge problems are the lack of new graphical content which is enraging many players and should. The game is still running on the CoD4 engine, one that has met its age, and shows it. The only other problems I have are with the story, and I won't spoil any of those, so in the end, Modern Warfare 3 is no revolution, but its a damn fun game, and I don't think I need to say why. 8/10Single Player: Modern Warfare 3Multiplayer: Battlefield 3",ReviewerMan44

This is an mp only game that doesn’t deliver mp elements all that well. Games are regularly stacked, so one team is always crushing the other.  And lobbies don’t shuffle players. So the imbalances will last until the losing players leave (which they will). Respawn is working on a fix. But it’s already too late. Anticheat was missing at launch, which is inexcusable. Titanfall is not a next gen game. It’s a decent shooter, not a ground breaker. And I’m tired of games having to be fixed weeks/months after launch. By the time Titanfall is patched up, I will have moved on to the next shooter. If you have $60 to spare, this is still a worthy title to own. But the lack of content leaves me scratching my head.  Why can’t EA simply launch a game with everything intact? I think many players will leave before the Titanfall project matures. That’s understandable with a game that squandered so much potential. The following is my original review with a few tweaks.Overall, Titanfall isn't a bad game. I'm impressed with its smooth launch. But Titanfall has several mech-sized flaws. Foremost, the game is huge at 50gb; and nearly 35gb's of that are just sound files. For all that heft, the visuals and sound don't really blow me away. The textures are bland and random pop ups plague the environments. In fact, the game looks merely average. Despite the average graphical fidelity, the game will require most machines to work extra hard to pump out max graphics. COD Ghosts is huge as well, and it doesn't look great either. I hate to say it, but Titanfall doesn't look like a next gen game. But it's certainly a resource hog. And considering many PC gamers will install it on expensive (and limited capacity) SSD drives, a 50gb game is nuts.Next flaw: the game modes are little boring. The ""campaign"" is a series of team death match rounds with a half-baked, forgettable story. There are a handful of other game modes, but not the variety you'll see in Black Ops 2 or Insurgency. Respawn may add more game modes, but that's a big if. I think the developers where hoping that players would be blown away by giant mechs and parkour combat. It's fluid, but Crysis and Mirror's Edge still deliver the best parkour experiences to date.The maps are large enough, but I'm surprised by the complete lack of destructibility. Giant mechs running around and they can't overturn a car or shipping crate. This absence is extremely disappointing for a next gen game. Environmental chaos would have given Titanfall a tremendous edge and probably allow it to put BF4 and Ghosts to rest. Without destructive power, the Titan's are nothing more than metal suits with big guns. And that absence is so obvious I'm left wondering why Respawn left it out. So what if a pilot can jump high? I would have more fun punching thru walls and kicking trucks on my opponents while trudging around in a Titan.And obviously, the lack of skill based matchmaking and anticheat is a huge knock against Titanfall. Is this another example of EA pushing games out the door too soon? Or are the developers at Respawn that clueless?So what's good about the game? It runs smooth. Titanfall easily puts BF4 and Ghosts to shame. BF4 is still buggy months after launch, whereas I put 10 hours on Titanfall with only one crash. Titanfall also offers in game voice chat. So players won’t have to find third party alternatives. Considering all the baddies running around, I'm hoping more players will use chat. The gunplay is tight. The hit detection is darn accurate too. In fact, it’s impressive. But weapon balance is merely OK. One hit melee kills, powerful shotguns, and auto lock pistols rankle nerves. Most players run with the same 3 guns. Much like COD. And the guns lack punch. Crysis 3 offered better weapon selection/upgrades that felt powerful. Finally, everyone gets a Titan! No building up a killstreak to drop a Titan. You get one simply by playing. This is a welcome divergence from COD's camp and build your killstreak formula. This should encourage players to move about more since death won't prevent them from hopping into their mechs.Final verdict. The game delivers a bigger rush than COD or Battlefield. Titans and random AI controlled grunts running around really pump up the pace. Additionally, I think many gamers will agree that BF4 and COD Ghosts are disappointing. Titanfall changes the formula enough while delivering gameplay we’re all familiar with. I agree that the game is a too streamlined, but it’s certainly fun to play. Titanfall trims the fat off shooters, a risky move. But despite its high production values, Respawn didn't quite deliver the game we hoped it would. The graphics are surprisingly average. The gunplay is tight, but boring. And the static, indestructible, environments are hard to process when piloting a walking tank. On the upside, the game runs smoothly. It's a blast to play. Controls are fluid and the parkour elements are easy enough to master.",captainkane

250543,The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena,Xbox360,7,"I got this game recently in the bargain bin at a mere $12.00, and I must say that for a measly $12.00, this game was highly worth the purchase.

I averaged for the final score, with me giving Butcher Bay an 8 and Dark Athena a 6. Butcher Bay is clearly the superior game, showing how the Riddick series is supposed to be played, while Dark Athena seems like it began to cave into the modern shooters where the majority of the campaign relies on you running and gunning. But that's not bad, it's just that Dark Athena doesn't have very tight gunplay, resulting in many irritating deaths that were not your fault in the slightest. Butcher Bay is appropriate to start with, since it's first in the series. The environments never get old, ranging from old prison areas to futuristic cryochambers. Your primary means of combat is using a melee weapon or your fists, and stealth. If you cannot master the melee combat mixed in with proper tactical sense, you won't beat the game. My friend found it an extremely difficult learning curve, coupled with some glitchy points in the game where unless you have pinpoint stealth, an enemy soldier will spy you 50 yards away hiding in the shadows behind boxes. The mechanics usually work, but many of the situations require you to think extremely strategically, resulting in gamers being shyed away. Voice acting is also great, and the NPC's throughout the game are extremely believable and hilarious. The game is constantly throwing you new curves, like fighting to the death in prison fights against guards. There's not much help when you encounter boss fights later on, so you might find yourself stuck at some parts without knowing how to kill an enemy. Hint: shoot him in the back. Overall, glitches aside, Butcher Bay is a treat to play.  Dark Athena's story wasn't as engrossing as Butcher Bay, even if they are similar concepts. The voice acting in both games is excellent, and Vin Diesel definitely does a fantastic job playing Riddick. I felt that in Dark Athena, stealth was entirely thrown out the window after the first hour, and instead your left facing overwhelming numbers of enemies with an assault rifle that is sometimes utterly inaccurate. I found myself missing entire clips while the crosshairs were on my target, all because the bullet spray decided it didn't want to kill the enemy drone. The guns are only in the game to serve the purpose of having a gun. Example: the name of the shotgun is Shotgun, the name of the pistol is Gun (I'm not even joking either), and the name of the assault rifle is Assault Rifle. There are a few exceptions, but these are few and far between. Boss fights are a little on the stale side, consisting of the same robots you face in Butcher Bay, but larger and more difficult. Graphics are excellent and the lighting is very good. However, it's the exact same controls, even the same HUD as in Butcher Bay, so in reality it may as well be an expansion pack. The game's multiplayer has no one on it, so I cannot comment about that. In conclusion, Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena pack is definitely a great deal, consisting of two full-fledged games that are both enjoyable, with the first one being superior. If you dislike learning curves and prefer a run-n-gun shooter, than this is not for you. If you desire a stealth-oriented game that has a great story, great mechanics, and great graphics, than I would definitely pick this up, especially since it's now in the bargain bin for such a small fee.",msherry9

There is a number of bags and glitches.Also I found the singelplayer very linear, You cant go to a random vehicle  and speaking of witch there is barely missions that include vehicles but the big thing that I was disappointed is exploration, sure this is after all a Third person shooter however I wish Dice had let us to explore this amazing game wich brings me to another thing. The good thing that everybody and I mean EVERYBODY WILL AGREE (even the call of duy fans) is that the graphcis are the best we seen so far (yes even better than crysis 2 and rage).another thing to say is that the sound of this game is stunning, Any gun fire, massive explosions and bullets that past your head sounds and almust feels  like the real thing wich is give that realistic feel that you're going to a real war. As I say from the start the real deal is the multiplayer wich is by far the best multiplayer you can find on the market and heres 5 reasons why:  1.Exploration- Unlike the singelplayer you can explore alot of stuff in battlefield 3 multiplayer wich is a big suprise, Exploration can help you for your strategy and sometimes its just fun to find some weird easter egg.2.Background- There is nothing like seen a burning city at night when everybody just shooting at each other or seen a deserts, water,trees and anything that mother nature created, also the lighting of this game looks like the real thing.3.Diffrent ways to play-  In battlefield 3 you dont have to be a pro or even average player to win points on this game for example lets just say you are not a great shooter player and you choose the medic, you can use the medic kit and help people that have low health or even revive your teammates.4.Strategy- Battlefield 3 us the latest frostbite version wich is mean that wells, windowns and even buildings can break  or even fall down so you need to think fast wich making the game more strategic, Now you cant camp for about a hour you need to keep moving and bulid a strategy while playing the game. this game really test your skills and even your brain.5. Spawns- The special thing about spawning in battlefield 3 is that you can spawn at your group that you join in the game, the material makes it much more fun but be careful if your team is in no win situation dont spawn and kill yourself, also if you find a jet, tank or any vehicle you can spawn on the base.

DS2 also handles zero gravity in a far more intuitive, and enjoyable way, with none of the crazy hopping from one surface to another as in the first game. Now you can move freely, as you would expect. Also improved in DS2 is Isaac’s level of interaction. Now he speaks! This actually improves the experience more than might be expected, as it gives a greater sense that you’re involved in an unfolding story. The graphics are above average quality though not outstanding. The gameplay is improved by the introduction of more varied environments (although this is still very much a corridor shooter), and there are still plenty of tense moments when battling with enemies, some of which will be familiar if you played DS1, and some of which are new. When compared with the original DS2 is basically more of the same but with a number of welcome improvements and enhcncements. On a final note: I found it a little easier than the first, but that might be because of the improved controls and my familiarity with the gameplay second time around.

55094,The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Wii,3,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        When I was six years old I got an N64 and OoT for my birthday... to put it lightly I have a major fan of the The Legend of Zelda games since. To be blunt I was not impressed by SS. Peope have said that we who are negative of SS are blinded by our nostagla from past Zelda games, to that I agree to an extent. The Zelda franchise has been a constantly evolving series, that has change many core gameplay mechanics, but stayed true to what Zelda has always been about; adventuring the lands, finding badass items, wicked boss fights, and a deep and convaluted story that grips you and pulls you in from start to finish. Pre-N64 games aside, OoT (ALttP was fantasic for its time as well) achieved all of these elements with a high degree for its time becoming one of the first great 3D adventures. It is now the model to which all of us hardcore ""Zelda fanatics"" hold all future installments to. SS is a paradox, despite being hailed as the greatest Zelda game ever, it is a major step back from the progress made since OoT. Each game brings its own special flavour to the medley, and despite never being ""perfect"" they represent progress for the franchise. SS throws away many successful and exhilarating aspects of past games, for new greener ideas. I cannot fault Nintendo for this, for without innovation the franchise wouldn't be in the same place as it is today. Nevertheless, I dearly miss the open worlds of WW and to an extent TP, interesting races like the Gorons or Zoras, the epic boss battles that *ALWAYS* required the unique item from the given temple, and finally... you can quote me on this, ""a complelling story"". As a self rebuttle I did greatly enjoy the new crafting system, the development of many secondary characters on Skyloft, and the new  puzzles using the Wii MotionPlus. These are keepers in the Zelda franchise as far as I'm concerned, although the sword fighting with MotionPlus was at times...infuriating. Despite this the things that made LoZ so special to me, are spat on and frankly thrown out the window as far as I'm concerned for the following 3 reasons:1. Adventuring: Essentially none existent - 3 seperated linear areas, and a large sky that apart from skyloft has very little to offer. In WW there was a wide open world to explore that was deeply interconnected and possible to travel at anytime, even if some islands secrets were item specific. Even the original OoT was open, and Hyrule could be travelled freely other than a free choice exceptions. The main complaint is that the progress that was made in WW and not so much in TP towards a more open and interactive world was not existent in SS.2. Boss Fights: Just Awful - Apart from  Koloktos, the huge beast with 6 arms (who was a blast to fight I should say), and Demise, the rest get to big thumbs dowm. Ghirahim is a huge pain to fight not to mention that you battle him 3 times instead of a boss that is unique to the temple, and the rest are fairly lame. One of my favourite part of the past games was the massive boss fights and how satisfying they always were. Its not a matter of difficulty, but how satisfying it is to slay a massive beast...SS misses the mark in this category.3. Story: Weak - this is a very subjective category I admit, but its been said before and I'll say it again...the story of SS is awful with numerous plot holes. For one who the bloody f*** is Ghirahim! yes he is the demon lord pledged to Demise, but come on! no detailed reasons for his motives, what makes him demon lord? where does he come from? In TP there was a great backstory on Zant, his background is blurry, but it is obvious he is usurping Minda as Ganondorfs pawn and is conquering the world of light. Its easy to work out that Demise has the evil, destroy everything that is fresh and sweet goal, but some more to go on would be nice espeically for Ghirahim. In every Zelda game I've been absolutely captured by the story, with SS I could barely finish the game! I don't even wanna start with Fi...in summary I would have sold my first born child to get one chance to strangle her! To sum up, weak secondary characters, terrible races (the kwikis...come on...), far to linear and repetative plot, and most importantly a lack of connection with the world depicted in SS. I want to jump in to the world's created in Zelda! if you don't feel involved in the plight of the world why bother saving it?Skyward Sword is a step forward for the Zelda francise in terms of controls, and systems, but 2 steps back for the key elements that any Zelda fan should sit anxiously at the edge of their seat for. SS represents a new era for the Zelda franchise, I may not like it but the 93/100 speaks for itself. Old schoolers like myself may be sidelined as Zelda moves into new, uncharted waters disregarding past innovations. I can only hope that LoZ can move forward while respecting the past by bringing about positive change, while staying true to its roots!",frostedblakes

Some players have commented that this illustrates the meaninglessness of materialistic pursuit (i.e. the american gangster dream is pointless, kids). But then why didn't Rockstar shove the fun sandbox content into earlier parts of the game, and made an optional part that 'unlocked' the meaninglessness? It's like GTA IV doesn't reach a point where its map gets utilized in a very satisfying way.The online part was surprisingly still quite active. I give an extra point for that. I got an idea for a future game, wherein players could create their own maps ""inside"" skyscrapers. Like obstacle courses for other players, shooting ranges and various missions.

This is probably the most complete arcady style rally game that I've played ever and it's amazing that the game was launched in  2011.The graphics are completely amazing. Ofc we can spot bad textures here and there, but most of the time everything is in place. Weather effects, lights, day and night tracks, snowy tracks. It's impressive I have to say.Every car has his own sound and we can clearly suspect the amount of horsepower that each one has. It's different to drive a Mini from the 60's, or a B group car from the 90's.2 – GAMEPLAYYou start with a 4 years contract and that’s it. You have then to start grinding reputation for new teams offers, and points so you can access new events.The reputation system becomes annoying since one of the offers is always way better than the others, so you tend to choose that over all the other and, with that, you will not experience most of the cars available. And there are a lot of available cars... believe me, a lot!There's so many content in the game that I'm afraid I forget some of it. We have several disciplines:Traditional rally;Rallycross;Trailblazer (a rally with much more powerful cars);Landrush (rallycross with trucks or buggies);Head 2 Head (most of the time is the event final);Gymkana (where you test your skills performing several tricks).So and what about the gameplay? The game can offer a lot, but if it handles bad it isn't worth it. Fortunately it handles quite well. It's not a perfect simulator. It has a lot of an arcade feeling, but the driving is still accurate and precise, just not unforgiven.You can choose from a lot of difficulty levels of the AI, and you can choose the level of assists that you want. I found medium level to be adequate to my level of driving.With the flashback system you can go back in time and make that perfect corner that you've missed. You can only do that 5 times per race. It's more than enough.I have a big issue with the game. The massive loading screens. We have a lot of those, and they take a lot of time to go, so that take away some of the immersion, and I do not like that.3 – CONCLUSIONI've had so much fun with this game... I play with a controller and it was more than enough for me. I do not know why you cannot find this game on Steam anymore, but if you find it somewhere just get it. I think I got it for free during some giveaway, I do not know where. Well worth it! Great game.",Melgacius

This game is more along the lines of those two, offering much more freedom than the standard MSG formula of moving through a room and watching a 30 minute cutscene followedI'll have to say that this game does feel like more of a Metal Gear Spinoff that a true Metal Gear game. However, that's great for me, because my 2 favorite in the series were Peacewalker (the remake for ps3) and MGS3. This game is more along the lines of those two, offering much more freedom than the standard MSG formula of moving through a room and watching a 30 minute cutscene followed by a 15 minute codec conversation. Don't get me wrong, all MGS games have been stellar, but I found MGS4 and 2 to be the worst as it offered the most limited gameplay and terribly long cutscenes.That being said, for 60$ or less depending on when you get it, the bang for your buck is astounding. Go on missions, free roam, or do side ops while building up your base, with an option to further things with the online portion which is also pretty robust. The story is fleshed out with long casette tape recordings so if you want in on it, play the tapes. Or don't, it's up to you. I love the freedom. After completing about a 2 hour session of missions and free roaming (extracting specialists for my base and scrouging for precious supplies) I sat and listened to  a few tapes on the way back to Mother Base to fill in the story a bit. Everything you do in the field has an impact on your base and while the world is a little sparse, it's really all about infiltrating outposts and finding stuff to extract and build your resources. The amount of weapon variations and gadgets is huge and once you start cruising with R&D you won't even know what to do with all the possibilities at hand. Also, having buddies come with you on missions to build trust is also essential and really enhances the gameplay. Any hey, if you don't feel like stealthing it and just want to blow **** up, you can do that too. The controls are as tight as any game I've played on new gen thus far, so you can shoot it out with high caliber weapons if you so desire. Or go ahead and call in that support chopper to rain hell as you sit back and enjoy the view from a hilltop with your horse.Gameplay is emergent and things happen that you would not expect. You can do things that seem logical and they work, like shining a flash light at a guard with night vision which will blind them. Leave an unconscious guard on a bed and no one will notice, or they stop and complain that they are lazy, lol. I recently had an incident where I deeply infiltrated a base to extract a specialist, but as I pick him up to carry him out I was spotted. I booked up a cliff under heavy fire I noticed he got clipped a couple of times by his buddies. I thought nothing of it, except that when I tried to extract him out he was dead, lol. That sucks but at least it makes sense. Stuff like this that you don't expect frequently happens during gameplay. For instance, guards can clearly see you from a long distance during the day, but they have rely on spotlights and flashlights at night, so doing missions in the dark is logically much easier. Other times they will shoot flares out in an effort to spot you. Simply put, things feel natural and if you think you can do it, you probably can actually. If you put on green camo, you hide better in tall green grass. Put on the yellow camo and you hide better in the desert. It makes sense and the game doesn't need to explain it to you.The one thing that detracts from all this though is the addition of boundaries at certain places. You can climb a cliff as long there is a crack, but sometimes you can't traverse up a 5 foot high stone for instance. It's kind of distracting when it happens. Another thing, for some reason soldiers sometimes act really dumb and I'm wondering if they don't all have there own hidden skill levels. Every once in a while you will see them make some stupid decisions. Also, sneaking around in a box has always been ludicrous, but it's a staple of series at this point but I choose not to use it too much. I guess no game is perfect, but overall gameplay wise this might be the deepest game I've come across yet.Tell ya what, if you liked Peacewalker just get the game and you won't regret. The lack of major cutscenes in the game is a little jarring if your a fan of MGS4, but otherwise the game is superb. It's not like there are no cutscenes, it's just that they are not as developed and snake barely says anything in them.My one ohter disappointment is that there a clear lack of boss battles like some of the legendary ones in games past. Those were the highlights of previous games but they are almost non-existent here or are completely underwhelming. You won't any find battles like the one against Psycho mantis or The end,etc. So I have to knock the game down a notch to 9 because of that, but hey it's already got plenty of straight 10s",MaximumD

Good things, if you like old arcades, quick direct funny games, you’ll find quite a bit of that in this one and that is a good thing. Also, the game play is great, simple but very well implemented and the controls are very very good, you really feel in control of the ship, not frustrating at all. So basically, I’d say the strongest point of this game is its gameplay, it is funny to play (and unfortunately not so many games can say that today).Bad things, lacks story and background info to explain its universe. I don’t think this is a completely bad thing, this game feels a bit like a classic and a lot of great classic games don’t really have a great script behind them. But at the same time can be frustrating for other people, so just be aware you won’t find an interesting story behind this game. The other main bad thing is that is feels awfully repetitive. As I said the gameplay is really good, but the missions all feel the same, really similar objectives and, for me this is worse, almost identical stages in terms of the art and how they are. So, for example, all stages are always maze like structures, and these structures don’t vary a lot in terms of how they look. I mean, for instance, in season one, it’s always inside an asteroid and season 2 is always inside space hulks. It lacks life and the settings are not memorable at all; you want all season 1 missions to be inside asteroids?, fine no problem, but make those asteroids a bit different. For example, one can be the typical rocky type asteroid, another one can have crystal like structures, another one can have massive plant life, and next one can have some kind of ancient civilisation structure inside and that can also slightly affect the gamplay (e.g. find traps in the ancient civilisation structures). I mean, the asteroid concept accepts variability but unfortunately they didn’t think of that (or they didn’t have budget, could also be that). Anyway, summarising that lack of, let’s say, life on the settings plus not a lot on variation in mission objectives makes the game feel a bit repetitive after a few hours…and in my opinion, ruins the experience a bit.Still quite a bit of things to enjoy about this game, I just felt a bit disappointed as I think it could have been a great game and it is just good (in the more strict meaning of the word). Did try it for “free” with PSN plus but, now that I know how it is, I wouldn’t mind to have paid a few quid for this. By the way, this isn’t good or bad and is highly subjective, but I don’t think this game is too hard as some people do suggest, nor too easy either, sits in the middle in my opinion.",stamito

Bungie tried to apply an open world to the Halo series, but failed miserably. As the cookie cutter protagonist that is the Rookie (promising young rookie, never speaks, where have we seen this before? Oh, yea: EVERYWHERE), you travel the bleak, depressing city of a destroyed New Mombasa. There is WAY too much walking, and to top it off, the scenery is bland and uninspired. Everything looks the same in New Mombasa, and worst of all, there are few fights in between objectives, and when you do enter a fight, it's so small and easy that it's nothing worth remembering. The Rookie is trying to find his squadmates who dropped into New Mombasa as well. Upon discovering their remains, you enter standard linear Halo levels, playing as the character you discover up until their crash. This concept seems to be the only thing original about this game. The linear Halo levels aren't completely terrible, but it's nothing worth remembering. The graphics in the game are the same as those in Halo 3, which is a 2007 game. This game came out in 2009. It seems like Bungie just added a bit of blur, but no major polish. Firefight is also boring. A lot of people seem to love it, but I absolutely hate it. The regular multiplayer is fun, but it's Halo 3's multiplayer with every map pack, so I can't credit any of that to ODST. People may tell you that this game is an expansion, but it's not. If it is the same price as a full game, then guess what? It's a full game. If I were you, I'd wait until this game dropped to $30-$40. Otherwise, it's cheaper to buy Halo 3 and every map pack separately, and will definitely leave you with a better experience.",JackS

Unfortunately this is very far from the case. This new NFS:MW is probably the most disappointing game I have played in a long time. It borrows only at a very high level from the above two franchises (Police chases from the former, open world layout of the latter) but fails to implement any of the sense of fun or progression that exist in either of those (superior) titles.I'm sure in multi-player this game starts to make sense, but this is also its undoing. It comes across as a game world designed wholly for you to race around with your on-line friends but with absolutely no content for off-line players (bar smashing billboards lifted straight from Burnout Paradise), think Quake:Arena off-line appeal as a point of reference.Whilst the graphics and frame rate are excellent, the handling and AI is truly appalling. None of the cars have a natural weight or feel to them and all feel like they have four flat tires, such is the waywardness of their handling. Slightly squiffy handling can be overlooked if the game still manages to be fun (this was the case with Burnout Paradise), but even here NFS:MW fails on this basic requirement. The game just feels aimless with no sense of point or progression. There is no story, just a leaderboard of faceless ""Most Wanted"" drivers to beat. If you're coming to this game with fond memories of the (intentionally) cheesy rival cut-scenes from the original NFS:MW then you are in for a major disappointment here.Probably the biggest crime (ironic, considering the title!) this game commits is the removal of car ownership! Yes that's right, this is probably the only racing game where you don't get to build your own virtual garage of bought / won cars. Sometimes trying something new is the way to reinvigorating a tired genre, but there is a reason why no-one has gone down this route before. If you remove the need to earn money to buy cars (or races where you win cars) then you remove one of the main points for playing a racing game. With the whole game essentially ""unlocked"" right from the beginning, once you've had a little burn around the map and completed a couple of races your quickly find yourself becoming bored. It's like the developers took on board the ""endless grinding"" comments about GT5 and thought ""we'll do the exact opposite of that"", when in fact what is required is a halfway house (as implemented by every other racing game). The fact that the police and competitors fully embrace rubber band physics, even the chases / races aren't very enjoyable.This brings me on to my other complaint of this title, the police chases. They're just not very interesting. In the original NFS:MW you would actively search out police and incite them to chase you because the chases (especially as they ramped up in scale) were truly fun and as enjoyable as the races. This is not the case with this latest incarnation where the police chases just act as an annoyance that get in the way of you racing.Resident Evil 6 was something of a disappointment (mainly due to clunky AI, controls and camera angles and total lack of scares or puzzles) but at least had a sense of fun. This is just not the case with NFS:MW. It's a racing game with dodgy handling, rubber band AI and absolutely no sense of progression, achievement or fun.NFS:MW biggest problem though is that Forza Horizon already does everything (bar the police chases and considering how poorly NFS:MW implemented them this isn't a real issue) that NFS:MW does, but does it much better. Open world environment, CHECK. Fabulous graphics and silky frame rate, CHECK. Wide list of cars both past and present, CHECK. Superb handling that can be tailored to suite, CHECK. Diverse selection of race events, CHECK. On-line racing, CHECK. Ability to purchase / win and customise cars, CHECK.With Forza Horizon the developers have taken all the elements from the best racing games, thrown them into a pot and cooked them up into a lovely tasting concoction that satisfies on (almost) every level. With NFS:MW, Criterion have taken Burnout Paradise, stripped out all the offline content, tacked on police chases and ended up with something very underwhelming.All that's left to say is that with Black OPS 2 out tomorrow, my copy of NFS:MW is going to help fund its purchase. All I'm hoping is that NFS:MW trade in value hasn't been dented too much yet by other disgruntled players.",chanco

There's a load of new achievements as well that require a fair amount of skill to complete which adds another level of depth to the game, let alone the multiplayer.If you liked Portal, this game is worth the 45$ on Steam. If you're paying more than that for the game, then it's your problem for not buying it cheaper. It improves and expands on every aspect of the original. People that are all ruffled over the ARG and Potato Sack need to move along, neither of those should affect the rating of the game itself. As an aside, the ARG was all about generating hype (which it did very well, imo) and the Potato Sack supported a load of indie games at a massive discount that I also felt was well worth it.",Grimnir

The stages are not only the best i've seen in the series, they might be some of the coolest and best i've seen in a action game ever. Whats even more impressive is how great this game looks and its running on such an outdated game engine  unreal 3 ).Audio: The audio is kick ass. However this time is licensed music. Its all perfectly chosen and fit the game perfect. Its a blend of metal, rock and techno depending on the stage. Since its not just game music its actually stuff that you'd probably wanna just listening to for hearing pleasure too.Gameplay: The game plays is awesome. Dante feels more like nero from part 4 in this one with his angelic and demonic grabs working just like neros arm grab. Imho this is fantastic as nero is my favorite DMC play style in the whole series. The game does suffer from some flaws however. Its vastly too easy. You're gonna just instantly wanna start on the hardest difficulty thats available from the start. Another thing it it seems impossible to cancel out of a move mid action.Story: DMC has always had terrible stories. This one at least tries and it does much better than any previous entry. However its still nothing to write home about.Over all this is the best DMC period. I really think people are missing out because they dont like Dantes new look and more ""edgy"" personality.

249280,Dragon Age II,PlayStation3,10,"Dragon Age Origins was a good game. It had an interesting story, interesting characters and quests and good tactics combat. However it suffered from ugly outdated visuals, lack of proper controls for the ps3 (controlling a character with the stick felt very loose and the characters themselves felt weightless), no sense of immediacy (you sent someone to do an action, you didn't do theDragon Age Origins was a good game. It had an interesting story, interesting characters and quests and good tactics combat. However it suffered from ugly outdated visuals, lack of proper controls for the ps3 (controlling a character with the stick felt very loose and the characters themselves felt weightless), no sense of immediacy (you sent someone to do an action, you didn't do the action with the press of a button) and ..tactics combat. I didn't like the strategic tactics combat of the first, it never drew me in and although I have put more than 70 hours in that game it felt like a choir and I only did it for the story. It also suffered from a lot of micromanagement and combined with a bad font type that was just too small for a 40 inch LCD it resulted in sore eyes. In this respect Dragon Age 2 is a major improvement to say the least. This time the game looks good, in fact at times it looks great, the character models are good and detailed, the background is nice, the buildings and castle walls look great. The controls are tight this time, the characters have some weight and although they move fast and swing great swords with much ease, the feel is right. The combat is a lot more action oriented with the immediacy that I mentioned earlier. You hit X and the character lands a blow. This way the combat is a lot more satisfying although tactics fans will disagree. The excessive micromanagement is gone, and the menus are well designed. Overall the game is more streamlined and console friendly but that's not a negative thing for ps3 owners. Also gone are the endless lines of petty dialogue that led nowhere. The conversations now are more to the point and this time thanks to the mass effect wheel it's easy to understand the motions that hide beneath the phrases so you know what to choose.So, to sum things up I would say that DA2 is a more streamlined action RPG game than it's predecessor but without sacrificing depth for looks. The tactics game is still in there for those that prefer it but now it appeals to the action gamer as well. Unless you are a die hard old school RPG player that refuses to accept its changes, you will probably like this game.",teras

244851,Saints Row: The Third,PlayStation3,9,"I usually steer clear of games like this.

I'm not a huge fan of ""gangsta life,"" rarely enjoy sophomoric humor involving pimps and prostitutes, and can't get satisfaction from cop-killing and other criminal activities.  Games areI usually steer clear of games like this.  I tried Saints Row 1&2, and while I could respect them for what they were trying to accomplish, they still fell into the same ""just don't care"" category as GTA.  I'm not a huge fan of ""gangsta life,"" rarely enjoy sophomoric humor involving pimps and prostitutes, and can't get satisfaction from cop-killing and other criminal activities.  Games are an escapist experience for me, and I typically prefer more fantasy or sci-fi inspired settings, and if a game chooses to depict a more realistic modern setting, I will only pay attention to it if the story and themes are highly original.  That being said, Saints Row: The Third doesn't meet any of those deeper, escapist qualities that I mentioned, nor does it depict anything realistic in its loose ""gangsta"" themes.  This third entry takes the series in a new direction, and the result has more in common with Twisted Metal or Just Cause than Grand Theft Auto.  This is the kind of on-screen madness that I can get on-board with.  For someone who is still playing Dark Souls, The Witcher 2, Assassin's Creed: Revelations, and Skyrim, a little stupid fun can go a long way towards cheering me up.  SRTT aims to make you smile, and all of its ridiculous humor makes you realize just how funny games can be when they don't take themselves seriously.  Sure, you still kill cops and blow s*** up constantly, but in SRTT, it all feels so idiotic and over-the-top, that you half-expect the same characters that you chopped up with a chainsaw or threw out of a 40th floor window to get up and laugh it off, followed by another vain attack against your easily overpowered character.  Now, that's not to say that the game is a breeze; it can be quite challenging on the highest of its three difficulty settings.  But it also rewards you for practically everything you do, from near misses in traffic to a chain of headshots, making it an unlikely comparison to games like Elder Scrolls in its open-world RPG elements.  On that note, the character creation and continuous customization rival the best role-playing titles on the market.  You can also upgrade weapons, get vehicles, and purchase property.  It's weird to admit this, but after playing Saints Row: The Third, you start to wonder why more serious RPGs don't incorporate these gameplay components on a consistent basis.  There's no denying that the game is well-constructed, and even though the campaign will only last about 15 hours, it includes enough content to extend play to the 30 or 40-hour mark.  That's not including the countless hours you could spend on multiplayer and other modes, and DLC is already showing up on the network.  In the end, Saints Row: The Third is exactly as advertised - an adult playground with a stupid amount of toys to help you waste time, but you may be surprised by the lasting value you get out of such a mindless experience.  I certainly was.",JPoppaWUSC

The world is rather mysterious, but thanks to the cinematic shorts, comics and other posts, it's actually quite cool for a Shooter. I want to love this game really, really hard.But I can't.First of all, the matchmaking!Blizzard is notorious for their incompetent matchmakers. Heroes of the Storm was a huge failure because of it, despite HOTS having pretty damn awesome gameplay and design, the cancer that was matchmaking proved to be fatal to the game. One would think that the company learned from its mistakes. Nope. The game throws everyone together. Seasoned, highly skilled tryhards who are in it for the win and teamplay, and useless, noobcake newbies who will pick a 3rd sniper to cement your team's failuire. The teams are rarely ever balanced. One team usually stomps the other. Virtually every single game is full of frustration and stress. I tried to cling onto hope so hard that I gave the game more than 50 hours played hoping that the matchmaking will get a bit better, but nope, it didn't. To make things worse, there is no ranked play. Why would any developer release a competitive team based game without ranked play? That's the point of the whole game. It's like, selling a car without a motor: ""Here's your car, we don't have your motor yet, but in the meantime you can sit in it, or you can pretend to dive it!""Did I mention high latency? In most online games I have 20-25 ms ping. In overwatch the lowest I've seen is 40-45, but it usually is 60-70.The server communicates with the clients 20.8 times per second. So, everything you do in the game happens on that other guy's monitor about 0,1 seconds later. That's a lifetime in a fast paced FPS shooter! You will get shot by snipers and everybody all the time despite the fact that you were already in cover on your machine. It's a joke.I played plenty of multiplayer FPS games in my life. I used to be a Quake1 player, touched Q3, Quake Live, the COD and Battlefield series, the UT series and so on, but those games were FUN.

The opening FMV is so engrossing that you will for certain sure watch it at least 10 times; possibly before you even play the game. Ditch your preconceptions. This game uses a level system like nothing you have ever seen. Your strength in combat is determined by the amount of 'stars' you have; you earn stars by playing through plot battles. You cannot powerlevel in this game, nor do you need to, as the experience you gain as you play is all you will need. You still need to fight! Fights reward you with various items, which you can give to a smith who will forge new weapons, armours and accessories for a fee. After you beat a boss battle you can obtain some stat boosts from fighting too. The magic system is also unique, as it relies on Elements. There are several different colours of Element, and these Elements can be of various power levels. There is no 'native' power level for an Element - so long as you have the ability to assign an Element to a power level, you can use any Element at that power level. As in Chrono Trigger, characters can learn 'techs', which can also be double and triple techs. The art and music is sublime. While that all seems disorganised and disparate, think a moment on what the greatest threat to RPGs is. In Final Fantasy 8, it is possible to beat seven shades out of T-Rexaur before you leave Balamb. It is possible to upgrade to second-tier magic before doing so! In Chrono Cross, the restrictive level system makes it more fun and challenging. Your opponents will always be a challenge. The only way of defeating them is through the use of strategy, intelligence and superior armanent.

There has been considerable effort made to make the PC version feel like a proper PC release. PC users can enjoy a variety of options like sun soft shadows, HBAO+, Purehair, and high resolution textures. It needs to be said that this game is very pretty and as such it can be quite demanding.You will need at least 4gb of Vram to use Very High textures. The game also seems to be CPU intensive so folks with older i3's may find some difficulty. You will also want to make sure you have at least 8gb of ram. I run the game on a modest GTX 750 ti with 2gb of GDDR5 vram. I also run the game on an i5 with 8gb of total ram. Due to my vram I had to turn texture resolution down to medium. Prior to the latest patch I experienced some stuttering in certain areas. After the recent patch those instances haven't been as common. I run the game at 1050p so be mindful that it will be difficult to hit 60 fps at 1080 unless you have a high end GPU. Dropping your resolution to 900 or even 720p may yield a higher more consistent frame rate. Load times will also be a bit longer if your using a mechanical drive instead of a SSD. I highly recommend this game if you enjoyed the 2013 reboot. But be mindful of your system specs and that you may need to do a bit of tweaking to get an optimal experience.",Lone_Wolf_Sones

They brought in new guns and perks, gun levels, and gun perks. Those are all very good. But, some of the new guns are extremely over-powered. The game has been sped up to make it better for people who like to rush in. There is very little strategy involved, especially in the modes of Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed. The only strategy there is ""look here, look there, try not to get shot, and kill enemies as fast as possible"". This game is really built for the types of players who want to race to see who can get the best score, the fastest. The last part is what I have a problem with. It also seems like the maps have been made more compact, with shorter ranges of sight requiring faster reactions and higher sensitivities. In addition with the fact that players move more quickly, this makes the game frustratingly fast-paced. It's so sped up, in fact, that the fire-rate on most of the automatic weapons makes it seem like someone hit you once and killed you. This is a step down from the level of Black Ops. It's probably even worse than MW2. I suggest to anyone considering getting this game to take little stock in the ""critics"" who gave this game high scores, and instead listen to the actual players. Instead of this game, get Skyrim, Saints the Third, Battlefield 3, or something else that you find interesting, because this game is not worth a $60 investment.",thelightfang

PURE B.S., TROLLS, and possibly HIRED BY OTHER MMOS TO TRY AND EXPLAIN AWAY THE TITAN THAT IS WOW. SORRY BUT YOU DON'T GET THE CHANCE TO EXPLAIN QUALITY GAMES AWAY, because those of us who actually PLAY it will be here to utterly, and unequivocally, CRUSH your ignorance.This game is HIGH QUALITY from the second you step foot in Draenor, YOU WILL SEE IT FOR YOURSELF.THINK ABOUT IT, what other MMO in the world comes even REMOTELY close in terms of END-GAME CONTENT, let alone CONTENT at all? NONE! I've played them all, NOT A SINGLE ONE comes even REMOTELY close, there is NOTHING out there. Save yourself the trouble of trying all the garbage that these trolls claim is so amazing, and just stick with the real deal, WoW is here to stay, get over it, and get with the program.PROS SO FAR:-Questing is actually diverse, varied & not repetitive (this is a huge plus cause I hate questing)-Beautiful new zones (so far)-Music in this expansion is epic (so far)-Cut-scenes really put the story into perspective, and help introduce new content-Dungeons offer more flexibility of boss order, and are actually pretty varied & fun (so far)-New updated graphics & character models look great, but again I don't play this game for graphics, never have, but the detail & the landscaping is probably the best I've seen.

I'm actually surprised we could do ANYTHING at all, considering how massively popular the launch was. Yes it was extremely laggy, but there were no bugs (unlike what some of these reviewers claim, I did not find any bugs at all, have not had any problems in questing thus far).For people who are stupid enough to think that the number one most popular MMO for 10 years in a row is somehow ""BAD"" or ""DYING,"" think about it logically, it makes no sense BY ANY METRIC WHATSOEVER. Do yourself a favor and ignore those people, and instead, PLAY the game, DECIDE FOR YOURSELF. IF ANYONE is BRAINLESS and a ""SHEEP"" it's the WoW haters, since it makes NO SENSE what they say regarding WoW ""DYING"" or that it's ""BAD,"" it simply is not true, at all, and never has been. So who is a ""SHEEP"" now? I think the answer is clear, if you take the time to think logically about it, you'll find that WoW is #1 for 10 years for a damn good reason, and it's not because of ""SHEEP"".If anything the launch is an indication that WoW is here to stay, and will continue to be the number one most popular MMO by leaps and bounds, there is no contest here, WoW is ahead by millions and it will stay that way for a very long time.FOR THE ALLIANCE.FOR AZEROTH!",Winterlight212

BF3 uses dedicated servers and it shows. But here is the main problem with MW3, there are NO medium to long range maps...90% of the maps are small close quarter street and alley type layouts that have no areas to hold down or go after and really no buildings to go in. They all play the same, just super fast paced with the same perks and guns from before. Forget maps like Wasteland, Terminal, Estate, Derail, Afghan, Carnival, Trailer Park, Overgrown....maps with personality letting you go in planes/airports, C130s, trailer parks, train yards, open areas with long lines of sight, etc. Most maps are single level with a few stairs for multilevel but the line of sight is terrible. Forget sniping. It's useless. EVERY MAP IS LIKE FAVELA IN THE LAYOUT EXCEPT YOU CANNOT GO IN 99% OF THE BUILDINGS. This is a sad rehash of MW2 with HORRENDOUS map design. So for a game that is based off a host connection, all these stupid little street/alley maps will literally make you so mad because someone will kill you before you even have a chance to react.

Come on! - Only the might and growth virtue/policies seem worthwhileReview: I admire the risks taken with this game, and I see a lot of things that I like, as well as things that need refining, and things that should have changed, but didn't. Espionage is much better than before, having been completely reworked into a system where agents cannot access missions above the total ""action limit"" in the city, which increases as successful missions occur, decreasing when your enemy places an agent in the same city. Another positive change is the way higher-tier units are accessed-through the non-essential ""leaves"" which grant ""affinity"" points in the tech web. You could achieve some goals without ever levelling your unit types. Annoyingly, however, the good promotions of the past are ditched in favor of a flat 10% bonus every time the unit levels--the good promotions are now embodied by a choice which affects all units of that type on level up. One thing that was greatly improved, however was the continuing significance of ranged units (which no one built past crossbows unless they had the ""improved range"" perk). This is critical in SMBE because there are fewer unit types and only three factions--you need all the unit diversification you can get. EDIT: There are also unique affinity units which are unlocked at higher affinities (7+) though they are pretty much all land units.Other changes include the nice visual style (even the harshest critics acknowledge it looks different) and the ability to totally ignore techs in the web--I think it would be difficult to finish with every tech like one could before.There are some serious issues, however. The AI still regularly demands trade deals (even when they have poor relations and will reject the deal they suggested) and offers only ""favors"" (although I guess offering anything in return is a new feature). Furthermore, the ""warmonger"" feature is broken--I destroyed one outpost (not a city) and for the rest of the game I was a warmonger to every other player, leading to several 100+ turn cold wars. Speaking of annoying enemy factions, Franco-Iberia seems a bit broken, as they tend to interrupt every turn with a hate message. Wonders are accessed through tech, so it isn't clear why this should be, but it is.Further weaknesses include the further diminished air and navy (if I see these in an expansion I am going to be extremely mad--this better have been an accidental oversight and not a money-maker); and the unbalanced virtues (only might and growth get points when I play, health is poorly addressed by other trees).Basically, there are good and bad things about the game. I like it overall and I will keep playing it (hence the positive score), but Firaxis needs to patch up some holes (including missing/absurdly long unit animations and unit image superposition in the ""specialize unit view"" window) if they want more than just fans to like the game.",dyspeptic

What happened to this series.This game is nothing more than a Dark Souls clone, only it lacks everything that made the Dark Souls series popular in the first place. This over the shoulder camera that makes it impossible to truly judge your footing; causing you to crash into the walls constantly. In Dark Souls, the camera is pulled back so you can see everything in front of your character and just enough behind you that you don't ever feel like you've been hit unfairly. In this game, you are constantly being hit from behind, and it is most certainty the games fault. The arrows around Kratos don't work because the dodge mechanic works only half the time. In the original series the dodging was easy, a simple flick of the right stick and you would roll in that direction. Here you have to hammer on a button three or four times before the game allows you to roll, only to have it fail anyway. What I'm trying to say is, Dark Souls doesn't use cheap mechanics to kill you off, this game does.At the end of the day, this just isn't a God of War game, it's a Dark Souls clone that holds no candle to Dark Souls, and I am not particularity a fan of Dark Souls.",joeshadowman1

Video games were never intended to reach the level of emotional involvement that Chrono Cross did. While Chrono Cross fell victim to being criticized for being too different from Chrono Trigger and not very sequel-like, Cross is ultimately the better game of the two in every single meaningful area, and all of its changes are for the better, unless you were one of the aforementioned people who wanted nothing more than Chrono Trigger 2. What separates Chrono Cross the most from every other game is its skill at evoking emotions in the player. Cross will make you sob like a scolded little girl at the sad scenes and grin like it's your first hit of cocaine at the happy scenes. No other RPG has been able to do this quite like Cross was able to. Possibly the most imaginative game ever created, it will literally take you across time and space to reach one ultimate final point that ties everything together. The ""true"" ending is so mind-blowing and surreal that by the time the end credits and epilogue finish, you'll be sitting feeling like you've changed as a person as a result of what you've experienced. Again, video games were never intended to be this emotionally involving. It just wasn't considered possible. Chrono Cross is easily one of the best if not the best RPGs ever created, as well as one of the best games ever made. The game's biggest drawback is that it does, at some point, end. But it gently takes your hands and helps you up off the floor and shows you a very meaningful New Game+, which is well worth exploring.

Unity and Syndicate both introduced small changes to the AC formula, while keeping the core principal untampered - find your target in a sprawling city, stealth your way to him vertically or horizontally and try your best to assassinate him by stabbing him in the back with your hidden blade, or if push comes to shove, use your assortment of other weapons to dispatch your target(s).Origins takes the core idea and builds around it a larger scope of gameplay variety, while placing it in an open world environment. These are no subtle alterations, nor are they a departure from what makes an Assassin's Creed game an Assassin's Creed experience. Everything is still here, but bigger. Previous titles had upgrade mechanics, while Origins has a skill tree separated into three branches. All three compliment the core gameplay mechanics, thus alloweing the player to mix and match his favorite style of gameplay.The setting for this installment - Ancient Egypt - is probably the most popular historical period in my personal opinion when looking back at the previous games. The world is sprinkled with amazing sights. While exploring, the player can come across a plethora of side activities that are not as cumbersome as in previous games in the series. That is because the development teams at Ubisoft drastically downsized the amout of collectables and opted for a larger emphasis on side quests, where each has its own unique storyline that ties with the main plot.Overall Assassin's Creed Origins is a healthy return to form for the series!

Animations are akward, slow, characters flow weightlessly. Quality of 3D objects wildly varies, as of textures. All in all, IAs backer, I expected a lot from Wasteland 2. But to my dismay, it did not deliver.First off, graphics is poor. Not only it is not artistically pleasing, it is most of the time bland, uninspired, and without trace of atmosphere. Colors don´t work together. Animations are akward, slow, characters flow weightlessly. Quality of 3D objects wildly varies, as of textures. All in all, I really don´t feel visuals deliver the story and overall setting correctly.Level design is pretty bad, outdated, and without attention to detail. For example, there are literally hundreds of chests everywhere, most of them trapped, like what the hell? Who left them there? In the middle of nowhere? Why? Does this make any sense? No, it doesn´t, the world is unbelievable and feels fabricated. On top of that, you´ve got to rotate camera all the time to not miss important stuff. In these regards, even Fallout 1 is way better.I´ve just completed first of the bigger quests and I really wonder whether I should play on, and hope for the better. Because so far, its a drag. Boring NPCs, boring quests, all wrapped in bad visuals.Combat seems kinda ok, although monsters are nothing to write home about. Random generated encounters are really terrible, as there are like two different maps they happen upon. It gets repetetive really quickly. You don´t expect mindless grind in single-player, but, boy, you will get it here.If I compare W2 with recently published Divinity: OS ($1mil.), Wasteland 2 looks like very indie, borderline amateurish, attempt.

This pack blows most other DLC completely out of the water. The characters are a welcome addition, though it would've been nice to see them bring back old favorites like Birdo or Diddy Kong before cloning Mario and Peach yet again. The vehicle selection gets a rather favorable expansion with the addition of the Blue Falcon and the Master Cycle, as well as the return of a fan favorite, the B-Dasher. However, the main draw is the tracks, and I'm going to have to talk about each one individually.Yoshi's Circuit - What a great way to start off the Yoshi Egg Cup? This is a favorite track off mine, partially due to the Yoshi theme, but also due to the twisting and turning this track has you do. You always feel like you're on your toes. Still bummed the secret tunnel isn't back. 9/10Wario's Goldmine - Kicking off the Triforce Cup is a returning track from Mario Kart Wii. This one was one of my favorites. I blame Stockholm Syndrome as this one was a pain to get a good time on, but more importantly, I think they've fixed the one gripe I had with it, and that was how shard one of the mid-track turns always felt. Not sure I like them removing the mine carts as hazards, though. The shortcut now feels like it takes no real skill. 8/10Rainbow Road (SNES) - Kill me now. I can already feel my ears and eyes bleeding. This is the fourth time this track has been featured in a Mario Kart game. We get it. You're proud of it and the nostalgia is brings, but can we just put it to rest for a few... decades? Please? Still a good rendition of the track. 4/10Excitebike Arena - A great original track. This one adds in the interesting mechanic of randomizing every time you play it. Couldn't begin to explain why I like it so much, though. It's just straightaways with two turns each lap, yet I feel like something is always going on in this track. 8/10Dragon Driftway - I actually really love this track. I might be a tad biased as drifting is one of my favorite techniques in Mario Kart, but I really do enjoy playing this track quite a bit. I can see how it could be considered boring, though. 8/10Ice Ice Outpost - Aside from the derpy name, I think this is my favorite track in the whole pack. It may seem very simple and straight forward, but once you start looking for the quickest route, you'll likely find that this is actually a rather difficult course to get the most out of. The short cuts are hard enough to catch, but they're even harder to link together, and that's not counting all the track-switching you'll have to factor in. I also love the feel and the theme. 10/10Hyrule Field - This is a bit of a let down, actually. The fan service is here in spades, but the track, itself, feels a bit dull. Maybe it's just me? This is easily one of my least favorite to race in this pack, but it's still great for all the TLC put into the details. 6/10Mute City - Ending this on a high note. Mute City is fast, furious, dizzying, difficult, and overall very interesting. There's nothing about this track that isn't to love. They even lowered the gravity here to make the track feel more floaty and give you that F-Zero feel, as well as littering the track with boost panels to keep the speed going. Great fan service sprinkled here and there and attention to detail. Not my favorite, but it's always a joy to race on. 9/10This is the way to do DLC. If Pack 2 is anything like Pack 1, I think we'll be seeing a trio of great review scores for this game, sitting pretty near the top of the Wii U games list.",UGXwolf

It is what I consider to still be the best 3-D fighter ever made and well worth buying a Dreamcast just to play. KenshiroKing and I used to play until our thumbs bled and even today we still throw it in occasionally and end up playing for hours on end, all the while marveling at the spectacular combinations and guard impact strings we are able to assemble against each other. Enough reminiscing about Soul Calibur and let?s move onto its sequel. The story begins by me having to spend two hours standing in line waiting on the truck to deliver the game to the GameStop that I had pre-ordered it from. When it finally arrived, I promptly picked up all three versions of the game because each comes with an exclusive character, those damn marketing geniuses. Link of classic Nintendo fame is sick and tired of saving Zelda and decides to check out what the whole fuss is about a Soul Edge for the Gamecube. He comes wielding swords, shields, bombs, boomerangs, bows and sharp sticks. Where?s his hook shot? His tactics are almost as dirty as that Michael Jackson-looking, cheating pirate himself, Cervantes and that pistol-hiding off-hand sword of his. For a good laugh check out Link?s throw from behind the opponent. The Gamecube suffers from a directional pad that is so small that it forces the player to use the analog stick, which as an old skool fighting game player makes me cringe. The button placement is radically different from the Dreamcast, Xbox and PS2 controllers, thus making it a frustrating transition if you?ve learned to play the game on those formats. The buttons have different tensions, which makes it more difficult to pull off the slide button moves (where you slide your thumb from A to B). To make up for this design flaw the controller does provide the right analog stick that performs some of the more difficult to execute button press combinations for the controller with a simple thumb movement, something I would feel dirty using. Having the worst controller ever devised for a fighting game hampers the Gamecube, but the novelty of Link and graphics that are almost on par with the X-box make this version a decent pick. Heihachi Mishima is pissed somebody stole his diaper from Tekken 4 and he journeys to the past to wear Japanese sandals and kick ass on the PS2 version. I have always been a fan of the Sony Playstation Directional pad. They are perfectly suited to a fighting game. The buttons are also less raised when compared to the X-Box?s S-Controller. All this adds up to the PS2 taking the crown as the best controller of the three consoles. The exclusive character is a matter of opinion, but mine is that Heihachi is the worst of the three. The most glaring problem with the PS2 is the occasional slow down that occurs. This is unforgivable in any game let alone a reflex-based fighter. The PS2 graphics processor having preceded its competition by a full year has not aged well. This is shown clearly when comparing the three side-by-side against the X-box and Gamecube iterations. Even with all these problems, the controller is a big factor in the decision to go with this console. Possibly because he shares the same colors (black and green) as the console, the X-box version has Spawn as the exclusive character. He comes sans cape, but with a shit-eating grin as he subtly plugs his upcoming Spawn game made by guess who, Namco. Although Spawn is a positive addition to the game, how many of us would have preferred the Master Chief swinging around a Covenant sword or two and Cortana jumping out and doing some shit talking for him? All of us? Thought so. Nonetheless Spawn, who is agile and high-kicking enough to be given the moniker Ninja Spawn. Although, his range is limited with his axe, he makes up for it with his furious feet and being able to fly about and rain hell fire down on unsuspecting foes. The X-box version comes out swinging with the best graphics and sound (720p HDTV support and Dolby Digital 5.1). It also boasts the second best character and controller of the three. Get this version if you have an HDTV or home audio system. Everybody from Soul Calibur is back in one form or another. Besides the console exclusives, new to the game are also Raphael, a rapier twirling fencer, Talim, a slight tonfa wielding girl, Cassandra, a short-sword and shield specialist and Necrid a Todd McFarlane inspired stealer of other character?s moves. If you played the original Soul Calibur not much will be new to you here and that is the biggest problem with the game. The only real change is in the aesthetics. The enhancements of an overhauled graphics engine, some combat tweaks, a few new characters and new stages do not a sequel make. This game should have been called Soul Calibur 1.5 rather than 2. I mean seriously, could we have at least gotten new weapon demonstrations for fuck?s sake. Speaking of combat tweaks, the characters have an annoying momentary pause right after they get up that was not there before in Soul Calibur. The weapon master mode is the largest means by which to unlock stages, characters, weapons and outfits and that is almost incentive enough to go through it. The process of doing so was as close to torture as I want to ever get. The dungeon crawling fights for some of the missions almost had me turning off the game and forgetting about the unlockables. As a veteran of Soul Calibur, the difficulty was marginal and the computer A.I. is as pathetic as it was in the original. Rather than enjoying my time with the game it just became a matter of sitting there and pounding out the missions. The game really shines in the one on one mode. Soul Calibur 2 should be praised on its great versus game that still conjures up the same feelings as the original. My complaints about the game are silenced once I sit down against a human opponent. With skilled players, the fights become something more and live on in memory as elaborate dances. No other game can do that. That is why this game still kicks the ass of every other fighter out there. ",Riposte101

But let me tell you one thing, persona 5 is a blessing and well worth the delays that people had to endure.Persona 5 takes place in japan and revolves aroundYou very rarely get hyped for YEARS over a game and when it releases it lives up to your expectations. Persona 5 is one of these miracles. Before Persona 5 I had never played a persona game so i wont be able to make comparisons. But let me tell you one thing, persona 5 is a blessing and well worth the delays that people had to endure.Persona 5 takes place in japan and revolves around the protagonist who you can name yourself but he is referred to as Ren or Akira. I will refer to him as Akira for this review. The main plot of persona 5 is complex and hard to describe but  easy enough to understand in game. Akira witnesses a woman being abused in the streets and steps in to help but is convicted of assault himself and placed on probation in tokyo with a distant relative. During a dream the following night his soul ascends into a world between dream and reality and he is told that to save his future and the whole of Japan from ruin he must reform society as a trickster. This is where the fun begins. The game revolves around Akira heading into places called ""palaces"". There is an alternate dimension named the metaverse which is where evil peoples visions come to reality. Only tricksters and persona users can enter this place. To reform evil people you must traverse the palace completing objectives and stealing the treasure or source of the evil desire. In persona 5 you live a double life, in the day you are a regular high school student, studying and wandering Tokyo in your everyday life, at night a phantom thief stealing the hearts of villains. In persona 5 you will gather a crew of people who have really creative designs. Ryuji is a rebellious troublemaker, Anne is a model, Yusuke an artist. The personalities go on but they gel incredibly. As a trickster or a persona user, just like how evil cognitions form in the metaverse, your personality takes a materialised form and you will use this to battle enemy personas or ""shadows"". The battle system is really like no other and is a turn based fighting style, you will have four teammates at any given time and you will take turns either using a gun, primary fire, or a persona move, using persona moves that an enemy is weak to will knock them down leading you on to endless possibilities in the fights. The battle system is the only battle system I have never gotten bored of so you know it's insane. Each palace takes a good 5-10 hours on average to complete each taking different designs and puzzles which adds a great sense of variety. Also the voice acting, persona 5 is one of the few games that actually has a good english dubs, no voice seems out of place and it fits. In the real world you have 5 abiltiies if you like, proficiency, knowledge, kindness, charm and guts. increasing these abilities will unlock new confidants and abilities to use in the metaverse. Confidants are people you have a bond with, hanging out with them in the daytime will increase your bonds and occasionally will give you new items or abilities to help in battle so make sure you hang out with as many as possible. My only problem was the hanging out with one person moves time on really fast, a simple activity such as reading will occupy half of the day meaning you will be rushing to get every confidant maxed out as the game really pushes you on as each day (as the game is mapped with a calender) is set with specific events. Persona 5 has the most plot twists i have ever seen and some events made me cry, laugh and smile with pure joy, the game really toys with your heart to the point that I was actually really upset when it ended. Some plot twists were jaw dropping others were predictable but fun all the same. The game does start slow however, the first hour of this 160 hour game (for me) was really vague, to any new persona player the first hour will be utterly confusing. Past players may have an idea of whats happening but new ones will be completely in the dark. Luckily after that first hour everything gets somewhat explained and new players will enjoy a smooth story game which is fun for everyone.Another Amazing point is the soundtrack. All tracks seem very similar in style but all pack an amazing punch, the musical element really makes the game such as ""life will change"" and ""last surprise""The game offers a side quest mode too, Mementos, mementos is the palace of the general public where you will fight enemy shadows at peoples request, at the end of the game due to it being story driven and story only all side quests you want to do MUST be complete by the end of the game.Positives:-engaging lengthy story-bubbly characters-good va-unique and enjoyable battle system-fun everyday activities-mesmerising soundtrackSmall cons:-slow at start for new playersMixed feelings:-game moves very fastThe cons are really nothing to effect the overall rating as you can easily brush them off, small nitpicks on my part",Grease

With that said I believe a lot of the people here complaining are either trolls or have been playing on the awkward controls that is keyboard and mouse.I ordered this game on Origin this morning and thought I'd give it a try since they offer a nice refund policy. After 27GB of download later I found myself quite disappointed with the results. My system met the recommended system requirements yet there were still quite a lot of stutters with framerates. I'm not particularly picky about graphics when it comes to these games especially when it offers a huge amount of content so lowering the settings to minimal helped a bit with that problem. However, there's also this problem with the controls on the keyboard and mouse that I have a major issue with. It made the game feel really cheaply made like a typical MMO with clunky WASD controls. Movement feels weightless and the controls for camera, aiming, and skills just don't seem solid enough.  Also the tactical view is so disconnected from the game that it's like the game is constantly pushing you to play the third person mode instead. The camera work on tactical mode is just as bad sadly. I was hoping to get the sort of controls that was in dragon age where everything felt familiar and you have really solid control over the camera angles over fights.I suppose majority of the work went into the gamepad because after 30 mins I could not bare to play with the keyboard and mouse. I immediately plugged in my ds4 controller and my goodness, the controls were smooth and felt real really great. It was so good on the controller that it was like playing a whole different game. So right after that I decided to get a refund on origin and grabbed myself a ps4 copy and after a couple hours on the game, I must say, everything I read in the reviews are just spot on. This game could end up as one of my favourite games of all time and has a really good spot right beside skyrim.Moral of the story, do not play with keyboard and mouse, it's a nightmare!",MDaxus

And maybe, just maybe, I would get a fun boss like Delilah to order me around.OH GOD, DELILAH! HOW I LOVE YOU SO!!Delilah is the main reason I enjoyed this game so much. She keeps you company while you explore the forest.She is a woman with a fun personality, so its hard to get bored when she is talking.The voice actors did an amazing job. Delilah and Henry conversations really feels natural.I wish the game was longer so I could listen to more of their dialogues!But alas, thats pretty much all the game has going for it. So you will either love it or hate it.There is a plot, but in my opinion it was one of the worse cases of ""wasted potential"" I seen in a game.Wont talk much about it so I dont spoil anything. Just dont think much about it and enjoy the ride.The game is short but very comfy, so buy it and play during the weekend. It will be worth it.",Nyarulathotep

It feels great when you put your soul into creating a clever level and have someone give you positive feedback.There are good tools available to help you fine-tune your levels to perfection, including being able to drop yourself into the level at any point and with any power-ups, and a gameplay-path tracer so you can master your obstacle/enemy positioning.Most of the levels you play will be pretty decent levels that feel very ""Mario.""  That's a very good thing.  Occasionally, however, you'll come across incredible, fantastic levels that make you wish Nintendo would hire those people to design levels for the actual Mario games.  And then there are other great levels that aren't very long, but rely on execution of a single difficult trick to complete, that will make you feel like you've accomplished something impossible when you finally get it.The number of n00b-fodder levels is limited by a clever system.  When you start the game, you can only upload 10 levels to share, but if your levels are acclaimed by people ""starring"" them, you will be allowed to upload more levels.  This way, the number of levels designed by people who suck at level design are limited while people who make fantastic levels will be able to upload more, thus making better levels available to you.Oh, and if you don't like a level, you can skip it.The not-so-good:Play a ""100 Mario Challenge"" and I guarantee you that you'll come across at least one level that bothers you.  While there are (rarely) some clever ""auto-Mario"" stages where you don't touch anything and you're bounced around on springs et al, I hate most of the ""auto-Mario"" style levels.  There are also levels that are neither original nor very ""Mario"" feeling, or any good at all.  And while the addition of special effects can marginally enhance a level, more often than not those special effects are abused to make super, super annoying levels.Also in the negative column:  It's not very fun to watch your kids make levels.All in all:I recommend this game.

I like the conceit of the series, and I really want to be a fan.  However, the only game that stands out as exceptional to me is Pirate's Curse.  Taking away Shantae's magic and transitioning her to using pirate gear to explore a metroidvania-esque overworld and zelda-like dungeons made for a great game with great controls, solid pacing, and decent variety.Half-Genie Hero feels like a massive step backward, both in terms of design and concept.  The visual design of everything and the animation look great and the music is good if unmemorable.  Shantae has always had a good sense of personality to it.  What's holding this game back is the muddled level design and lack of compelling content.Levels are now segmented and largely linear in design, like a platformer.  Shantae's controls are smooth and responsive, but there's no momentum to her movement, making platforming stiff.  There's still exploration to be done within those levels, but the vast majority of the collectables you find are only used to unlock the good ending, there's very little in terms of actual upgrades during the game.  Transformations come back, but besides the monkey and the harpy, they offer little in terms of movement options and are really only there to unlock certain areas to get the aforementioned underwhelming collectibles. Transformations are necessary for most meaningful exploration, but you won't know that until you get to a point where you need to use them like a key to open the treasure chest, making early game exploration a waste of time.  Also, there are two separate underwater transformations.  That's an obnoxious thing to realize after wandering around as a crab for 10 minutes trying to reach a mermaid-exclusive collectable.  Across the board, every aspect of design seems to be working against everything else.The difficulty of the game is pretty low except for a few exceptions where it ramps up suddenly.  There was one area early in the game when I still had low health and I had to dodge enemy arrows, leap between falling platforms over bottomless pits, avoid enemies leaping up from those pits and so on and so on.  I died more to that section than any other part of the game.  Nothing else comes close to how much it expects you to do there.  There's no structure to the difficulty, it wanes and waxes at random, implying very little thought was put into making the game both fair and challenging.Storywise this feels less like a game and more like a pitch for a Shantae animated series.  There's potential in that idea, but as a result the game feels like it's saying ""So here are all the characters you're going to get to know.""  Then the game is over after that introduction.  It makes the actual experience feel cheap and hollow.  The character's are just there to do their one thing and then wave at the camera.The game is also too short.  It's unhelpful to demand that every game meet some arbitrary time code, but there are 6 levels.  None of them are particularly interesting or memorable.  The game uses exploration as a crutch to pad out the time, and by making most of it require you to double back and come back later, they pad it out even more.  Length is an issue for indie developers.  When you have limited resources and staff, making a massive ambitious title is just setting yourself up for failure.  But Shantae has been getting funded by its fans for years now.  It's consistently successful on kickstarter, and the previous game felt like it had much more content than this one.  What happened?This game just feels like brand management.  It's there to remind people that Shantae is a game.Nothing about it is interesting.  Nothing is executed particularly well outside of the visuals, and even then it's not like that was a necessary evolution, the last game looked great too.  WayForward is a company I'd like to like more, but most of their flagship series comes across as sloppy and unrefined.  Half-Genie Hero isn't a terrible game, but it's a game I would never recommend.",samstrom

Also, there is no need to complain about the ""feel"" of modern warfare. I thought that the reason everyone loved and preferred the series was because they enjoyed the fast pace feel of it. Lastly, the graphics aren't much of an improvement... but there is a difference between mw2 and mw3. Lets be honest, it is not like you have been playing mw2 this whole time...just compare them to the previous CoD's graphics because that is what was made and played last.

At the first glance it doesn't look bad, you can import your old character, game tells you what choices have you taken (the most important ones naturally), you can customize looks like in ME, classes have close resemblance to ME2 ones (similar abilities, new ""specialization""-like forks though + some additional skills sometimes), and god, after you're done it starts. Intro might look ok, but certainly graphics don't - engine got old, but it's not a excuse, you feel like playing some low grade console port instead of major game, textures are hideous, animations as well (especially Anderson's, and omg, he's footaged even in demo), nothing special in lightning or mimics departments, so in short - it's like ME2, bah, maybe even worse. Art direction makes up for it though, as it did before, some views are really stunning plus majority of ""open"" areas (open only by name, zones are as small as they used be) really feels deep. No major concerns about music/sound, even though like 50% or more is reused which hurts. You'd think they moved some budget elsewhere (like story, dialogues etc.), but then ""fun"" begins. Main plot is really shallow, each subsequent mission kinda pushes you through, pace is just too high, I admit, some turns really are decent, but imho, everything is just too blatant and easy to anticipate, especially closer to ending - it's like they either ran out of cash or EA pushed devs so game could be released earlier. I don't know, but for sure, ending in this game is just very weak (at best), and can really cause outrage in some impatient fans. Anyway, it's still better than what was done to all the sidequests, now they're close to inexistent - like 80% them is simple ""get the item' (usually by snapping it from shops or finding in new user unfriendly galaxy exploration), bring it to Citadel (no other quest hub), talk to NPC and claim reward. No dialogue choices (bb persuading or threatening npcs for greater rewards), just probe-item-reward cycle over and over again. You can feel lucky if npc actually has anything to say, mostly it's just simple 1-liner w/o choice, just like it was with Kasumi and Zaeed ship dialogues in ME2. Now imagine it dumbed down even more, and you get brief look on how npc interaction looks, really. Yes, even with important persons, including team mates. When dialogue wheel appears you can be certain it's either opportunity for some questions regarding landmarks, persons etc. or binary paragon/renegade choice, ""Do or do not"" like Yoda would say, and it applies here in a very bad manner. You don't feel like you have control over action any more, not mentioning choices you've done before (if importing) are barely touched, should you kill or spare certain people (notably ME2 squad mates), outcome is basically the same, npc gets replaced by some random other, lines stay the same, and it just keeps turning like it was. Hell, I even tried dialogue with 'Irritating Man' with opposite choices and it was just the same, only Shep's lines changed. For the joke's sake you had paragon/renegade limited choices, and they didn't do the trick either, which is just ridiculous (not enough money for creating proper dialogue scripts and doing VA? I don't think so) and pushes you away from game. So far I could name only 2 things that changed in plus - combat and weaponry. Fighting is much faster than it was in ME2, you get some new skills and ways to customize them, also choice of weapons is much larger, with additional customization in that field by adding 2 mods of choice for each. Now you have to decide if you want, let's say super strong Black Widow rifle or some small SMG, because each one differs in weight and your overall balance changes cooldowns on abilities, by either shortening them or lengthen by as much as 200% (if really encumbered). You have some fancy new mechanics like shooting through walls and such. All in all not too shabby, but not with these controls, especially often cumbersome space usage. Since I'm close to 5k limit, I'll just do a quick balance:+fast-paced fights with various tactics applicable +weapons customizable again! +overall design -gfx -story -dialogues -interaction -exploration -side quests-""flat"" choices-close to 0 influence on story outcome-certain plot turns are just plain stupid-npcs have no character (especially new)-multiplayer-ME badge in spite of being that bad-horrid endings-general lack of polish-1st day DLC not free (greedy much?)-OriginYup, it's really that big let down, no BW games for me anytime soon, unless they repent and leave leeches from EA.",puzzlemaniak

At the same time I was a little worried, the Witcher short stories written by Andrzej Sapkowski are truly a work of literary art. The lore is rich enough to envision the entire world of the Witcher. Andrzei was able to paint an entire world so detailed you wouldn't have any transition going into the games after reading the stories. I doubted whether or not the game would truly capture what makes the stories so amazing, yet I was not only proven wrong but completely amazed.The Witcher is unlike any RPG, where your choices do not have a clear ""Good guy choice"" or ""Bad guy choice"" instead you will be faced with choices that warrant deep thought be put into it before deciding. Just like real life, you'll make decisions that you thought were the right choice but only for them to end up having severe consequences. Just like real life you'll have to learn those mistakes as you progress through. Usually RPGs will have choices but their outcomes rarely change the story, they'll have cosmetic changes and maybe certain characters will react differently to you but there are no branching paths.Witcher 3 Wild Hunt improves so much upon previous titles. Witcher 2 had open sections of a story that you'd progress and move on to the next area. It gave the illusion of an open world but without the freedom. Witcher 3 has a vast world with many small minute details that most of which will go unnoticed. But for those few dedicated fans who love to scour the land to find all the nooks and crannies will be rewarded by doing so.Crafting, character builds, abilities, the in-depth inventory and easy access to potions & spells makes the game feel comfortable to play. It takes only a few minutes to get used to the game and understand combat, however being skilled in combat will take some time and strategic planning. The game is difficult, as it should be. Reading the books and immersing yourself into the game will actually help you with combat. Books and knowledge provide insight on the lore as well as learning enemy weaknesses.The story is still by far the best part of this game. To get the most amazing RPG experience playing this game, I highly recommend you make choices as you would if you were in Geralt's shoes. This adds immersion and really makes you think about your choices. Do not look up walkthroughs, exploration is one of the best aspects of this game. And I also recommend reading up on Witcher lore, it's incredible. From the Witcher's, the drunken hilarious Dwarfs that you'd be crazy to challenge to an arm wrestling match, the lore behind The Black Ones, the circle of Mages and the war of the crowns are all amazing tales to be heard.I don't just recommend this game, I'm telling you this game deserves your purchase. This game will give you an experience that's more than worth the $60 price. Open world RPG's are not always given the spotlight in the mainstream gaming media but Witcher is definitely worth that spotlight. Open world RPGs and Action Adventure games are meant to give you a grand sense of adventure, exploration, immersion and an experience you won't find in other genres. Witcher 3 is an experience you won't forget.",Slevin310

While the soundtrack isThe problem I have with ""musically themed"" games like this is that they usually have little to do with music to begin with but instead you get a normal platformer or whatever other genre the try to press into it and listen to an unusual soundtrack while playing it. So I had high hopes for Sound Shapes, but unfortunately, it pretty much falls into the same category. While the soundtrack is (mostly) pretty good and interesting, the only way it  is linked to the gameplay is that you collect coins in the levels that will then add something to the music. A few times, what goes on on the screen is in ""the rhythm"" of the music, that's about it. So, at least for me, the game more or less fails to bring anything new or interesting to the table. The levels themselves are, with a few exceptional parts, extremely easy to get through and even getting every coin in every level is ridiculously easy. They didn't even try to make it hard to either find or reach them, they're just ... there. I got them all on my first time through the levels with little to effort. So the platforming is somewhat ... pointless, too. It's still fun to play, though, and with the ... thing you control sticking to certain surfaces, it does have a nice little, unique twist to it, but honestly, nothing special otherwise, so I was tempted to give this 6 out of 10, especially if you think about how shockingly short this game is as well, at least the campaign. However, there's the editor and for that, I added another point, because this could breed a lot of interesting levels, even though you're pretty much stuck with the sounds and items provided by the game's artists. Downside: of course you can only access new levels when having a decent internet connection ready, which is not a given for a handheld game and not everyone has WLAN at home. If you purchase this game, you get the PS3 version for free, though, so you can always get new levels there. If user generated content has proven one thing so far, it'd be to never underestimate the creativity of a passionate community. Other than that, this this game pretty much only lives on its artistic value which is definitely there with the music and designs. 7 out 10. 6 or even less if you don't care for user generated/-ing content.",iBash

121442,Fallout 4,XboxOne,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This is definitely going to be game of the year with a large open world, a large variety of perks, weapons, armor, and so much more.A Dead Land: The game excels when it comes to its open world. Lots of enemies, new ways explore the world, and it's been reported that Fallout 4's map size is 11 minutes long vertically. And trust me it's large. The game looks gorgeous with a new creation engine. Some people say it isn't graphically up to date but you have to admit, it is a giant leap from Fallout New Vegas (2010). Plus with lots of new radio stations and lots of side quests in which other companions could possibly react towards the actions of these side missions and some may interest you. You can also create your own settlement that you have to keep resourced, defended, and a simple place to let settlers rest and go on with their business.200-Life Crysis: The game takes place a few minutes or hours ""depending how long you create your character"" before the bombs have dropped. So you soon enter Vault 111 where a freak experiment goes horribly wrong. Since your 200 year cryogenic stasis, takes you deep into the future in where you have to find your son Shaun who has been kidnapped by the institute a isis like group who kidnaps survivors of the commonwealth. So it is your job to take him back.Guns n' more bullets: Shooting is more playable. V.A.T.S. is still a thing in this Fallout installment but shooting a gun feels more shooty than your average Fallout game. Your guns no longer break so you can shoot with letting it break but it looses a more survival focused aspect but I didn't like survival focused aspects anyway. You can also customize your amazing little guy into a F***ing beast, with re-naming it, adding new weapon mods that are available to all weapons. Legendary enemies drop legendary loot and it is either amazing or surprising. You can also choose when you want to get a critical strike on an enemy or not. It you get enough hits on enemies, you will build up a bar that will fill up and create an execution command and vats no longer pause the game it will slow it down the game leaving vulnerable to an easy but cheap death, so act fast.The Uglies returned: Enemies look more disgusting and more terrifying than ever before. With new ones such as bloodbugs and synths. Oh and if you hate deathclaws they're back and deadlier than ever. Enemies with a star next to them represent Legendary enemies. Enemies featured with a skull next to them, f***ing run. You can guess who is the first is to encounter.Packin' a punch: The amount of base perks built in to the game are over 70 but go a little deeper and you will find over 200 perks. How, they are counted a mini perks to a perk. Let that sync in to your head before moving on. Bobbleheads make a return but a little more impactful than Fallout 3. A little hint the perception bobblehead is the first to be found usually.The game runs at 1080p, 30fps or so I've heard. Smooth for the most part but sometimes dips but no where below 20fps. Lowest: 24fps that I have seen. Also mods are on Xbox One now. WOOHOO!For reviews on Need For Speed (10) and Need For Speed Rivals (9), check my other reviews. See ya.",Lilmanike

If FPS-RPG hybrids are not your thing, if guns AND space magic is not your thing, if pseudo-MMO grinding is not your thing, then turn back.  That's here to stay.Destiny 1 had a very ruptured, uncohesive, mess of pre-grind activity.  The campaign, sidequests, and patrol zones were vacant, lifeless, and confusing.  Also, there was maybe 8 hours of content at most if you did eveything.Destiny 2 fixes quite a lot.  At the $60 price point it comes in with easily 40 hours of pre-grind content.  Your milage may vary, but if you were to do all of the main quests, all adventures, all challenges, get all one-shot chests/lost sectors etc, it'd easily clock in at 40 hours despite the fact that you'd be level capped long, long before then.  Public events are far more frequent and Heroic mode for them is much more exhilarating.  Mission design, flow of zone and dungeons, strike design, etc are all vastly improved over its predecessor and shows that Bungie is learning from what works and didn't work.The big sting comes from the lack of difference though.  It kind of opens a still sore wound.  Destiny 2 is really Destiny 1 HD turbo enhanced edition.  All the QoL improvements from Year 2 Destiny are in, spruced up, and better.  Nearly every mechanic that stuck that was poorly implemented is now presented with care, attention, and polish.  Anything that wasn't broken got a fresh coat of paint, but it's still Destiny 1.  Destiny 1 may as well have been a very expensive Early Access/Beta for Destiny 2, for all intents and purposes.  A tech demo, if you will.  However, at the end of it, with all that pain moved on from, Destiny 2 is the truest (for now) culmination of this genre and these ideas.  Bungie tried to do something new in Destiny 1 and it went completely pear shaped for years.  They picked up the pieces, learned, hit the drawing board hard, and came through strong with Destiny 2.  Bungie finally made the game they wanted to make in the first place, with all the bells and whistles now that ancient hardware was thrown out of the compatibility list.  That's the big thing though.  Bungie made Their Game.  They made Destiny 2, not ""space magic Call of Duty"" or ""Halo but with superpowers.""Many negative reviews and death-grip grudges for the game are because people were still expecting something very different from what Bungie is trying to do.  These people will find no solace in this game because Bungie did not compromise.I cannot overstate though.  Unlike Destiny 1, Bungie completely delivered.  Bungie went all-in and didn't sacrifice any of their vision for the final product to appease to people who want something else and the whole is much stronger for it.  Is it a perfect game?  Nah, but if games like Destiny 1, The Division, or Borderlands ever piqued your interest then here be the game likeminded gamers have been begging for.",Cirrusstrafe

I play on all star because this year superstar and HOF are unbearable if you plan on winning games. But even in all star the game is coded for you to lose. I have lost so many games due to my teammates and it is highly annoying. I am a PF and i have high rebounding and athleticism so i grab a lot of rebounds but whenever i am in the paint my teammates make the dumbest shots but when i am outside the paint they start missing wide open shots. It's like they don't want me to get many rebounds or something. Your teammates also make careless mistakes when the game is on the line. I just lost a game where the game was tied with a min seconds left and we had the ball. Rondo threw a pass right out of bounds. I got a block on defense but next time down the court Demarcus Cousins was in post up position and he turned around to shoot jumper right in Pau Gasol's face and got blocked. Next time down the court Derrick rose held the ball and scored a wide open layup with 2 seconds left to go up by 2. We called a timeout and advanced the ball. The AI then inbounded the ball to ben mcklemore to shoot a fading 3 pointer in 2 people's faces to lose the game. I was wide open for a mid range shot.

If not we'd beat the game in a month and move onto the next game, plus these fetch quests have you travelling (or teleporting if you're rich).

You might be thinking, why would I want to play the same game twice, but there's multiple starting towns and you can start somewhere else too, this really adds to replayability (at least for each starting town).Minus one point for FATEs which are a boring grind and give far too high a reward.",Clarence_L
