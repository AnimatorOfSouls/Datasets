Bioshock’s innovative narration tells the story of Rapture’s high-class citizens through the accessible audio logs scattered throughout the city.  The voice acting is brilliant and following the tales of these secondary characters spruces up Bioshock’s overall story.  This method of narration is very effective, because it doesn’t interrupt the main focus of Bioshock: the gameplay.  Simply referring to this game as just a first person shooter is doing Bioshock a disservice.  It features revolutionary RPG mechanics and unrivaled level design.  Scrounging around an area for unique ammunition, Eve hypos, and invaluable weapon upgrade stations are rewarding experiences.  Most importantly, participating in Bioshock’s clever level design will prepare you for the chaotic skirmishes with Big Daddies, which are menacing guardians that protect the little Adam factories with their massive drills, rivet guns, and rocket launchers.  There are two forms of currency in Rapture: dollars and Adam.  Dollars are acquired through conventional means, such as searching crates or cracking safes.  However, Adam can only be gathered by the orphaned girls venturing through Rapture in search of “angels”.  Unfortunately, Bioshock is no masterpiece, especially the PC port.  You cannot rebind plasmids or weapons to a particular hotkey, and hacking machines are time consuming and temporarily bring Bioshock’s exciting gameplay to halt.  In addition, the game is also plagued with some mouse sensitivity and audio problems.  However, the sound and mouse issues are fixable.  Bioshock’s unrivaled story and groundbreaking gameplay mechanics deliver a nearly perfect gaming experience.",ChrisOzzie

It is intended to direct a franchise in a new direction and gain a broader audience. I had no cons about the ideas behind the revitalizing of the series  its mythos, but merely with the execution of the ideas.PRESENTATION: Very Good. The artistic story telling is fantastic in the game, as well as the in game text to amplify some action scenes. Menu has framerate issues but well laid out and simple to see.GRAPHICS: Good. Environment immerses the player into it and framerate is fluid to follow the action. The game overuses the orange  red color palette as well as the green  blue one which tends to saturate the world you are in after a couple of hours into the game.SOUND: Very Good. The soundtrack in the game is great and it delivers the theme of the game quite nicely. The voice acting is well done too, you can tell the brothers apart when they speak but also sense their relation...Mundus also delivered an impact performance. Sound effects are also very good but at times overwhelmed by the soundtrack.GAMEPLAY: Good. Heavily hindered by the level design, the gameplay mechanics are seamless, very well rounded and easy to implement. The amount of combos stretches as far as your imagination can, switching between Devil  Angel weapons is fast and fluid and the controls are quick and responsive. The pacing of the game is questionable for an action game, specially for one with such a deep combo system. The camera is good and user controlled for the most part and even pauses enemies from attacking you if they are off screen. The Devil Trigger suspends enemies into the air this time around while you inflict damage. As usual some health regenerates and there is increased damage.LEVEL DESIGN: Poor. This is where all the bad spots of the game came back to. The traversal through the game is mainly compromised by jumping. EVERYWHERE. It became tedious after seeing how much it consisted to go through a level, and it broke the pacing of the game considerably, since some areas there was just too much of it. Overall Limbo is designed somewhere out of the Deconstructivism movement, where things are broken parts of themselves and the pieces make up an ugly whole. The best level design for me was the Disco level, and something I'd revisit, weird boss and all. The environments turn dull towards the end, slowing the adventure down. One of the Boss fights implements the platforming quite well, and that probably was as far as it should have been taken to make up the level design.STORY: Good. The new direction that they deviated the original storyline from was well implemented. Dante and Vergil being sons of a Demon  Angel, some type of anomaly that can extinguish evil is a believable storyline to start from. The explaining of their origin was engaging as well. The middle and ends of the plotline of the game however, are not.BEASTIARY: Very Poor. The enemies in DmC are not much for variety. Apparently anywhere you go in Limbo the demons are pretty much the same. They have different types of the same enemies, where ones are vulnerable to either Angel or Demon weapons. Overall you will face upgraded versions of the same enemies throughout the game. One in particular should have been a boss because he was really cool to face, and his upgraded versions, since the 5  a half boss fights in the 20 level game are deficient for an action game. They are mostly large, blob like figures instead of the fearsome creatures prevalent in games of this genre. They are quite the mixed bag  the fights consist of yes heavy PLATFORMING.DIFFICULTY: Easy. Accurate. I played the game on the Nephilim  Hard  difficulty and I barely died, ever. The game difficulty seems just about right so anyone can just pick this up and kick ass. Be aware that restarting a checkpoint counts as a death in the game  what?  and the autosave feature will NOT hold on to your items if you've used them and then died  or restarted ).LASTING APPEAL:Players of the previous games will most likely not favor this game too much. The story mode may be good for one play through, but the excessive platforming may anger God of War veterans as well as the lack of boss fights. Also being a short adventure   8 hours  and the lack of the Vergil DLC at launch to extend it, sadly is not enough to warrant a full retail purchase  like I did  I'd recommend holding off for God of War Ascension instead.I rate it a 7.5  10.0",El_Galant

270897,Final Fantasy XV,PlayStation4,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This is the best game I've ever played.. but I still expected a lot more! (MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD)I class myself as a Final Fantasy fan having played over ten titles. Loved VII, VIII, and X. Struggled out of boredom to finish XII and then didn't even bother with XIII.Since the first FFXV trailer in 2006 I've been eagerly anticipating the release of this title! I had pre ordered it on Amazon years in advance and on the day I received the copy I was ecstatic to say the least, even bought a new TV as the screen did not fit on my current one.The game starts off great and gets even better. The characters are the best of any FF and have so much potential! I am a pro turn based gamer but I have to admit the actual gameplay is amazing with an engaging combat mechanism and countless extras you can do from racing your car in a high speed chase to shooting machine guns at robots. I actually loved the summoning mode (although initially confusing on how to trigger it), and appreciated how the archaeons would come in times of need in a tough battle giving you a sense of relief whilst struggling against a feared enemy rather than any tiny powered gimmick that you could call countless times in a minor battle against a little chicken fiend.All of this awesomeness is varnished with an outstanding soundtrack to match (hats off to Shimomura-san).A downside evident fairly on however is the lack of cutscenes. Final Fantasy is loved by many for its wonderful storytelling in its high quality scenes but this desperately lacked those moments. At first I thought it was as they had transferred all the early scenes to the Kingsglaive movie and that as you passed that point in the game, the story would pick up. It never did. The game was left with so many gaps in the story and events happening off screen it was hard to understand the plot let alone enjoy it. Despite ten years in making, after a certain point in the game it felt completely rushed and unfinished. Don't get me started on how annoying and tedious Chapter 13 was.The brief story telling they did have was still completely inadequate. It seemed as though all the epicness of the XIII versus trailers had been totally lost. The one scene where Noctis meets Stella had more chemistry than the entire game with Luna. I felt so little for Luna that after her death I actually hoped they'd bring Stella into it and Noctis would forget all about his penfriend who he was told he should marry.The character Noctis previously portrayed was a strong, confident prince now turned into an annoying spoilt brat. It would have worked if his character developed over time, but it hardly did.Then came the ending, leaving me completely disappointed. With the ten year time jump, they had so much opportunity to give us some emotional heartfelt scenes. With the King returning ten years on after being thought dead (just like Simba). The moment his friends first see him alive and are completely stunned with joy. The moment he meets Iris, and Cid, and all his old friends. The moment he returns to the now refugee camp of Lestallum and his people heartily cheer his return with a newfound hope. None of that happened however and you were left with a complete anti-climax.Then came Insomnia, the home I was so longing to explore and renovate back to its former glory. It however served nothing but a stage for the final boss.Why can Square Enix not finish a game without killing off the hero? I get that tragedy works in bringing tears and all but not when they do it every single time. If you think about it, the whole game was a waste as Ardyn actually got what he wanted and Noctis lost everything. How ridiculous.An epic scene towards the end would have been the first Versus XIII trailer ever. They could have left it as Noctis losing all his friends from Chapter 13 and then returning to Insomnia. Sitting on the throne in depression, thinking he had lost everything. Empire sending in all their troops after him and he comes outside and kills a few handfuls of them without any emotion and then returns to his throne as he did, now yielding the power of the ring (which for some reason had become a weak toy in the game compared to all its power in Kingsglaive when wielded by Nyx). That would have really pleased us with the trailer nostagia. Then continued with whatever story and ended with him restoring Lucia back to its days of former glory as a bad ass king. Allowing you to explore the open World once more in the present day.Despite all these criticisms I still enjoyed the game. After clocking it I'm still finding loads of new stuff to do even though i had completed all the sidequests previously. I'm looking forward to the updates now. I know this would probably be very cliche and annoying but I actually want Square Enix to release another game via DLC suggesting Chapter 9 onwards was all just a bad dream and rehash the entire second part of the story to how it should have been!",Mangs

Single player is exactly how the game should be.. fast corridoor action game with tonnes of diving and bullet-time physics, along with excellent cutscenes that move fluidly between action and story in a way that is seemless. Where the game starts to look a bit shabby is the bolt-on multiplayer game side of things. While singleplayer is suited to the 3rd person view, competive play most certainly is not, for starters the crosshair is off centred so you often can't see the target when behind cover without exposing your arse making the cover system a bit flakey when combined with the iffy locking method it uses. The other big issues are ""always on radar"" which is very noob for a game with such tiny maps, sure you can earn xp unlocks to help reduce visibility but really this game should not have a radar at all as default, sadly you have to grind out 5000 kills to play hardcore mode that doesn't feature this.  My final annoyances are the fairly low map count and that most of them are pretty damn small COD size crap, I was expecting at least something more in line with a single zone from GTA4 size, also they are touting a season DLC pass for £20, which is loathsome and ends up making the game cost £70 to have a complete game which is a ripoff no matter what they add.  Overall a fun short term action shooter, with small scale multiplayer that could be really good if they fixed some of the console grade port issues...if the DLC does that then maybe it'll be good... but if its more of the same, don't bother.  8/10",HighwayUK

Yes it has classes, as unlockables, but that is a bad idea for the future of the game. In a months time any newcomers are going to have a hell of a time due to eveyrone else having bonuses and better equipment. Single player wise 3 missions in and i didn't know why i was invading this planet, i was told that these people are bad, that they invaded somewhere else, but why are they bad enough for the player to become like them by invading them, am i the bad guy? There is no explaination and i had to read the manual to understand why i was on the planet, that is bad storytelling. Also the description given to us by sony should not be the entire plot of the game, if it can be summed up that easily then theres something wrong! Gunplay is ok, again average, only being able to hold 2 guns makes it more realistic but if you do that, do not make the player pick up a rocket launcher just to open up a gate or something then have to swap back, its annoying.Other than that guns pretty generic (see the pattern here!) the gun with a dot scope, the single shot accurate gun etc, the cover system works quite well in single player, dunno why it doesn;t seem to be in multi or it is and I just havn;t spotted it Yes it has tacked on motion controls, and I am yet to figure out why reviewers are ok with ps3 tacked on motion controls when wii tacked on motion controls make them foam at the mouth and drop the score by 2 points. All in all a average shooter, kudos to the developer they did a good job, but with other shooters out there they really needed to do something different!

Combat system is among the worst ever. Roll and roll with the occasional Quen sign and some mouse clicks. Boring.The maps are really small, and the gameplay is really just busywork in between the story segments.Alchemy is useless, magic aside Quen is not really useful.There enemy AI is braindead, and playing in higher difficulties just makes the enemies HP sponges and the bosses like the Kraken, a cancer.I am sorry, but this is a video game, not an interactive novel, and as a game it is just not very good.The story is still stellar, and the graphics are awesome.

255058,Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack,Switch,8,"Azure Striker Gunvolt is back, and on the Switch this time. The original games were on the 3DS, dating back to 2014 and 2016 respectively. If you're familiar with them, this is a nice way to snatch them up together with all the DLC and the option of playing on a larger screen. Plus the Switch's handheld screen is larger and the system more powerful. The game does look a bit pixelated onAzure Striker Gunvolt is back, and on the Switch this time. The original games were on the 3DS, dating back to 2014 and 2016 respectively. If you're familiar with them, this is a nice way to snatch them up together with all the DLC and the option of playing on a larger screen. Plus the Switch's handheld screen is larger and the system more powerful. The game does look a bit pixelated on the big screen, but it IS meant to appeal to the retro crowd...For those unfamiliar, this is a platformer made in the style of Megaman Zero/ZX, but it's hardly a clone. You follow the titular character, Gunvolt (real name unknown) on a quest to topple an evil syndicate called The Sumeragi group. And in the second game, an organization called Eden. Both bent on, you guessed it, World Domination.The action focuses on speeding through levels, killing enemies, collecting goodies, and ultimately beating the bosses. Challenges can be accessed for stages after initial completion, adding to replay value. It keeps things fresh and involved while you attempt to beat your high score, or farm materials for equipment.Equipment is used in this game in a variety of ways. It can give you more durability, improve your moves, or in some instances, remove the game's modern conveniences for a more hardcore experience. The materials are won from completing challenges and by collecting items from a series of boxes after completing each level. Your score dictates how many you can open initially, but you can collect medals through each stage to win more chances. The lottery aspect can be annoying at times, but satisfying when you get juuust the right item.Combat is fun and unique. Your gun is mostly just there to tag your opponent and does only light damage. Lightning provides most of your punch, channelled into your opponent directly and in varying degrees, depending on how many times you tagged your target. When playing Gunvolt 2, you get a second character, Copen, who plays completely different. He glides around with a rocketpack, rarely spending any time on the ground. He jets around and tags enemies by crashing into them, then shooting them. Unlike GV's arsenal, Copen's is quite lethal. He also has the Megaman style ability of taking boss's abilities and using them against each other in the old ""this boss's weapon beats that other boss"" style rock, paper, scissors method.The bosses are what you would expect from a Megaman game. Minibosses are usually huge and provide moderate challenge. Stage bosses are colorful characters that will banter with GV or Copen, if you have that option selected. Unfortunately these are no English VAs, but text is provided to distract you as they pummel you. The fights vary from boss to boss. Some are easy breezy, others require a bit more attention and forethought. They all possess a super move (that also varies in splendor from boss to boss) that will trigger after you have depleted 2/3rds of their health, and can be triggered again from that point until their death.The story is surprisingly deep for a platforming game and well crafted. It's not terribly original though, using many tropes from anime and many story themes from the X-men. The characters will banter throughout stages just as they do during boss fights, and this is still completely optional. Unlike the Playstation-era Megaman games Gunvolt resembles, the conversations won't stop your character from moving or progressing. There are also plenty of cutscenes, though none are animated. It's all splash images with dialogue bars. The art is top notch, though.The Striker Pack also has some difficulty tunings and some minor level and item location changes. It unfortunately suffers from being $40, where each game could be bought on the 3DS eshop for $14.99 each and found frequently on sale for lower. Is the extra price hike worth it? That depends on you. If you're spoiling to add a kickass game to your Switch, sure. If you're the frugal type, or if you already own the 3DS versions, you may reconsider. It's already a great platformer, though, and a very worthy successor to the Megaman Legacy. If that's not your jam then you may not enjoy this game. Some looking for a Megaman fix may also be offput by how not-Megaman the game actually is. It has its own style, and it's fresh. The game is not perfect by any means, but it's still a joy to handle. If you're still feeling trepidacious, at least give the first game a shot on the 3DS.On a final note, the endings... are not something I wish to spoil, but I would like to make note that neither game's 'true' ending is available the first time you beat the final boss. If you want that ending, and I hope you do, you'll be coming back for seconds.",Lowkey

163359,Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin,PlayStation4,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        CONTAINS SPOILERS: Dark Souls II Scholars of the first sin is definitely a great journey... not only into the story, but into skills as well. It is important to use Your souls to 1, fortify Your weapon and gear, 2, update Your character, 3, learn from Your own mistakes with each death You die, 4, find the right gear and weapons and especially find and use the right rings (especially the ring that blocks hollowing on 75% is the most important thing in the game). Each time You die in a boss fight makes You crave to kill that bastard more and more until You beat him (hello smelter demon... ;) ). Some parts seem hard at first but when You choose the right approach You will really be surprised how the game is easy to play (take those buggers one by one ;) )",Rabensblut

You'll spend at least 25 hours in the game to beat it if you complete most of the side quests, and you won't regret a single second of it.The game is essentially a better version of Dead Space, but less linear and incorporates BioShock mechanics as well as a deep story and a reasonable amount of freedom for you to approach your objectives.STORYIf you enjoy space movies, particularly ones relating to habitation in a space vessel, station, or base, you're in for a treat. The first of its kind for a video game, Prey is about a lone survivor who has been deserted on a space station that has been taken over by sentient alien lifeforms.Waking up one day and not remembering anything that happened in the past, as you explore the station and progress, you will find out more and more about what happened to the station and what their crew specializes in: alien technology research.You find out that you have a sibling who is also alive on the station, but all is not as it seems as there is a more ulterior motive behind what's going on in the station and your sibling is following their own agenda.GAMEPLAYThis game is not a hardcore alien shooter. It's closer to a game like BioShock or Dishonored where you have many weapons and abilities at your disposal and can mix and match play styles as necessary.Similar to the Dishonored series or recent Deus Ex games, there is a skill system where you distribute ""Neuromods"" to the particular skills you wish to acquire in order to improve your character or allow you to do more in the game.There are all sorts of enemies in the game and each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses. You are required to research them in order to learn new alien abilities and to know the best way to deal with them. Ammunition isn't overly abundant in the game, so you do need to avoid being wasteful to a degree.One unique mechanic of Prey is that you are able to fly in space and zero-gravity areas in the station. It is clear that Bethesda spent a lot of time on this mechanic, as it is very realistic and very satisfying to play.Although quests are spread out all across the station, the game is enjoyable enough that going back and forth from place to place isn't a total chore. It's fun to explore every nook and cranny and to collect things. A lot of work was placed into map design. Exploring new areas is interesting as no two places are the same.Bethesda incorporated a stealth system into the game like they did in Dishonored, but it's somewhat weak and doesn't reward you in any way for it. Personally, I feel that Prey is better enjoyed by just playing it without focusing on stealth. The game wasn't built to be played a second time, and wasn't meant for you to let enemies stay alive. The game is already difficult enough as it is.The only complaint I have with the game is the insignificance of many mechanics that are incorporated but are seemingly meaningless in the game. For example, radiation is virtually a non-issue, and most of the Typhon Neuromod upgrades are not needed to beat the game even though there are plenty of them to choose from. This causes the game to be a little one-dimensional.SUMMARYThere's not much more I can say about the game. I definitely recommend playing it as it is unique and well-designed. The story is immersive and it is fun to think of the best way to approach a situation.I strongly advise installing the game on an SSD since you will often need to go from area to area and the load times can get annoying after a while.I give this game a 9 out of 10 for being a memorable experience. If I ever need to recommend a space station exploration game, Prey is definitely one of them.",nitorita

Not to mention, most people have not played enough hours of this game to have the credibility to pass such judgment. That being said, here are the only issues I have with this game:PC: Look at minimum system requirements! You're going to have a rough time playing if your hardware isn't good! You wont even be able to get it running on a dual-core!360: Graphics aren't too good, which makes sense. I was hoping for graphics to be more polished, but it's understandable considering how much graphics must be scaled down to run this on a previous generation console. Graphics are on par with Skyrim on 360, but if you're looking for a gem, you're going to be disappointed.One/PS4: No complaints besides software issues with PS4. It happens people. Unless youre a software designer who thinks they could do a better job, let them work through the bugs. It happens with EVERY game.Positives: This game brings the best of DA Origins and II without most of their negatives. It's open world, and not linear. Your character has great movement and its not blocky or clunky. It is more strategic than DA II, being a little less tactical than DA Origins. Just a little. I'd consider calling it a well-polished, updated DA Origins. There's so much more customization in the game than previous ones. You can customize the way you look, how gear looks, and modify weapons/armor. Combat is great. You have gap closers for melee and awesome animations for ranged characters. Auto attacks give it the feel of a hack and slash while still having tactical options. I've played well-through Skyrim, including all DLC's and this game's combat and exploration reigns supreme over the amount of utility I've gotten from playing Skyrim. It seems to have taken the positive aspects of Skyrim and improved upon it's weaknesses (combat, non-customizable armor). I loved Skyrim. I love this game even more.Negatives: Release bugs. It's annoying, yes, but it's totally understandable. As a user, I understand things need to be polished on their end.Graphics on 360. Theyre acceptable. I wish they had found a better option for graphics but things get complicated when trying to cover several platforms. If you have a One or PS4, get it. If you have a 360, it's definitely still worth the buy!! Just don't expect amazing graphics.Issues on PC: There are a lot of issues with PC compatibility. Of course, it's my fault for not looking at minimum requirements. Look at your hardware!!!! It's your responsibility to verify if itll work on your rig! (i.e Why would you buy Netflix if you don't have access to the internet?)Character interaction: It seems like your dialogue options don't have a lot of effect on the characters around you. You get notices of displeasure or pleasure with bad or good responses, but I've yet to see heavy repercussions of making a character hate me. Ofcourse, I'm nowhere near beating the game, so well see.I'd say this game is one of the best RPG's I've played to date. I like rankings so if it helps make up your mind, heres where I'd put it on the ladder:1. SW KOTOR2. DA Inquisition (So far around 20+ hours)3. Skyrim4. ME 35. DA Origins6. ME7. Witcher8+. KOTOR 2, DA II, Elder Scroll series, ME II and so on.Again, its a great game so far. Don't let the 0-4's fool you. This game is definitely not worth anywhere near that rating. The lowest rating I'd understand being given is maybe a 6 or 7 for 360 users or angry PC people who don't meet recommended hardware requirements. But then again, those people probably didn't put much time into the game warranting a reliable opinion.Hope this review has helped! Happy hunting!",Khashtodne

The beta for Uncharted 3 was so good, it was better than many other released AAA games. So I had high expectations for Uncharted 3. I bought Uncharted 3 on release date and played through the campaign first, as I do with all games. The campaign had a decent story line. Some of the puzzles didn't seem well thought out and one in particular felt clunky, like Drake wasn't going where I wanted him to go or do what I wanted. I read a review that said Drake walks like a drunken sailor in some parts and i noticed the same thing. Particularly annoying is that, for some reason, the devs created an OCD Drake that feels compelled to touch every wall as he passes by. Why? It seemed contrived as if they wanted to give him a personality tick that would make him seem more ""real."" But it was just real annoying. I mean even during chases, Drake has to stick out his had and touch walls. He didn't do that in Uncharted 1 or 2, so why does he suddenly have this OCD compulsion to touch walls as he walks by. Please get rid of that in UC4. However, in every other aspect, the game excels. The campaign was just the right length, not overacted, good pacing from scene to scene, good variety of weapons, good fights, and beautiful graphics. Some scenes were visually stunning, like the airplane scene and the desert scene. I gotta say the campaign was a little too easy and everyone seems to be platinum-ing it in days. Probably the easiest platinum I've ever achieved. But the multiplayer is where this game shines. The multiplayer is actually better than Uncharted 2, which is a great accomplishment by the developers. The maps are good and diverse and some have changing environments. For example, you can be in a match, and suddenly there is a blinding dust storm and you play through it. I also like the buddy system where you are paired with another player, which has advantages. I also like the powerplay aspect which helps even out the odds between mismatched teams. Uncharted 3 has a solid campaign and a stellar multiplayer that no other game out there can beat.

It's still essential to take things slow and to plan things carefully, and the game does a fantastic job of making you feel like a super spy.Your moves are expanded even further from the last two games, and there are new ways of interacting with the environment that give you tons of options. The new sound meter, which works cleverly with the noise of your surroundings, adds another layer of strategy to the gameplay. I love the way the NPCs begin to act terrified if you mess with them from the shadows, and you can really ""stalk your prey"" if you want to. The way you can freak them out and misdirect them is a kind of subtle power-trip that I didn't experience in any other stealth game until Dishonored came out. The way the NPCs talk to each other in general makes them more human, and the AI is better too, having them coordinate in interesting ways, which breaths new life into the gameplay.My favourite thing about this game is the level design. The game is just *perfect* at giving you freedom to approach situations how you want, while at the same time keeping you on a fairly linear progression through the map. It's kind of a balance of player choice mixed with a deliberate pacing that makes the level design in this game so damn good. The Bank Heist level in particular is pretty much a work of art, but each level is very well designed and very memorable. The game gives you so many options through interactivity with the environment that I'm still discovering new things to do in these levels 13 years later, and I've played through them more times than I care to count.It comes so close to being a masterpiece, but sadly still makes the same mistake that the previous games in the series made... It forces combat upon you in the last few levels. It is *possible* to avoid most direct combat encounters (not all of them), but the game starts putting you in hectic situations where shooting your way out can become your best option. I find this to be a very lazy way of escalating a stealth game, the mechanics aren't suited to it, and it's just frustrating. The only other thing I can think to criticise is the shameless product placement. Airwaves gum, Axe bodyspray, and Nokia phones are all over this game. I wouldn't mind if it was more subtle, but it's not.Still one of the best stealth games I've ever played though. Maybe even the best.",CynicMimic

(As much as you can start in march :'P)The Story is the origin of the female heroine Lara Croft but this is not the old Lara. This is a new Lara, one that is young and naive and has no past Tomb Raiding experience. I don't wanna ruin the story but as you know Lara is ship wrecked and need's to find a way off the Island, It's really rich and engaging and kept me intrigued in the story and wanting to know what happens next. The gameplay is very Uncharted based (Don't hate but it's true) in the way that you take cover while in gun fights, climb up cliffs and ledges, and well...just the overall feel of the gameplay. It's very fun and it works well. The graphics are excellent and really well done, the character models are really good and look realist. Lara herself is probably the best looking thing in the game because she looks and act's like a young women. Throughout playing the game I started to wonder if Crystal Dynamics even liked Lara because of some of the Death scenarios she goes through, I mean some are seriously gruesome, for example, I've seen her impaled by a tree, crushed by boulders, have a metal pipe through the skull and cracked her head open underwater by the current of the sea pushing her into the wall. So as you can see this game is not for the faint hearted as this is the first ever 18 age rated Tomb Raider. Camilla Luddington's performance as Lara is really good, she sells the character really well and plays it off very believable. Now for the weak parts of the game, the big major disappointment for me is the games competitive multiplayer, not only is it extremely weak, generic and nowhere near the standard of the games excellent single player component, it is trying to hard to match Uncharted's multiplayer just because of the way it looks and plays, I have no problem with Uncharted's MP but if you're going to make a copy of it at least put some effort into it and make it good in the progress. My main gripe with the MP is that it wasn't developed in-house at Crystal Dynamics, it was developed at Eidos Montreal which gives me the impression that Crystal didn't want it in the game but Square Enix wanted it placed in the game. The last problem I have is a little one but one that is still should be worked on in games, it's the fact that Lara goes from scared girl to trained killer in the space of about 10  15 minutes, I know she has to adapt to survive and she does have a cry after her first kill but what about the other 500+ men she kills along the way? This was a problem in another game called Far Cry 3, as I'm sure you know, anyway this is a small price to pay. In all  really enjoyed the game and I wasn't even a big Tomb Raider fan going into the game. I recommend you all pick up the game if you are past Tomb Raider fans who grew tired of the game and need a new outlook on the series, if you are a fan of the action genre or are just looking for a new game to play I can easily recommend Lara Croft: Tomb Raider!",Megacon89

266083,Metro 2033,PC,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Overview:Metro 2033 was a unique gaming experience. As far as Post-Apocalyptic settings go, the immersion level of this game exceeds that of any game I have played prior. Characters are unique, and interesting, and the environment truly makes you feel as though any moment could be your last.Gameplay:Metro 2033 has all the standards for FPS RPG, and has an even amount of positives to negatives. On the positive side, the gameplay is fluid, and what breaks you do endure between chapter sections offer narrative to make the wait less annoying. The narrative also helps keep the storyline together, as well as give you a perspective into your character’s thoughts and feelings. On the negative side, your character has no dialogue beyond this narrative, and you have no conversational choices beyond a scarce few ready-checks (two exceptions to that come to mind, but are minor in detail). This negative, however, is altogether unimportant considering the bigger picture  that your character is in a post-apocalyptic world and giving them options to be perky or silly would diminish the atmosphere. Besides, that’s Ulman’s job.On the plus side, you have a variety of weapons from which to choose. Your sturdy tactical knife is your savior if you run out of ammo or explosives. Throwing knives, while limited in the quantity you can carry, are extremely effective and silent; key for stealthing through levels. Revolvers come with a number of different attachment options, but the grand-daddy of them all has a scope, silencer, extended barrel, stock and laser pointer. The downside is, it’s still just a six-shooter, so there’s frequent reloading. Primary and secondary weapons vary in power, magazine size, and it’s up to the user’s preference for what they’d prefer. Just take note that some weapons require pumping or charging, and even if they have a full clip, they will not fire without pressure/charge. Bombs sum up your arsenal, and they come in two types: traditional and sticky. These, like the throwing knives, are capped at 5 for your inventory.A downside to the weapons is that you may not know exactly what it is you’re carrying. If you have a lousy memory (like yours truly), then you are out of luck for the Weaponsmith achievement, which requires getting a kill with each weapon in the game. The only time you see a weapon’s name in-game is when at a vendor. The same goes for the ammo your weapon uses. You will need to memorize which weapon shoots what kind of ammo, so you will know what to buy from a vendor later as not all guns fire the same size ammunition.Another challenge in the game is that certain areas require a gas mask, and you guessed it, your air is limited by the number of filters you have. Your mask also takes damage, so watch how many times you take a hit, you could find yourself enemy-free but suffocating while scrambling to find a discarded replacement on the wasteland surface. There are night-vision goggles available for sale as part of the stealth armor bundle from the vendors in-game, and in a few select places in the Metro itself. These are great for those who prefer to sneak their way around enemies, or those looking to get the achievements for no-kills on specific levels.Story:The story is well rounded, and it is easy to lose yourself in the world of the Metro. Your character’s home station is in danger, and you feel compelled to go out into what’s left of the world in a desperate attempt to save it. This leads you from station to station beneath the surface, fighting your way through enemies both human and non. You meet many people along the way who help you, but the world is a lethal and unforgiving place. By the end, you will have lost more than you have gained, in the way of allies, but it’s not for me to say who makes it and who doesn’t. While roaming the Metro, just remember that no one is safe.The story has two endings, however only one of them is considered canon as it is the one upon which the premise of the sequel, Metro Last Light, is based. In order to be able to choose between the two endings, you’re required to obtain a certain number of moral points. These are not explained in-game, though several guides online can walk you through how to get as many as possible to net yourself the choice. Some cannot be obtained if you choose another route (for example, one moral point might be awarded for going through a level without killing anyone, but another might be added for accessing something in-game that you cannot possibly access without getting the attention of enemies and needing to fight your way out).Summary:To wrap it up, Metro 2033 is a great buy. The few downsides aren’t enough to phase you from playing at least twice through, happily. The characters are memorable, the dialogue is realistic, and the environment is so frighteningly possible, you’ll be taking a deep breath or two just to remind yourself you’re above ground and don’t need a mask.",Predikit

Tribunal was ok (and that's all it was), but Bloodmoon is outright rotten. Almost everything about it is a disappointment...the new monsters (especially the riders) are boring and incredibly amateurish, the storyline is short and weak, the environment is completely depressing from the minute you set foot in the new area, and the performance is a joke (especially with weather, as already stated). As if that wasn't enough, Bloodmoon also takes the most unbearably annoying Morrowind quests - escorting, and completely floods the game with them (and no, the AI has not been improved). Throw in the very contrived ""werewolf"" experience, weak scripting, and on and on, and honestly, you have something that is barely at the level of quality of a free fan-made add-on. It's shocking and disappointing, coming from Bethesda. Save your money and time, and ignore this horrible money-grab. It'll ruin your Morrowind experience, make you lose your respect for Bethesda's quality and integrity, and take an unreasonable bite out of your wallet to boot. If you feel you MUST have every Morrowind expansion, at least do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin (though frankly it isn't worth even that). Unbelievably disappointing.

The aiming is precise and the freerunning is also enjoyable even if you play with keyboard and mouse. The driving, however, is not even close to finished. The cars don't behave like cars but more like bumper cars. You also cannot shoot while driving which leaves you only the hacking as defense while driving.The hacking is also one critical point. You can use the hacking feature, but don't have to. In fact, besides of some puzzles, it is much easier to shoot your way with a silenced weapon, than to hack your way through the levels.You also gain Exp during missions which gives you the option to skill more unnecessary hacking abilities. Funny, how the main theme of the game can be so obsolete.As obsolete as the hacking is also the reputation system. If you rescue people from crimes you gain reputation which as insignificant effects on your game. If you have a bad reputation, people will call the cops when they recognize you, if you have a good reputation nothing happens.The Missions:The missions are always the same: follow someone, hack into a system, jump from camera to camera with your hacker abilities and unlock a door. Then shoot everybody and escapy by car. The last part is always the scariest, because the driving is really bad.There are several side missions which consist of stopping people from reaching a certain destination, killing people, rescue people, scare people and shoot up gang hideouts.Also existent: mini games and god knows how many collectibles.Funny: the most fun part of the side missions and mini games are chess puzzles.The story:Awful. Just awful. Predictable and boring. After the first Act everyone with an average IQ knows how the story will end eventually. Ubisoft has not learned anything about narratives in the last years. It takes the topic of hacking and global connection way too serious.Overall:Much potential, wasted for the sake of making fast cash. It really has potential and I hope they will learn from this mistake named Watch Dogs and correct it in Watch Dogs 2. Currently it's not match for GTA V and can compare itself maybe to the Saints Row series.There is still a long way to go.",SoT_Jake

The game is much better once a better understanding of techniques, ascension, traveling, combat, magic, non-obvious content and travel is obtained.  It's not my favorite game, but it does provide many hours of entertainment.  Below is my original review:FF XV was my introduction into the Final Fantasy series. I would say I have a love / hate relationship with the game, but I really don't love anything about it. I did play for over 100 hours so I imagine I did get some entertainment out of it.I tend to love open world, role playing games. I would say this game is half that, and half a linear, incoherent separate story. I never grasped how the open world portion of the game related to the main story line after the first few chapters. After completing the main story line, I researched it on the web to fill in some of the blanks only to find out I had completely failed to comprehend the story line ending. But with internet help I was able to unlock a time traveling dog and return to playing the open world game. Thanks for the help, someone.The car / travel system gets bashed ad nausea, as it should. The amount of time wasted via driving / fast (slow) traveling to a point to allow fast (slow) travel to a different point was borderline comical. The car drives at a game clock speed of 1 mph and only holds about a pint of fuel.Drive to location (wait). It's getting dark (whine). Fast travel to rest area (wait). Camp (wait). Fast travel to car (wait). Walk 1/4 mile to tomato. Pick up tomato. Fast travel to car (wait). Drive back to diner (wait). Run out of gas (wait longer). Give up tomato. A new recipe!The combat system didn't do it for me either. The camera is bad to say the least. If my character out-leveled my enemies it worked best just to hold the attack button while ignoring the TV. Most efforts I made to dodge / think / control the action resulted in me performing worse. When fighting enemies that out-leveled me, the game became a button masher (attack, dodge, take another potion). I did like the visual appearance of most of the animal enemies though.I didn't care for any of the main characters. The metro boy band look, shoes 9 sizes too large, trotting around like chimpanzees, constant whining, standing around while I kill everything made me wish I could just go it alone. ""its hot...its cold...i'm tired....i'm sticky and gross....camping again....can't you catch something bigger....talk about back seat fishing...whoo hoo, bath time!"" Good god. I turned their voice volume off for a while, but then I could not hear anyone else who was so eloquently instructing me to fetch another tomato in Dukes of Hazard style southern drawl.I found the end game dungeons to be a monotonous, repetitive drag as well. How can you have the same stair case enter the same room 100 times in a single mission?Character leveling was sad. Fishing, cooking, photography and buying new boots? How does this fit with some apocalyptic story line going on in the background? I caught some world record fish though. My 300 pound grouper yielded one meal. The fishing would be greatly improved if there was some way to stifle the commentary.  It becomes grating in a manner of seconds.I was dumbfounded by the ascension tree for most of the game. I searched if for hours trying to find a way to kill Prompto. I had completed the main story before I comprehended creating simple spells as well. Maybe I am just slow in my old age.Anyway those are my thoughts. Thanks to all the web support that helped me get through this game. I was stuck many times.",JacksonAkson

It is the worst attempt at a campaign I have seen in any game, big budget or otherwise.Overall the game is fun for a few hours, but gets repetitive quicker than other FPS and without a true campaign or single player Titanfall is half the game of COD or Battlefield.

I have no intention of buying ALL the Star Wars figures or Power Disks but, so far, I've spent far too much on the Saga bundle, Yoda, Obi-Wan, Sabine Wren, and pre-ordering Darth Vader, Chewbacca, and Han Solo. $202.94, to be exact, on all of it. I can COMPLETELY understand the complaints about cost, especially given that Infinity 1.0 and 2.0 playsets aren't forward compatible.But the cost complaint doesn't make the game a zero, nor does it make the game any less enjoyable. Infinity 3.0 reminds me oh so much of the old LEGO series before Traveler's Tales oversaturated the market with them. If that sounds like your cup of tea, you won't be disappointed. My only advice is - if you're not buying for kids - stick to one specific subset of figures (in my case, Star Wars) or you'll quickly find your money going away. And don't bother with the power disks unless you ABSOLUTELY feel compelled to throw away $10 per set.I do strongly recommend the Toy Box Speedway when it comes out in October, especially if the quality is the same as the Toy Box Takeover (also available in October but given as a preorder bonus).",Captiosus

Right after doing so I bought mgs2 and 3 on a gamefly trial, and after speed playing them I felt really dissatisfied, I wanted to own them. So I considered buying them used on amazon, until i caught wind of the MGSHD collection. I decided to wait over half a year for it's release, and I am not disappointed. If you already have the games and just want to play them in HD, I don't think it would be wise. MGS2 still looks a lot like a ps2 game, only it doesn't distort or granulate when played on big expensive tv's. MGS3, however, looks extremely close to a ps3 game, but the added kicks is that it's the subsidence version so it has a bunch of added features and a controllable camera, making gameplay a whole lot less awkward. I have yet to play peace walker, but I have heard that it is the main selling point with it has much better controls and ps3-esque graphics. It also has a new, addictive multiplayer. So if you own MGS2 Substance, MGS3 subsidence, and peace walker, then you should skip this.

When you're sticking to a wall you can feel it.  It's a superb achievement by the developer(s).  There are also tons of levels, great variety in level design and mechanics, plenty of unlockables (including the unbelievably hard to get protagonist from I Want To Be The Guy, took me hours to get him), plenty of secrets... right now Steam says I have played 56 hours, pretty remarkable for a platformer.I thought about rating this a 9 for one simple reason - an extremely frustrating bug that would make certain game objects (like walls of buzz saws) move too fast to get some secrets.  I think it was a problem with the objects moving based on a fixed frame rate for the xbox that didn't translate correctly to PC.  I was able to work around it somehow - it was a while ago and I don't remember what I did - but it was EXTREMELY frustrating.  I wouldn't be surprised if this problem was patched by now though.Read my first paragraph again.  If it rings true for you then you already know you need this game.",blaow

BETHESDA!!! The game is built on the same, slightly modified engine as the first one - and it's truly is not a great engine and this game comes with problems. As of date of this review, fullscreen doesn't work - regardless what it says you are put in borderless window, GPU is not being utilized - game uses up to 80% GPU horsepower, very often far less than that, some players experience micro-stuttering on some hardware configurations. Despite it's a lot better from technical perspective than first game, I cannot ignore problems and have to take those into consideration when rating a game (-1 from rating).As for non-technical problems, voice acting quite bad for some characters (mostly side characters) and dialogue animations are straight terrible - luckily it's not RPG so there is not that much of them. Also one open zone is reused with just tiny variation and you have to dig through it twice. So this also have be reflected on final score (-1 from rating).All in all, it's great game and one you must experience because honestly it's one of the kind, especially if you like **** stories and and twisted storytelling. If you don't mind small but relatively apparent technical problems - grab it now, otherwise - wait maybe for sale, maybe they will patch thing or two until then, but i strongly recommend to any fan of genre to experience the game, it's really worth!",21grams

Strongest point of the game is the amount of content in the world. You can clearly see that devs were really fans of the game themselves. Minor details, which are like a litmus test for the depth of the game, are immense. Simple world exploration is incredibly exciting. While the main quest line is just good, secondary quests are awesome (incl. treasure hunts and witcher's contracts). Combat system is loads of fun. I remember cutting a foe in half in a fight on the bridge, just to watch his lower half tripped and fall off the bridge. Spending minutes in a spot on a map, mesmerized by the spectacular view, is no stranger in this world either. My personal favorite is the way light glows in a distance from windows during darkness. Still remember that stormy evening I first saw Novigrad walls from a distance. In fact, I have so many on such small but precious memories from this game. Nothing but love to the devs for it. I think I might buy this game once more, just out of immense appreciation. Oh and almost forgot, the game is very well optimized, which is a unique achievement in modern times by itself.A few flaws exits, however. First and for most is the jerky movement controls outside of battle, which sometimes make even simple tasks a challenge. It is a common problem arising from a console ported game. Also, on occasion, the weapon auto-draw system made me curse out loud. But on the grande scale of things, the flaws are irrelevant. This game is a solid competitor for the best game ever made.",buzzlighter

I would contrast this with bioshock infinite that is artistically very good but technically quite ordinary with mediocre texture res. Tomb raider has plently of fine detail in its realistic environments, although there are occasional places that lack detail and realism.What i liked:1. Realistic and detailed graphics2. Great menu system.3. Combat is fun. As you accumilate salvage along the way, you can upgrade your weapons.4. Skill points allow you to upgrade your abilities, and improve your combat skills etc.5. The use of natural gas to produce explosions to take out enemies.6. Creating your own zipline7. Burning arrows8. Can light things with burning torch9. Rock climbing.10. Burning buildings and fire in general looks excellent.11. No load screens, and most cutscenes can be skipped12. Lots of exploring, and fast travel to any previous level.What i didnt like or wish for:1. Laras companions2. Some QTEs3. The wolves4. It would have been nice if lara could swim like in the previous tomb raiders.5. At times, the wind can get annoying.6. Not many puzzles to solve, and too easy7.

With Nathan Drake's third outing, Drake's Deception aims to create the greatest Uncharted experience, besting it's near-flawless predecessor in every way.  In the end, Uncharted 3 falls short of the target, but that doesn't keep it from being one of the years best titles. The campaign is yet again the game's highlight. Here's the good: The cinematics and voice-acting are superb.  The characters are lifelike.  The graphics are instant eye-candy from start to finish- once you behold them, no game will look better.  The sound effects impress, and the soundtrack provides some of the best music in gaming.  The pacing is well done: gun combat, platforming, and puzzle-solving all intertwine perfectly.   The set pieces are epic, ones that Hollywood could only dream of.  However, with a campaign this amazing, it still has its letdowns.  To begin, the story isn't as compelling as Uncharted 2's.  Don't get me wrong, its a great story, but there are several elements that are not well told.  In addition, the AI are not as smart as the ones in Uncharted 2.  They may sometimes run passed you and never bother to attack, and when you shoot them, they don't react to the bullet in a realistic way. Either way, the game is still equally as hard as Uncharted 2.  Also, the campaigns re-playability isn't as strong: It clocks in at a mere 8 hours compared to Uncharted 2's 12 hour epicness. Collecting treasures return, but thats it.  In Uncharted 2, you could switch your weapon, character skins, and cheats(fast motion, infinite ammo, one-shot kills, no gravity).  These features are non-existent in Uncharted 3, a big disappointment. Regardless of all these flaws, the campaign is still worthy of endless re-playability.  But Uncharted 3 also has multiplayer.  The multiplayer has much, much more to offer than Uncharted 2.  A deep level of persistence, new game modes, and things like power plays and treasure drops make this multiplayer stand out from the competition.  You'll find it to be similar to Call of Duty's persistence and fast-paced gameplay, and while it may upset some, it really isn't all that bad.  It's insanely fun, actually. I will say that sometimes i'll play Uncharted 2's multiplayer over Uncharted 3's because it plays a lot different and can be as equally as fun. Character models are not as beautiful as Uncharted 2's, and there are still some balance issues, but its a great experience nevertheless. Overall, Uncharted 3 is an incredible game: it may not be better than Uncharted 2, but that shouldn't stop you from buying it, let alone getting a PS3.",Andrewunleashed

While I wouldn't say it's surpassed it's predecessor, that doesn't prevent it from being close. In fact, if they'd sorted out my one problem with this game, I would honestly say it's just as good if not better than Ocarina. What Breath of the Wild does so well includes; the new combat style that  troduces unique new features that the series has never seen, i.e, flurry rushing, the difficulty creates a real sense of urgency, particularly in losing battles (which you will be seeing a lot of, by the way), the artstyle really engages the player to explore the beautiful landscapes of Hyrule, the dungeons are short yet still creative, the shrines go way out of their way to reward you with only the best of trinkets in the kingdom, the story's lacking in some departments but heart-wrenching all the same, the music could've been better but seeing as they were going for an ambient-style game, I can't complain, and best of all, there is so much to do. Hyrule is teeming with detail, in animals, in your surroundings, in NPCs, literally anywhere you look you will see exactly why this game has had numerous delays over the last two years. The physics engine is genius, and the controls may be alien at first, but you settle in quicker than you think.Onto the list of flaws. As I said before, Ocarina of Time is the most flawless game ever created, and while Breath of the Wild may be amazing, it's not perfect. The frame-rate definitely has issues, the worst I had were in areas such as Death Mountain where so much was going on at once that the game actually froze for a few seconds before picking back up. I never really minded this, as I haven't ever been too big on graphics in the past, but if you are, then bare that in mind as you play. Now, my one issue with this game is regarding the antagonist, Ganon. Literally NOTHING is known about him in this game, and if you're new to the series, first off, where have you been for the past thirty years, and second, you'll finish the game wondering who it was you just took down. Ganon's objectives in this game were never explained, and this really disappointed me, especially after how deep the series was getting into story during Skyward Sword.All in all, Breath of the Wild is a near-perfect game. It's not quite there yet, but it's closer than humanity's gotten for almost twenty years.

The inventory is definitely better than it was in the first game, it's more user friendly now. (e.g. easy to compare swords, armors [luckily, there are more of these objects now, btw]) The ""Could-Be-Better"":I wouldn't say that the combat system is horrible, but it has its issues. It's more like an action game, but - fortunately -  still tactical and often challenging (however, sometimes frustrating). The AI is rather stupid at times. The foes either stand idly in front of you waiting for smashing their heads off or simply forget you if you move away a bit. The controls are reasonable although blocking doesn't always want to work properly for some reason. Besides the combat system, there are several annoyances such as:    - looting (can't pick up enemies' swords / unnecessary use of the medallion)    - drinking during meditation only    - no move while blocking    - camera issues (difficult to loot / speak)    - doors, climbing...(rather awkward and immature)    - weak stealth elements    - dice poker (I loved it in the first game so much, now I almost hate it. I think there were no need for throwing the dice manually. I barely like anything about it - physics, sounds, design of the board.)Well, these were my thoughts of 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings'. The negative side may seem huge, but these cannot destroy the overall splendid game experience. Fret not, it's a game that should be an example for many other developers.

We all know the campaign in these games are usually not good and this game is an example of that. Most of the time you can hardly care less about what's going on and you'll just want to get through the campaign already. To make matters worse, the devs decided to put some multiplayer unlockables in the campaign, meaning you have to play it if you want certain items or guns in the multiplayer. The story itself is just boring and part of that is how you, the main character, is poorly done. You never talk during the game which would be fine if you weren't the squad leader for the majority of the game. Often times you'll get scenes like a commander saying, ""I'll answer to the squad leader only"" and yet your companions will end up doing the talking for you like your a new trainee just learning the ropes and following along yet your suppose to be veteran and the leader.Multiplayer: Of you've played Battlefield 3 then you'll know what to expect. Same classes are there though some items have been mixed around. Really like that they added stats to the weapons and actually categorized so if you want a submachine gun you can just go to that. One big drawback that I don't understand why they didn't add it to the game is being able to customize your loadout while waiting for the next game. It doesn't make sense to do it while playing since you rather be playing and helping out your team rather than take time to change your loadout when you could've done it before the game started. The maps are pretty well done though, ranging from big vehicle maps to smaller no vehicles map yet big enough to accommodate a 32 and even 64 man matches.Biggest problem so far that everyone is mad about are the bugs and crashes that happened during launch. It is really unacceptable especially considering that they've had to delayed their first DLC, though I don't know why there's already a DLC, but the fact that it's been delayed shows how not ready the game was from being released.

Most game assets are pre-loaded instead of loaded on demand (and unloaded when not needed), I feel like I'm in the 90's or something. But even worse, combined with absence of fully functional 64-bit exe file this means game always crashes because of memory limits and the situation gets even worse if you naturally want to mod your game. The game also lacks some optimization as quite sometimes I experience frame drops for no fair reason - the graphics or physics in this game isn't something that anyhow should fully load your CPU or GPU even if they're not top of the line..So, for now I'm giving it a 6.

The hype and expectations for the next edition to the saga were extremely high so there was little room for error.And little error there was...The game opens with an extremely well crafted cut scene. It felt like I was watching a film and at some scenes it was hard to tell whether the characters were programed or living actors. Unlike games like Sonic 06 the rest of the game looks great too. We are not just greeted by something beautiful, the visuals last and last in true cinematic fashion.Along with the graphics the environment and world design is artistic.There is a sense of atmosphere you get while playing Halo 4. There is just the right balance between futuristic areas and natural which makes you remember that Halo takes place in the future of this universe and not in some completely new and unrecognizable universe, since there is so much relatable to Earth and our knowledge on other planets.The visuals and world design are complemented by the audio. From the Dramatic theme to the weapon sound effects this game sounds great. Great isn't one of my best words to describe something either. While Halo 4's audio is up there with some of my other top sounding games, it certainly can match with some of the Masterpieces like Half-Life 2, Legend of Zelda: Majora's mask and even Halo Combat Evolved for the original Xbox and PC. This is only a small fraction of the reason why I didn't give it a 10 out of 10.Most people complain that the gameplay in the Halo series is very repetitive and get generic as the series progresses. Having played through almost all of the Halo series I haven't really felt that there is any major repetivity. The concept has been the same throughout the series and there haven't been any minor evolutions in Gameplay but the game still feel fresh. 343 managed to keep the game new without ruining any game mechanics. It is mainly to do with the Level Design and World Design which I have already praised. There is a distinct feel to each halo game and in Halo 4 the levels are generally spread out and full of places to explore once you get past the open stage. While most area's are new and done in 343's unique styles in environment there are still one or two areas that I can relate to previous Halo titles.Halo 4's story is also a big role in creating this almost perfect masterpiece. It is a shame that most games these days, particularly FPS's, don't have stories you can get into. Most are multiplayer based and the focus on the actual game appears minimal. Halo 4 is one of the very few games that I can get into story wise. I didn't play the campaign just to get the achievements, I played it because it is good!The true reason for me to drop a mark is because of a certain enemy. That being the Knights. While I am a person who likes difficult games like CastleVania, Megaman that the more recent Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures but while playing in Heroic or Legendary the Knights are very cheap. In the games I just mentioned you are only to blame when messing up. The other enemies are like that in Halo as well and clearing a room of elites in legendary is very rewarding.The Knights are very over powered and they will only stress the player out. to my knowledge they have the same health and strength as the Elites yet they come with the assistance of bots that'll heal them besides they can heal themselves just like you and Elites can. Instead of running away from you they can teleport and by the time you find them they have or are beginning to recharge. This really becomes when there are more than one Knight around. I remember being stuck for a long time on this certain part of the third mission of the game. I have to say that part and other Knight encounters are rated high up in some of the hardest parts across the whole series and unfortunately the difficult was cheap and you never felt that it was your fault and you resort to blaming the game.The Knight is the concept to make me frown while playing this game. There are some other minor floors including some glitches but most of them have patched the only other flaw worth mentioning is the OP Mantis' but they don't bother me much at all. This leaves me to only drop one mark from perfection. 343 did an great job continuing the series. Though it may not be as good as Combat Evolved and Halo 2 I highly recommend this and I am eager to play Halo 5 when it is released.",MechaMento

Another aspect is the system of combat and ammo; For example no arrows for certain classes in early stages of the game, so therefore close encounter combat would have to be necessary for the hunter or any other class that is reliant on distant damage before closing the gap with fast strikes. Its just redundant for that class to even have close combat.

From the story, to the characters, to everything, this game is just amazing. The characters are amazing. I was a bit worried as I thought that Noctis was going to be a selfish brat, Prompto was going to be an annoying one-liner, Ignis was going to be a pompous self-centered jerk, and that Gladio was going to be a meathead, but boy was I wrong. I should have known they were going to be amazing considering that Tetsuya Nomura (from Kingdom Hearts) was going to be working on character design, but I was still worried. As I said, I was dead wrong, the characters are amazing with a different personality to each of them and they just all meld together perfectly. I actually care about the characters, and they're some of the most memorable characters I've ever experienced in any game. You can feel the brotherhood and bond that they share, whether through their actions or their dialogue. The dialogue is amazing and natural, it never felt stale or pushed. When running around the world, I feel like I'm actually talking to a friend in real life. Another thing that helps with this is the stellar voice acting. Final Fantasy games are not the most well known for their voice acting (example: Titus laugh in Final Fantasy X), but the voice acting in this game is amazing. When I looked at the IMDB page for this game, I didn't know any of the voice actors, but they surprised me as they just feel so real. Their emotions are greatly conveyed through the tone in their voice and I hope that these people pop up more often in the games industry as I love them in this game. Speaking of audio, the soundtrack is fantastic. I mean, I was expecting it to be fantastic, but it really is. Every song I loved and every song I found memorable. Another great thing is that you can listen to the soundtracks for all of the past Final Fantasy games in the car or out in the world (once you've acquired the MP3 player). The presentation is amazing as the world is beautiful and full of different environments. How they managed to make the game look so beautiful but keep a pretty solid 30fps is beyond me, but if this is the engine that they're using for FFVII Remastered, then I have high hopes for that game as this runs amazing (keep in mind I'm using the base PS4). That's also while running the individual physics on the character's hair and clothes, on the flora and fauna, so it really is impressive. Texture pop-in is very minimal which is great since it keeps you into the game and immersed. Now, that doesn't mean there isn't pop-in or weird looking textures, after all, this is an open-world game. There's bound to be bugs and glitches, but for the most part I haven't encountered many that are to make note of. The open-world is vast and has many things to do. Now, the game does get more linear towards the end, but it makes sense as it has to wrap up the storyline. Some sidequests may get repetitive at times, but for the most part they're different in their own right. You get to meet some very interesting and fun characters which is also a plus. There's missions where you take pictures, missions where you hunt down beasts, or missions where you find ores to bring back to a specific person. Each character also has specific skills. Noctis likes fishing, Ignis likes cooking, Prompto likes taking pictures, and Gladio's is survival (leveled up by just walking around). The story is great, and I'm not going to spoil it for you, but it is a very good story. Now last, but certainly not least, the new combat system. The new combat system is refined, ditching the turn based combat and going for a more real-time combat. People will have their opinions about it, but I absolutely love it and if you're a fan of the combat in Kingdom Hearts, it's a lot like that. If you want a more turned bast strategy feel, you can turn on wait mode which when you aren't moving, the game will pause and allow you to plan your attacks. Overall, this game is amazing. Everything it does, it does right. It took a lot of chances that ended up paying off in the end, and I absolutely adore this game. The story can get a bit iffy at times, but for the most part is solid, especially if you decide to watch the movie and the anime, though if you don't do that you should still be fine. The polish of the game is also amazing as well as everything feels solid. I'm gonna stop now as I need to get back to playing.",SnurgBurgler

The flow of the game is awesome, and it has some ""different"" parts to break the repetition. The upgrade system with treasure and bugs near doubled the experience. It have some sidequests, but it lacks a lot on exploration. 9,5/10.Story: Beautiful, made me cry. Full of details and deep charachters. 10/10Overall 10/10. Awesome, one of the best games on the series. I preffer a darker atmosphere on a Zelda game, and I like the exploration of game's like ALTTP (which is the best game on the series, and the best game I ever played so far), but this games brings SO MUCH in gameplay, music, graphics and story, that combined they make the greatest experience I ever had in a post SNES console. The second greatest game I EVER played.",GiPicchiotti

O game traz 15 missões que alternam entre o Master Chief e o Spartan Locke, sendo duas delas apenas com diálogos e exploração, todas as missões contam com mapas extensos e lindos, com um level design impecável, permitindo que sejam realizadas diversas estratégias diferentes contra os inteligentíssimos e até carismáticos inimigos, os gráficos são épicos, os mais bonitos que já vi em um console rodando a 1080p e impressionantes 60fps cravados. A trilha sonora é uma das mais lindas que eu já vi em um game, todas são brilhantemente produzidas e conseguem passar a melhor sensação possível de cada situação em que se encaixam.Nós temos um esquadrão que pode nos reanimar durante um tempo caso venhamos a cair no combate, o esquadrão no geral tem uma IA razoável, funcionando muito melhor quando recebe ordens que podem ser dadas por você a qualquer momento.No geral, o que tirou um pouco do brilho de Halo 5 foram os trailers divulgados pela 343, que não refletiram o produto que entregaram, mostrando até mesmo cenas que nunca vimos durante o jogo inteiro e datas incompatíveis com os fatos narrados pelo jogo.Com relação ao modo multijogador, eu sinceramente não acho que tenha jogado o suficiente pra analisar em detalhes, porém posso dizer que é absurdamente completo, com diversos modos bem diferenciados e uma extensa variedade de mapas, e que me agradaram muito, com uma ótima conexão e sendo muito competitivo. até então não tive nenhum problema quanto a isso, quando sentir que tenho mais propriedade, atualizo falando mais sobre.Gamertag: MVRQ",MVRQ
274967,The Age of Decadence,PC,10,"Age of Decadence is hands down one of the best RPGs i have ever played. Is it perfect ? No, there are a lot of things that could be better and so on. But all those things are insignificant to what Age of Decadence does.I knew Age of Decadence probably will be good RPG, i omitted early access because i didn't want to destroy my fun playing unfinished game. What surprised me was that AgeAge of Decadence is hands down one of the best RPGs i have ever played. Is it perfect ? No, there are a lot of things that could be better and so on. But all those things are insignificant to what Age of Decadence does.I knew Age of Decadence probably will be good RPG, i omitted early access because i didn't want to destroy my fun playing unfinished game. What surprised me was that Age of Decadence simply took my expectations and run away with them.So to start. I think Age of Decadence is imo game that should be classified with Mask of the Betrayer and Planescape: Torment. After finishing it, feeling i got is essentially like those games. Here story is main focus. Difference though is that in both Planescape and MotB there was central story you followed but in AoD there isn't one. AoD gives something much more important. True Role-Playing. Game doesn't pigeon hole you to one story you should follow. Game instead gives you every tool you can wield to shape your character and your future. Unlike Planescape and MotB game doesn't give you fake ""discoveries"" to make. In those games almost everything is set for you to uncover it. In AoD literally everything is for you to explore and to know and game doesn't set you on linear journey in which you will see most of the things. You can learn of secrets, rumors, events and so on and only you can verify them. Every-time you delve into some event you have this feeling that what you did is not the end and there is something more under it. This sense of unknown is what both PST and MotB didn't have and why AoD is just so awesome in that aspect.Unlike most of RPGs AoD delivers trully RPG aka Role Playing game. AoD campaign outshines even PnP RPGs in amout of options you can choose and play. Even if you would have best game master i bet 100$ he wouldn't be able to accommodate to so many options game gives. More that that we are not talking here about just C&C, we are talking here about THE C&C. There is like **** ton of choices in in AoD that completely changes things and world in game. My only minor complain is that almost all C&C don't have hidden consequences that can bite you in ass later in game (from my play trough though), usually if you have to choose something outcomes are usually short lasting and predictable.I absolutely love how game handles events. When you do something you usually are taken to scene of event instead of trekking whole city to it. This disallows preparing for combat events and you usually start in place designer wanted not where you wanted it.Story itself is fascinating. I really really really liked it. Which is achievement itself when you consider just how different one playthrough can be. I don't want to spoil anything but my character was combat oriented and story by end of it really really got interesting despite fact that i played basically murder machine with head count something above 60. Ending i got felt just right to what i did in game. It wasn't grand or amazing. It just fit my character well.This is the benchmark all role playing games will be compared to from now on.I really wish game had 2D background. Listening to this small but amazing OST really sets the tone and i feel 2D handpainted backgrounds would really really make game a lot better.I played in my playtrough as combat oriented character (literally 10ns in almost all physical skills) and i can safely say combat is really really really amazing. It is not the complexity of it but scenarios in which you fight that makes it. Always outnumbered, always trying to scrape barrel for that one right slash. It really gives you options to handle differently events in game. I often had to replay and change my tactics because something that worked for X didn't work for Y. You may not believe it but i think this gme has the most balanced combat model ever and despite that it is still fun and allows for bad rolls.Game is short but i think being short is big plus here. I finished my playtrough in ~15 hours but that time may wary probably on build you use and choices you make. Ending i got (which i wanted) was really easy to do and there were other things to do, to get different ending which could extend game. Either way game main focus is replay-ability, if game would be something like 50 hours you wouldn't replay it a lot and game literally gives you every now and then huge C&C that can completely change focus of your story. So most fun from game is those replays, to see things unfolding differently or from different points of view.When i finished The Witcher 3 this year i thought RPG of the year was already set. I think now it is safe to say that AoD is easily the best RPG of the year. It is the benchmark we will be using for years or decades and i really really really want to see AoD2. Best of all each playtrough can be completely different. Loremaster will have different starts, events and endings than mercenary.",perkel666

Yes, combat is turn-based, but it feels less tedious and more stimulating than than RPGs such as Baldur's Gate.  Elemental effects in the environment figure prominently, and are of utmost tactical importance.  Rain, water, oil, fire, heat, cold, poison, clouds, lightning -- they are present in spells, in arrows, in weapons, in the environment.  A lot of thought went into the elements of combat and it makes for a stimulating and satisfying experience.Hit your fire elemental enemies with a rain storm, which weakens them.  Now that they're wet and weak and unlikely to set your own comrades ablaze, move in and follow up with freezing spells to take them out of the action for a couple of turns.  It's a lot of fun figuring out the best way to turn the environment against your enemies.The character system is part WoW and part Fallout.  You get character attributes, abilities, and talents.  Everyone is familiar with character attributes.  Abilities are skills that you may level, like talents in WoW.  Abilities can be leveled up to 5.  Talents are like traits or single-rank perks in Fallout.  You either have a talent or you don't -- there are no levels.  It's a fair and engaging system with plenty of room for refinement.There are a few things about the game that get on my nerves, though.  I'm early in and the story seems a tad weird, even for a fantasy game.  The map could use some love.  Inventory management and crafting are inferior to WoW, although I admit they are better than Skyrim (but not by much).  I also think the game should always auto-save prior to entering combat.  Despite these drawbacks, I'm still giving the game at 10 because combat, magic, weapons, and environment are so well done.  Also, the game is stable and not buggy.  It's almost sad that I have to include that.If you love RPGs, get this game.  You won't regret it, especially if you've been disappointed by the current trends in RPGs with boring combat systems (I'm talking about you, Diablo III!)",mechanicalpulse

6617,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Switch,7,"I have super, super mixed feelings about this game. To provide some context, I have grown up playing games from Japanese RPG series, and I only play JRPG's mostly because I know I'll enjoy them, and there's too many games in the world to try with too little time, so I limit my choices to games I know I'll love - games from the Legend of Zelda series being one of them. I am also prettyI have super, super mixed feelings about this game. To provide some context, I have grown up playing games from Japanese RPG series, and I only play JRPG's mostly because I know I'll enjoy them, and there's too many games in the world to try with too little time, so I limit my choices to games I know I'll love - games from the Legend of Zelda series being one of them. I am also pretty flexible with the games I like, the FF series has changed their gameplay style almost every game, and besides the online games, I've played and enjoyed all of them. So, I have played a mix of open-world and linear games, and tend to prefer something in the middle.Before I delved into BOTW, I decided to play and beat Wind Waker HD to get myself reacquainted with the Zelda series before this game, because the last time I played a Zelda game was Skyward Sword in 2011, which I loved. And I loved Wind Waker as well. I knew this game would be a bit different with an open-world concept, though I have played similar open-world ish JRPGs before, so wasn't too worried. Though, almost 20 hours put into the game, I did not feel the same level of engagement that I immediately felt with Wind Waker just a couple of weeks before, and I decided to pause playing it.The story is not as engaging as previous titles. While the previous games pulled me in right away, I felt like I was trying to hurriedly get through the first four shrines in the beginning of the game just so I could get to what was happening. And this is the main issue I have with this game. As someone who appreciates a good story and character development in a game, the benefit of exploring a vast, virtual world in order to do so, is not appealing. I also enjoy doing side quests in JRPG's, and try to do all of them. But the side quests in here hinder me from progressing to the main story, and reap rewards that aren't very helpful. I also tend to hoard items and weapons whenever I play, and the fact that weapons and shields have to be thrown away or broken at some time, really bothers me.I love the graphics and the character design, the world is quite beautiful. I liked how the runes are incorporated and can be used pretty flexibly (though would lead me to mostly try to use bombs to kill enemies because I didn't want a sword to break or arrows to run out -_-). The method of taming horses is cool too. For me, the fun kinda stops there though. I play games to destress from the difficulties of the world, and just kick back and play through a good story, and on the contrary this game stresses me out. @_@ A virtual world can be too vast for some people, perhaps.I think I will try to beat this game at some point, but the excitement that I usually feel for a Legend of Zelda game isn't there. I could just be becoming a dated gamer (hopefully not, in my mid 20s here), but I miss the intricate dungeons, the different tools (hookshot, boomerang, etc), and most especially the engaging story and lovable characters. I think this game is more appealing to those who play Western RPGs more, though I hope the next title in the Zelda series tries to attempt a more universal appeal and mixes both linear and open world storytelling (maybe something like Xenoblade). If not, I think I will keep to re-playing the older games, which is fine with me, and stick with new games from JRPG series that release games that creatively build on their previous games without needed to transform it completely.I'm glad most people are happy with this game and perhaps are even getting introduced to the Zelda series for the first time (because it's an awesome series!! Go to the LoZ concerts!!). Though for me, this is just an okay game outfitted with the Zelda name (did not mean to make that rhyme, but it came out well). There is not much really besides the names of the characters and typical Zelda items (master sword, boomerang) that make the connection with the rest of the series, and if these characteristics are swapped out, no one would know this is part of a series, and that's really disappointing to me. For now, I'll put it down and use my destressing time to play the recently new entry of another JRPG series that I am enjoying, and get back to this one later.Overall, if you are like me and like JRPG games that put a lot of emphasis on storytelling and character development and have fun gameplay, this may not be your cup of tea. Though if you love open world games and exploring virtual areas with little direction to go through the story your own way, and don't mind doing tasks in video games w/o incentives, then you will most likely enjoy this game.Whichever type of gamer you are, how well you enjoy a game is ultimately up to you, and don't let others push you down for what your opinion is, whether you love this or any game or don't (my wise words after reading forum discussions that are virtual war zones w/ words).",eaboo316

For instance there are no iron sights, you can't pistol head shot someone across the map (If you think you can't in call of duty, youtube it), you must take down shields before you can affect players health, all guns have bloom (ridicule gets larger as shots are fired in rapid succession) whether scoped or not, as well as other differences. This makes halo have a slight steeper learning curve than other brand name shooters on the market. This helps with strategy though. More experienced halo players have more strategies beyond the usual camping, shotgun rushing, etc. One i use is the four shot with the DMR weapon. It takes four shots to the body and one to the head to kill a person. Training yourself to aim for the body for the first three shots then to move to the head for the kill will give you a much higher K/D ratio versus the spamming of the trigger I see inexperienced players doing. The larger element of strategy coupled with the player's unfamiliarity with the halo series puts a lot of new gamers at a disadvantage and inevitably leads to bad reviews. Call of Duty has strategy too, but it comes in the form of customization. Having the counters to the other person's guns, killstreaks, perks, etc. Halo puts everyone on the same playing field and forces them to become better with same the guns the the enemy is using. In conclusion, if you a serious first person shooter gamer looking for a game that has a bit more strategy in the actual gun play rather than the in game customization then Halo Reach is a good buy.",GreenTraffic

258444,Quake 4,PC,6,"This is a pretty OK game. It could be a lot better, and it shouldn't really be Quake. In the originals, the fun was running, jumping, and shooting.

Don't get me wrong, I don't look for this in a game. Only Quake and Doom games. This is too story oriented. And on top of that, the story isn't even very good. I mean, it's OK, but more than that, it's just not worth the time. Now, as for the multiplayer, it's just a copy of Quake III Arena with beefed up player and weapon models. And as for the graphics, even for 2005, it's not that great. The weapon models are cool, the textures are cool, but the character models are just atrocious. Now, I don't say ""STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!11!!1!"" It can be fun. But it doesn't hold up to the former glory of Quake from 1996. I mean, not even id Software was happy with the way Raven and Bethesda took it. So, maybe if you see it at a used game store for like $10 or on sale on Steam for $10, it might be a good buy.

Comparing it to League and Dota, its hard not to shake that feeling of casual-ness Hots ends up relaying.  Last hitting is not a necessary mechanic anymore, Talents have been implemented in place of items, and the whole slough of things just seems to hail from a time when things were simpler.Then you've played for 8 days total time in game, with 550 games under your built, have a Rank 6 account, and realize you love this game.Pros:Every character feels unique and plays differently.  I recognize this isn't hard to do when your character pool is 1/3 that of your competitors, but they've done it well so far, and you only launch with so many.  I haven't even felt the same way about any other MOBA since playing Abathur, no other game has seemed to have anything on that level.With items gone and having 2-5 choices on talents every 3 levels, builds felt limited when you first start.  once you get the hang of the game and you see that there are so many different ways to play each Hero, Talents take on a whole new level of detail that promotes conuterplay even after champ select, something the other games only touch.  Is that a enemy Valla a Siege, Anti-tank, or Burst Valla?  Is that Uther a CC Tank, a Healer, or a Nuker?  You have to actually look at your enemies talents and adjust.The maps are different.  At first this is a huge deal, providing a completely different feel to each match to the taste of 7 different flavors (8 later this month).  Once that wears off it starts to feel like the same old thing, matches revolve around ganking, pushing, and the objective regardless of the map.  When you have more experience, and especially in ranked draft play, you know the maps require you to go at the objectives in different ways.  This results in different strategies in each map.  For Haunted mines are you running a mobility team to just hit and run the objective avoiding the enemy team, or are you running a team fight group of Heroes, trying to hunt them down before they get the objectives.  These strategies vary from map to map, team to team.Cons: I did mention room to improve didn't IThe Matchmaker.  You'll read about this in every decent review.  Its currently horrible, there's just no other word for it.  Quick match is just seemingly random, you never know what kind of teammates you're going to get.  In Ranked Hero League, this problem becomes a little more prevalent.  When you're playing for keeps and you're Rank 12 with 80 games played and you got a Rank 45 with 3 games played on your team, it might not end so hot.  Or it might.  Who knows?  The matchmaker seems to be all over the place.  Hots (and most other MOBAs for that matter) uses an MMR system to place people together, but it never quite seems to do its job.Clarity:  Sometimes I wonder what Blizzard is trying to hide.  They have continuously patched their shop to be less and less accessible .  Its much easier to browse what you can purchase (both in game gold and IRL money) from hero select than it is from their actual shop currently.  When you read a Hero's Abilities and Talents from the Hero select screen, it gives you a basic understanding of what the Hero does and who they function, but the numbers are all scaled to level 1 with no information on how they scale.  So you have zero understanding of what those numbers actually accomplish until you've played the Hero at least a few times.  They could stand with a little more transparency on what exactly you get when you level up (to be fair, there are numerous sites that can show you how things scale and how numbers are derived.  Even a phone app).Last Word:  Hots, as game, is simply more fun than other MOBAs.  It is less comprehensive, yes, but don't let anyone tell you that it doesn't take as much skill.  People will say the skill cap is lower than other games, but they're wrong.  Hots merely does away with skill BARRIERS, such as having to learn each and every item and its relation to your character (lets face in League, I don't want to build an AD Nami, so 2/3 of those items are useless to me anyways).With no last hitting, we have a game that skips the laning phase, resulting in around 20 minute matches that let you have a great comeback potential.  Instead of relying on snowballing, with shared XP, the lower performers on the team are literally buffed by the good ones, yielding better results for the team compared to the individual.  As long as everyone is trying to participate with the team, that ALWAYS makes for better game play.Hots is for people who like to have fun while playing.  I love League, but I also love Hots, sometimes people feel like we have to pick.  With Hots, there is much less rage.  Thats not to say the community is any better, all MOBAs have just the worst people playing them (I know, I'm playing them), but the rage baiting is a much less significant factor with Hots, this might be its biggest strength.  Happy gaming!",drdyer89

Vistas and waypoint/poi discovering provide solid complimentary experience while levelling up and in some cases keep you up to date with your zone.  I've actually played for hours without bothering about what l am, which leads into point two.-Scaling down in lower level zones keeps you on your feet and stops the standard steamroll of lower level zones.  Even if you are a high level player you will have to pay attention when seeking completion of lower level zones that aren't yours.  Being able to assist friends that are just starting without ruining their fun is also a solid gameplay choice.-The combat itself is rock solid and feels responsive, with the ability to dodge and roll away bringing unique gameplay choices to what would otherwise be standard mmo combat.  There is some complaint about underwater combat but its such a minor issue that it doesn't deserve to overshadow anything else.-World vs World is very fun and highly rewarding.  The thrill of large scale combat is there for those who wish to enjoy it.  PVP itself hasn't been an area I've spent much time in outside of a few hours in WvW but what I have done has been rich and exciting.  There is nothing like storming through a gate of an opposing realms keep and slaughtering the players inside.  -Questing has been ingeniously dressed up to get away from the old yellow exclamation point style.  Multiple ways to complete the same quest give options for players to perform actions the way they want, not by a rigidly defined set of requirements.  -I've found myself with plenty of things to do despite several large parts of the game not being touched yet.  Auction house playing is something I usually spend hours with but they haven't even enabled that and I'm still enjoying myself greatly.  Once the launch issues are resolved the game can move forward to address its list of minor issues.  The overall feel while playing this game can't be matched except by the wonder that I got out of play the first iteration of world of warcraft back shortly after its launch.  That kind excitement hasn't been felt by me for a long time and its refreshing.  I've played SWTOR and RIFT but neither have approached the level of enjoyment I am getting right now.

One review I read somebody was complaining about the lack of roller coasters in the game and not being able to go shark fishing and docked it 2 points and gave it an 8. Are you f***ing kidding me?IMO, GTA V is arguably the best GTA and is one of the best games I've ever played. The world is gorgeous. Looking at the texture of the water while driving a boat or jet ski is just mesmerizing and fun. Or riding a dirt bike up the massive mountain in the game is great to just look at the beautiful scenery of the mountain and the wilderness. Then at the top you look down at the cities and can see buildings 6 miles away. Not to mention the explosions are fascinating to see. The lighting is insane. Walking under a tree you can see the shadow of a leaf on your shoulder almost perfectly like if it was real life. Besides a couple textures that looked a little weak, the game is a graphical beauty!The switching between 3 protagonist is revolutionary. All 3 have their own contacts, clothes they can buy, hairstyles to buy at barber shops, types of missions, skills, lifestyles, etc. I have nothing in common with Trevor who is a hillbilly trash. But he is too damn funny and interesting and I enjoy playing as him just like Franklin and Michael.The driving is way more intense and more of a racing feel than the boat like driving in GTA IV. It reminds me of Midnight Club LA in a way. The gunplay is way better than GTA IV too because it brings Red Dead and Max Payne elements together and creates intense firefights. The cover system is VASTLY improved as well and is your best friend in firefights.There is tons of stuff to do between the three characters like customize cars, buy real estate, racing, pick up nice ladies at strip clubs and streets, meet random strangers, etc, and a big huge San Andreas to explore.The only drawbacks I can think of are the car collisions, which don't deform the car as much as in GTA IV. And the popping up of the environment at certain points of the game. Some people complain about frame rate but I haven't noticed anything.To most gamers, this game is like heroin.

Fortunately Dishonored allows you to do just that.Each and every mission provides players with a number of possible solutions made all the more interesting by the different powers (that are far more than just the usual fire and ice spells so often seen) and weapons that can be found or unlocked throughout the course of the game. As a result it is possible to complete Dishonored without killing a single person or, should you choose, you can simply kick down the front door and fight your way through.Aside from the fact that the morality system is a little too black and white the main criticism I would level at the game is that it is perhaps over a little too quickly, my first playthrough took about 12 hours, but it is certainly a game I will return to and play differently at some point.

Remember that? When shooters actually were fun? Before they got bogged down in military shooters ""ad naseum"", like COD and Battlefield?

Before you had to have reflexes like a mongoose to get a kill or calculate the Coriolis effect when firing? When shooters actually were ""casual"" and for all skill levels, rather than a group of elitist jerks with too much time on their hands? When it was about up close-up mayhem and carnage rather drawn out sniping duels over miles of distance? Blizzard took a long, hard look at the state of shooters and had the courage to throw out the tropes and do something new. Yes, Overwatch borrows ideas and concepts from other shooters and games but Blizzard puts their own spin on them polishes them to brilliant sparkling gems. I haven't had this fun in a shooter for ages and it takes me back to the early days of Quake, Half-Life and Unreal Tournament, it's mayhem at it's finest. It's beautiful, polished and oh so much fun. Two thumbs up!Update! After reading some of the negative reviews here I thought I'd adress some of the, in my opinion, unfair and whiny complaints.THERE IS NO SINGLE PLAYER!Blizzard made it very clear from the start that this was a multiplayer game ONLY so whining about single player makes no sense at all. That's like going to an Indian restaurant and then complaining that they don't serve Italian food.THERE IS NOT ENOUGH CONTENT!What? 21 superbly crafted characters, 12 maps and four game modes is not enough? I'm sorry, I'll take a highly polished gem over a dinosaur-sized turd any time of the day. Quantity does not equal quality. Also, remember when TF2 was released? It only had 3 game modes, 6 maps and still only has 10 characters.THE GAME IS UNBALANCED!Not it's not. Granted, a character might need a minor tweak here and there but for the most part I'm astounded how balanced the characters are. However, one of the core concepts of this ""rock-paper-scissors""-game is that you must change character as needed during a match and a team must have a balanced composition. Only offense characters in your team with no tank, healer or defense? You don't want to change character from your precious Reaper/? Then expect get beaten, often and thoroughly and you deserve it.MATCHMAKING IS BROKENNo it's not.  And no, there is no Blizzard conspiracy to keep you at a 50/50 win/loss ratio. Game Director Jeff Kaplan addressed most of these complaints in the Blizzard forum and they turned out to be nothing but conspiracy theories and hot air. Remember, level does not equal skill.",RappScallion

Graphics are much better, nice cutscenes, pretty menues, good voice over, polished music and sound effects. Some elements were carefully added to the gameplay, but still it feels pretty much like the original game, which is a very good thing. So why do I like Runner1 better then?Today's games are often designed to be as little frustrating as possible, so that anybody can beat the game and nobody is scared off by the high difficulty. I think, that's a mistake. Runner1 had a very good level design, and there were a couple of levels which made me throw my controller against the wall because they were so difficult. Every game needs levels like that, otherwise it doesn't feel rewarding to beat it. And now for Runner2: It just took me one afternoon to finish it. Not even the final boss was particularly difficult. This is what disappointed me the most....One thing I'd criticize about Runner1 was the graphics. Often the background was full of moving, flashing things. They were so distracting that it was sometimes difficult to distinguish between all those meaningless objects and the obstacles in the foreground that would kill you, when you hit them. This problem was not solved in Runner2. In its later levels it seems even worse...If I did not know Runner1, I think I would give Runner2 a 9 or even 10/10 it is just great fun!

It has beautiful environments, engaging stroy for the 1st part of the game (more on that later), fantastic atmosphere and one of the most beautiful soundtracks I have ever heard in a video game.However, the story is not complete until you reach part 3 of the game, and to get to part 3 you have to play part 1 all over again with tiny variations (call it part 2). It's such a chore that by the end of part 2 I was completely burned out on the game. Still, I got to part 3, and after an interesting story-filled section what does the game ask you to do? Go to 3 different places and collect keys. That's right, fetch quests in the middle of the action. That completely kills any momentum the game has going. Given how atrocious the save system is in this game (you can easily lose up to an hour of progress) and cheap deaths from some of the enemies, I feel like the game simply does not appreciate the time of the person playing. So, I give it a solid 7. It's a good game with some major flaws, but it's artificially stretched and level-gated. Part 1 is a lot of fun, but if you value your time, just stop there and watch the rest on youtube.",silencer

23052,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,Nintendo64,10,"Whenever people bring up the topic of the best zelda games, the one's that hear typically brought up would be ocarina of time, a link to the past, or wind waker. However, at least in my eyes, those games do not even touch the masterpiece known as Majora's Mask. I don't even know where to begin with this one, well, maybe I could begin by talking about how it is the most unique and fun zeldaWhenever people bring up the topic of the best zelda games, the one's that hear typically brought up would be ocarina of time, a link to the past, or wind waker. However, at least in my eyes, those games do not even touch the masterpiece known as Majora's Mask. I don't even know where to begin with this one, well, maybe I could begin by talking about how it is the most unique and fun zelda game to play by far. This was the second zelda game to not take place in hyrule, instead it takes place in a world known as termina, where link accidentally got himself sent to while trying to retrieve his stolen horse and ocarina. Everything about termina eliminates anything you new about zelda games before: no hyrule, no zelda, no ganon, no master sword, and no triforce. With all of this, it may seem as though it wouldn't feel like a zelda game, but that's not the case at all.Throughout the game, link is helping a man known as the happy mask salesman to retrieve his stolen mask known as Majora's mask, and he makes it clear that you must retrieve it within three days, as he is a busy man and can't stay around for long. At first, it just seems like a fetch quest you must finish quickly so he can leave on time, but eventually you will realize this three day time limit is much darker than you could have ever imagined. I won't go any further in depth than that as you should really play the story to experience it for yourself, and let me tell you, it is one of the best experiences and best stories you will ever play through in a zelda game.Speaking of the three day time limit being dark, everything about this entire game is dark. This is the one aspect everyone knows about majora's mask, and it really delivers in that department. Every character in the game is being tortured by something terrifiying, and they all are unsure of what they should do. Some cower in fear, others refuse to leave because of uncertainty, some even accept their fate, and there are those that are still in denial. What does all of this mean? Play the game, you will find out all about its true darkness.If there is one thing about this game that is really important, it's the gameplay. This game is so much fun to play thanks to what is the greatest mechanic of any zelda game: the masks. These provide for some really awesome gameplay, as you can transform into a zora, be able to run much faster, talk to animals or the dead, or even become a super powered ultra deity. With these, the dungeons become so much fun to play through, and even platforming comes into play at certain times, which is just another reason for why I love the masks.The final aspect I will talk about is the most controversial one of all: the three day time limit. This is the aspect that turns many gamers away from this game, as they did not like the idea of playing under a time limit. But what do I'd think about it? I LOVE it. If it weren't in the game, it would be something completely different. With time always running out, everything in termina changes, whether it is the way the characters act or the moon getting much closer, it really makes the whole game feel alive. Also, needless to say, the period known as the final six hours is my favorite moment in video game history. Why is that? Well, once again, you should play the game and find out.Honestly, I could go on forever about how amazing this game is, but I think I should just end it with this final statement. Majora's Mask is not only the greatest zelda game, but is one of the greatest video games ever made. It incorporates all that I love about video games, which is just why I love it so much.",Rstiles7

Most people who submitted scores probably were Battlefield fanboys who have nothing better to do with their lives, but I'll give my opinion. Despite a few new additions to the formula, this is generally the same game that we've been playing since Call of Duty 4. This in itself can be a good and a bad thing. It is bad becauseThis game really doesn't deserve as much hate as it receives. Most people who submitted scores probably were Battlefield fanboys who have nothing better to do with their lives, but I'll give my opinion. Despite a few new additions to the formula, this is generally the same game that we've been playing since Call of Duty 4. This in itself can be a good and a bad thing. It is bad because it's not really anything unique or different, but then again, it doesn't really need to be. Pokemon, Zelda, Mario, and sports games have been doing the same thing for years, and still put out fun and great titles. The same goes for Call of Duty; while not being anything original, it's still damn fun and addictive. Also, look at it a bit more realistically. It's obviously more financially reasonable for Infinity Ward to release an addition to the series that doesn't take much work to make. It may not seem ""just"" or ""right,"" but it's smart. These are business executives, and they're all about the dollar, and hey, I'm not complaining too much, the games still amazingly fun. Sure there are still those frustrating moments when nothing is going right, you can't get a kill, and the game lags up on you and you get killed behind the corner, but these little shortcomings are far outweighed by the fantastic structure and addictive gameplay, and now with the addition of the strike packages, everyone can succeed. Support Packages are perfect for beginning players that need a bit of aid in their early efforts at becoming an expert. Assault Packages are the same awesome killstreaks from previous games, with some new editions, like the Assault Drone, Reaper, and Osprey Gunner. And last, my personal favorite, is the Specialist Package, which is for the expert players that can go on long steaks without dying. Getting the All Perks Bonus is one of the best feelings you can get when playing a game, given that you become a near invincible beast until you die. To me, most of the new maps are awesome, being headlined by Dome, Village, and Mission; however, maps like Bakaara, Seatown, and Fallen just strike me as uninspired, boring, and most of all frustrating. Last of all, the guns in the game are pretty great; however, I feel as if they added too many shotguns, where they should have focused a bit more on Submachine Guns, given that most of the maps seem more geared toward them. The PP90M1 and the Type 95 are beastly weapons that I never get tired of using. Unfortunately, sniping from Modern Warfare 3 has stayed with MW2 style rather than the more balanced and difficult Black Ops sniping. I wouldn't be surprised to see more and more people quick-scoping within the next few months. The final big addition to the game is how you can level up weapons. I think this was a marvelous addition to the game, and helped to improve your game with weapon proficiencies. Overall, the proficiencies were a nice addition, but I never found myself straying away from Kick, Range, or Attachments seeing that those were the most useful. Modern Warfare 3 is a great game, and will probably keep me and others playing for many months to come. Sure it's strikingly similar to previous titles, but as the saying goes: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""",GradGamer

123152,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,Xbox360,2,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This contains some spoilersThis game suffers from digital schizophrenia. On the one hand you have truly brilliant set pieces in tight controlled environments against intelligent enemies, and on the other MUCH larger hand you have monotonous fire fight campaigns where you repeatedly shoot the same combat armour clad bad guys who respawn just off of screen. As a headline that sums this game up quite well.I should stop at this point to say that I was a massive fan of the original MW. It came out at a time when 99% of big name console FPS releases were set squarely in WW2, it broke a trend that had led me to stop buying first person shooters because I had pretty much seen it all before. Cod4 for me revolutionised how stories were told in gaming from the opening sequence where you took the role of Yasir Al-Fulani being bundled into a car, with the player having no real idea of where you were going but having no doubt that it would be bad, to playing Sgt Paul Jackson for a fair portion of the game only to end up crawling out of a downed chinook after a nuclear strike and inevitably dying in the street, it shook up the tired formula that had persisted to that point. In MW2 these devices were evolved continued to be used with great effect. Very few of us saw our eventual betrayal at the hands of Gen Shepherd coming, I know it annoyed me when Roach was killed (in a good way) and for a game to actually raise some sort of emotion in a 'meh' generation gamer was quite an achievement. I make these points because they show how great the series has been, and they best illustrate how poor a successor MW3 really is. To get the most grating bit for me out of the way first, the story is a mish-mash at best, you find yourself jumping from body to body so frequently you never really have the time to learn the characters name, let alone care about them. As mentioned when Roach was shot and set on fire I was physically annoyed as it was my character that I'd plodded through the story with and started to identify. This time round within an hour a Russian body guard you've played as for all of five minutes cops a bullet in the chest and you barely blink. I personally couldn't care because I had no attachment to this faceless, voiceless and might as well be nameless bodyguard, for all I knew he could be a kitten strangler and being wasted was just karma catching up with him. As a side note these twist are a double edged sword, why am I forced to keep a guy alive if he's just going to die in 5 minutes anyway? In MW2 and MW3 both times this happens there are plenty of other NPC's who could complete the objective for me so why is it so important that I make it to the precise point death is waiting for me? Anyhow...Another character I couldn't care less about is Yuri, another faceless, voiceless nobody who you play through the (let's face it, better) task force 141 campaign. It seems like a real mis-step after having played the brilliantly paced back end of MW2 as Soap, to dump you in the body of someone else to view him from afar. It's not that I'm in love with Soap, I just admire the budding bro-mance between him and Price, and to have to sit as the third wheel watching that manly love blossom kills me. So that's a some of the bad out of the way (I can't be bothered to point out the obvious that killing wave after wave of identi-kit bad guys until you reach the checkpoint that magically halts their spawn gets real boring real quick) I'll move on to the good, and that is the set pieces. They are parts of this game that still have some magic left. A personal favourite was scuttling and hijacking a Russian nuclear sub, using it's missiles to sink the rest of the Russian fleet and then escaping on a Zodiac and driving (do you drive a boat?) right into the loading bay of a waiting helicopter. It was a spectacle and handled in a way that made you feel pretty bad ass, but that was ten bright, shiny minutes from an hours grey and boring gameplay. And that's why this game deserves such a low score, for every stand out moment there's 5 dull missions you drudge through as quickly as you can to try to get to them. This game isn't a revolution, it isn't even a evolution of the previous titles, it's emulation of MW's much earlier greats and that's why those calling it Modern Warfare 2.5 have summed this game up better than I ever could.",Cyrus_VII

Because Brotherhood only introduced 1 new thing, summoning assassin's, Revelations is probably my least favorite. In every game that followed AC2 they gave us maybe 1 new thing to do or weapon to attack and then took something else away. In AC3 everything changed, Connor's running/jumping/crawling style is the same as Edwards. The Tomahawk was badass my favorite. The 2 swords Edward has are the only thing different from Connor. He's basically Connor, just with plastic surgery and 2 swords. The graphics are really great, i have to say that. But overall it just isn't anything we haven't seen before, even the main story. I really miss Desmond btw, i think it's lousy we have to play as some random Templar, really makes it feel this franchise just became a moneymaking machine with no depth or anything.

I never played Destiny 1, so various complaints about how they ruined X or Y don't factor in here, as I have nothing to compare them to. I'm reviewing the game on its own merits.Pros:* The gunplay is very solid. The guns are fun to use and have a reasonable variety, but not a massive amount. It mostly sticks to the standard gun classes, but throws in some fun twists. Shooting feels responsive.* Movement feels good. Jumping feels solid, geometry is reasonable, nothing feels particularly sluggish or floaty.* Abilities are meaty and satisfying to use. Each class has three subclasses, each of which has two subtrees, giving a decent amount of customization to how you play.Neutral:* The gear is only sort of interesting. Exotics are the gear types that can heavily modify skills, and you can only have a couple at a time equipped. The loot treadmill is fun up until you start hitting moderate light levels, at which point you're mostly looking for small upgrades.* PvP seems okay, but limited. Not a lot of modes, not a lot of maps. The cooldowns concern is particularly bad in PvP, but so far I've found it to be decent, but not great.* The story is okay. Not great. Hopefully future content expands on it.Cons:* Cooldowns. Ability cooldowns are very long, and this particularly comes out in PvP. You'll be lucky to pop your super more than once or twice, and even nades/special melee come out rarely.* Communication. It's extremely hard to communicate with random people. Chat (voice and text) are both locked behind various options, making it cumbersome to communicate in the open world.* Clans. Extremely half-assed. While at launch they're broken (which I expect will get fixed), there isn't clan chat, at all. You're required to use Discord or similar to set up groups, unless you want to use their janky clan website functionality.",Elysiume

The ally actions felt like a wast of time and very gimmicky.Although the game has many game breaking bugs. Frozen victory screens, lost items rendering some objectives not completable. The game's controls are terribly and randomly mapped to keys. The mouse was absolutely disregarded during the game's development. All cursors in game have to be picked up by a secondary cursor. This is a very ugly and lazy way of dealing with not spending on PC friendly or PC specific controls or UI.

The gun combat is also very weak and guns lack impact. Overall, very very overrated.",fallouts

It gives a 3 minute demonstration on how to use your PDA, while not mentioning how to open the PDA UI at all. It leaves you to find out how to access your inventory, switch weapons, zoom in, etc etc. A pretty miserable start. Graphics are terrible from an artistic perspective (gray and brown as far as the eye can see) and from a performance perspective. Gameplay feels like a grindfest without any xp to grind out. AI is a complete joke, both of allies(which is typical of all FPS's so no faulting it there) but also of enemies. Half-Life, which was released 10 years before this game, had better enemy AI. Overall this game plays like Deus Ex's retarded stepchild, and I feel sorry for people who give this game 9s and 10s. A non-linear world does not mean an immersive world. Trudging across fields of brown nothingness breaks immersion pretty damn fast. This game does NOT have good graphics, even at top settings. Lots of graphical detail doesn't compensate for crappy art. It has the most unintuitive start of any mainstream game ever. There are a laughable amount of bugs, even if they are fixed in later patches it is still unacceptable.",JohnnyD

The game design- atmosphere, plot, character development- isn't really anything special in times like these. This would be an avant-garde FPS in 2004/5, but now it feels stale, repetitive, derivative of the old ones without innovating enough in the places it matter. For people who haven't bought a Wii yet (but have the Gamecube and played Metroid) this is not the killer app. BioShock, Mass Effect, etc games are looking much better in terms of giving you motivation to play (Gave the former a 10) instead of you playing just to finish the story arc.

I expected more.The biggest issue with this game is how the PS4's hardware weighs down the experience. Even on my Pro's ""performance mode,"" the game almost never reaches 60 FPS at all on 1080p, hovering in the 40s most of the time. This is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE for any game in 2018.

Guess I shall use them to improve my repair skill so that I can make the damn gun working again. There is something strange about this Dr. Polito though, I'm not sure I like her.------This here above authentically describes how it feels to play System Shock 2. Bioshock: Infinite calls itself a spiritual successor to System Shock franchise, but I have no idea why. It is basically a fast-paced arcade shooter. It feels very simillar to Bulletstorm. You are esentially running around, trying to dodge dozens of enemies that are after you and kill them in the process. You also collect items, but you dont actually care what items you found, you just press the [] button to pick up anything. It either boosts your health, your mana (called ""salt""), gives you ammo or money that you don't care about because there is not much to spend them for. The shooting mechanics are not very satisfying, guns have no weight and no ""umph"". You have shield that regenerates automatically once you are out of enemy fire for a few seconds and the only thing that sets it apart from hundreds of other average arcade shooters is impressive setting. And a gimmick called ""vigors"" which is a collection of a few spells you can use in combat. I found the one that possessed enemy turret (or even a soldier once you upgrade it) the most useful.Slow methodical approach is out of the question. The character moves too fast, the enemies move too fast, and overall the design doesn't allow you to play like that.Levels are perfect corridors. You can't get lost, there is no exploration. If you are not sure where to go, you can press a button to see direction (like in Killzone 2 for example).You dont care if you die, because the girl that is with you always revives you and you barely lose a few seconds before you get on the place where you died. The enemies you killed before you died are still dead, so you can basically just run around and shoot, die, and repeat (I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and there is precisely ZERO challenge in this game - if you die, you just respawn and your enemies don't, so you will eventually kill them all).The story is interesting, although a bit confusing.Overall this is a game that can be fun to play for a while and then go away and forget it. It is completely average in my opinion, but I put a few points down because it pretends it is more than it is - a successor to one of the best games of all time, System Shock 2. Well, it is not. Not even remotely. Has literally NOTHING to do with it except the ""shock"" word in the title.",NewKy

It's basically Halo for the handhelds, with some of the best online Multiplayer I've ever seen and fast-paced battles in single player with a decent story. If only people wouldn't always pick the over-powerful blue-lightning dude. I'll be playing this for a long time. Not quite as good as Prime or Prime 2, but with the addition of a very simple yet engaging Multiplayer, this is the best Metroid you'll get anytime soon.",ChadeW.

BUT it is obvious E.A had a bit of influence and brings me back to my point with this ""formula"", they deserted it and decided for MASS APPEAL rather than mass effect and i noticed this during the demo and how much emphasis was put on how one can play the game how one wishes and that the game can be toggled to suit any style, dont like stories? choose combat.. hate decisions? well you can toggle that too.. but wait, isnt that the part of mass effect which makes it like few others? and isnt that what i have spent many hours doing to have a desired and effective playthrough as well as end? was it just me or did it feel silly to scan planets this time around? as to say ""hey dont want to waste time scanning for elements, well we fixed that too"" huh? call me a loser, call me what you want BUT i enjoyed taking my time scanning for minerals and elements and launching probes with a feeling of purpose, because that was one of the many things which made me love this game, felt like what i did mattered and fulfilling. i can understand E.A 's stance from a business perspective, their knowledge and tactics of knowing that the fanbase of mass effect are going to buy this game regardless so lets find some fresh blood, but did the solid core and fan base have to feel jipped, let down, disappointed, confused and as well as angry in exchange for new profits/gains? well the core, the fans well we are mass effect. it breaths because we let it, we let it because it was great ,brought quality and emotion and stood apart from many other games and the exp was one like few others. but as much respect a game/developer may get through time can be undone in ten minutes.. i can not say that mass effect 3 was a bad game, but after putting in hours of decisions, careful choices to have it not effect anything in regards to the end , other than the war assets and ""co-op""readiness , well i feel like it was more of a ""okay hurry up and get this over with and go play co-op after"" the fact remains that mass effect 3 is still a solid game, but an ending which was promised to be the finale we dream about also being admittedly rushed well how does anything rushed ever result to anything other than sub par to par? a game is about the exp, mass effect is about a unique and gripping exp BUT the end ruined both.. its obvious a lot has changed in the gaming industry in the past 5 years, mass effect supports this in every respect, reapers went from FEAR INDUCING to PAWNS",BOSTONJOHN32

I have no prior history with the Fables series so really I just picked this up because I am a huge fan of Telltale's The Walking Dead game. They truly made the world look like a moving comic book and the dark and gritty take on classic fairy tales has me looking forward to seeing where this story goes in future episodes.Gameplay is a lot like The Walking Dead, you'll control your character and an onscreen reticle in order to interact with the environments, but action scenes have taken a notable step forward. When engaging in a fight quick-time like events take center stage. You'll move a reticle over a specific part of a body in order to attack, and dodging requires moving the analog stick in a specific direction much like in Beyond: Two Souls. These make the action scenes much more intense and because of that I feel that Telltale was free to make these scenes all the more brutal. There wasn't any real puzzles to solve in this episode which was disappointing, but the best part about Telltale's The Walking Dead wasn't always the puzzles; it was influencing the story based on your decisions.Set in a dark and mature comic book world with a noir theme, it's exciting to think about what kind of tough decisions ""The Wolf Among Us"" is going to through at us. This first episode doesn't exactly give us that great of a start in that department, which brings the whole episode down. Dialog choices are here but I never really felt like I was making a big impact on who the playable character ""Bigby"" was as a person. Every time I chose to say something that a character would ""remember"" or ""appreciate"" felt pointless because that character showed up dead shortly later. The big moments that influence future episodes also seem lacking. So far I've counted only two that will have any real effect and one of them was rather minor. Overall this doesn't ruin the episode, but it does lower the quality when compared to Telltale's previous work on The Walking Dead.Still this is an enjoyable first episode. It might not be perfect but it does get me excited to see where Telltale is headed with future episodes. The thought of making tough moral decisions in a morally gray world has me struggling to wait for the next episode. It is clear that Telltale is once again trying to improve on the groundwork they have laid with titles like The Walking Dead and Jurassic Park. If you're a fan of their previous works than I don't see a reason for you to not play this. It's a good start to what is hopefully a great game.",TheQuietGamer

Action could be a lot of fun, too bad you only have one button to crouch, run, and jump over obstacles. Most of the times you'll die it's going to be because of this. Some good moments about the plot, but some errors and contradictions are very easy to notice. The soundtrack, that's probably the only thing that really went right. Given all this facts I'd give it a 7/10 BUT: the ending. The plot becomes meaningless, all your choices: discarded. The explanations are incredibly dumb at best, and even if you assume it was all just a dream, or an indoctrination induced vision, it keep not making sense. Even if it did, you still don't see what happens to the galaxy you learned to love in the course of three games. What you get is the same cutscene, with an explosion of a different color based on a choice you make in the last 30 seconds of gameplay. This is no hyperbole, it's actually what you get. The whole plot is based on something the devs explicitly said they would'n do: add a ""kill reapers"" button. They aren't even above adding the cliche child dying seeking some easy drama, and getting shepard out of character a bit more.  I'd make it 4/10 then, even with no reasonable plot it's still a nice action game with some control issues and a few good moments with your old companions, right? No, because a game is not just the final product. Everything reeks of the scent of some money-craving horrible beast. You get day one DLC that is already on disk. That character was intended to be meaningful to the plot, and you can see why: it's a prothean. But they just accepted to sacrifice some of the plot meaningfulness so that it could be an optional you could sell. As you finish the game, a message appears: you are reset before you start the last mission, and you're invited to buy some DLCs to further shepard's adventures. This behaviour is unacceptable. Remember when DLCs were stuff they made months AFTER the game was released, and you got to play THE WHOLE GAME simply by paying its price? Maybe it's me, maybe I should't have standards. But I do, and so do many people. That's why after a second playtrough I'm modifying my review and giving this a zero. That's why this game has such a low score.

Great writing and plot, interesting combat mechanics, great crafting, freedom to interact with pretty much anything and a ton of content make this a joy. The game is challenging and takes time and thought, so may not be for everyone, but if you like old school RPG's and enjoy a challenge, then this is the game for you!",Bombzy

Honestly, every part of it is brilliant.Let's start with the single player. It's short, yeah. Everyone has come to expect that from the Call of Duty franchise. The campaign is filled with Michael Bay style set pieces, and cinematic moments that will be stuck in your mind for years to come - much like previous moments in Call of Duty 4, and Modern Warfare 2. The campaign delivers a sweet ending to the Modern Warfare trilogy, complete with epic moments, and emotional moments. The game really leaves me wondering, though - What is next for Infinity Ward?Once you've completed the campaign, you've got Spec Ops to look forward to. One mode is similar to its MW2 predecessor - going through moments from the campaign with different objectives, completing them by yourself or with a friend, either on Xbox Live or in split screen. And now, you can even search for people to join you if you're lacking in the friends department. However, Spec Ops is more than this now. There's the newly introduced Spec Ops Survival mode, that puts you and a partner against waves and waves of enemies, ranging from your run of the mill soldier, to dogs with C4 strapped to them. This mode also comes with the ability to rank up, unlock new weapons and killstreaks, such as calling in a Delta squad to assist you in taking out Juggernauts. Overall, this mode is a masterpiece from Infinity Ward.Multiplayer, the piece of the game that the majority of players only care about. The internet has been littered with haters screaming, ""It's the same game!"" Well let me tell you something - It's not. This game plays very differently to MW2. Sure, it's the same style as all of the previous Call of Duty's, but that's because it's a sequel. Infinity Ward would be stupid to go out and completely redesign Call of Duty, when they've got a formula that is almost perfect, and the game increases in sales every year. Packed with new features, weapons, equipment, and maps, this game is definitely huge.Modern Warfare 3 is definitely the most balanced Call of Duty to date. As well as that, it is also the most fun, the most action packed, and brings the most content to the table.In conclusion, this game is so packed with content that it will take a long time until it's forgotten about. Is it revolutionary? No. Does it need to be? No. The Call of Duty series shows no signs of dying, and you're in denial if you think it is.",Brandaman

One of the downsides in the game is how much luck plays into your races. When racing on 150cc, you will be constantly bombarded by Blue Shells, POW Blocks, and the like. It can be really frustrating and may ruin the experience for some.The game more than makes up for this in the quality of its courses. While some of the retro picks are questionable, the new courses are simply amazing. Standouts include Maple Treeway, Koopa Cape, Coconut Mall, DK Summit, Dry Dry Ruins, and Rainbow Road. The latter is an extremely tricky course and can be difficult to master.Overall, Mario Kart Wii is an enjoyable experience with fantastic courses, multiplayer, and reparability but the items can be a bit too harsh and luck-oriented.

The game nails its gimmick, the grappling hook. Thinking of games with a gimmicky weapon, the grappling hook in ""Just Cause 2"" is up there with the Portal Gun. The grappling hook is just that good. It is so good in fact, that it turns a bad game good.Before I mention what is fun, let me tell you what is not fun. Enemy a.i. with x-ray binocular vision. You need a sniper rifle to accurately fire off a shot at the edge of the draw distance. The enemy a.i. can not only spot you instantaneously, they can also accurately hit you with machine gun fire. They can also spot you through foliage and through buildings. Fortunately, this game not geared toward stealth. The manual says to dodge and find cover to avoid gunfire. The developer forgot to actually make either of those two options work. In a pinch, your best bet is to either run away or lay waste to your enemies with a machine gun.The machine gun is the only good weapon in the game. Forget head shots. Forget stealthy sniper kills, the game doesn't have stealth anyway. Forget creative use of the grappling hook. While you are setting up grappling hook kills, your enemy is drilling you down with 100% accurate machine gun fire. Just put all your weapons part into the machine gun and go crazy.The other not fun piece of the game is searching for things to blow up and crates full of weapon and vehicle parts. Sometimes, too much is too much. Searching for this stuff is just too much. Fortunately, most of the locations are so similar, as in copy and paste similar, that finding stuff becomes second nature. On the down side, most of the locations are copy and paste similar.Now the fun stuff. Grappling enemies to just about anything is fun. Helicopters, jets that are taking off, cars, trees, and each other. You can pull them down to their deaths, and also also up to their deaths (head injury alert!). You can pull down statues, lift vehicles and objects, and create utter mayhem. The grappling alone is great, but the developers paired it with a backpack full of infinite parachutes, letting you take off any time you desire. Brilliant.Driving and flying is also fun. This game gives you access to attack helicopters with machine guns and rockets and then lets you lose in a world of objects you can destroy. My complaint here, not enough stuff to destroy. You can't for instance, destroy whole buildings. How about Frost Engine style destructables? Planes and jets are also fun, but too difficult to control and hit ground targets with. Perhaps if the developers had pointed the weapons down a bit, then my jets wouldn't collide with the earth so much. Tanks are simply wonderful toys.The grappling hook makes the game here, and that's why the score is 8 out of 10. Otherwise, the shoddy a.i., limited desctructables, and cookie cutter design would make for a terrible game. Lets hope for a better ""Just Cause 3"".",bioadam

You didn`t have to do it that way, you could clear it with skill or use a combination – the important bit here though– it was up to you. Unfortunately the developers decided to change that, so you can only “farm” monsters for a set number of turns – then they disappear, unless you make the game harder ofc. Unlike the former games  where you`d progress a little bit every time and eventually beat the level - Dark Souls 2 robs you of that “triumph” or “revenge kill” – because – reasons.The lock on is worse than ever and if you`re a magic user, the range is set to whatever gets your opponent within striking range, so sometimes it`s 5 meters, other time`s it`s longer or shorter – what a joke.The game seems obsessed with your demise, so much so there`s even a monument that displays the numbers of deaths you`ve suffered so far. If you die a lot, then that`s good – right. If you die twice as much as Demon souls, then this game is twice as good – right? The combat is also severely unbalanced. You either destroy the enemy without a scratch or you`re likely dead – There´s no middle ground in this game.

Some of these locations, like Fort Frolic, are memorable in design, while others, like Arcadia, feel bland. There is a good range of Plasmids to choose from, though, which allows for different ways to attack enemies. The penultimate escort section of the game, however, feels tedious and forced in to lengthen time, and the final boss is a bit of a letdown, compared to how much the game hypes it up. The game is great at setting atmosphere, though, with it's use of sounds, and the stylistic posters and pictures of some locations also help to increase tension, such as with Sander Cohen. A good game, with some missed potential.",ashketchum

You can customise your Sims pretty much however you want, you can extend their life to ages and ages or move through generations quickly, build awesome houses.

140441,Diablo III,PC,1,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I'm very disappointed in this game.Story -  Killing Cain? Come on now. How can the consistent character of ALL DIABLO'S just die during the first act? I imagined Cain to be more heroic, maybe a sacrifice in Act 4 to save Leah that traded his soul for her life. That would have been amazing, but the only sacrifice we saw was Tyreal becoming a (useless) mortal. He didn't even do much to arrive and help.  Also, Leah was beautiful and while I was getting excited for her character development, she just turns into Diablo and we melt her face. Thanks Blizzard for creating a main character that added nothing to the experience. Gameplay - The game is very tedious, you're just farming & buying on AH. The excitement to pick up a drop/identify an item was not the same as WoW or D2. As I got to Hell Act 2, I started hating the farm + AH combo, didn't even want to deal with that for leveling another character. The character progression has been simplified to the point that any idiot could play, with 4 button & 2 mouse, there wasn't much of a plethora of options/abilities you could roll out. One of the joys of D2 was having a huge inventory of spells that could be cast for different situations, we're fed a 1-dimensional skillset.Cinematic's - Great quality, blizzard never disappoints. That's why I gave a solid 1.Games nowadays have evolved so much, that our expectations are through the roof. Here is a list of games that were better: Dragon Age, Skyrim and WoW. I'm sure there are more.",tabion

38202,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,Xbox360,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        9.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 10).Call of Duty is the definitive videogame cash cow. It is basically the Micheal Bay of gaming. There are plenty of explosions, the budgets are gigantic, they make a tonne of revenue and most importantly, they haven't really innovated in 2 years. Most of these claims can be laid at the feet of the game that started it all: Modern Warfare. In all fairness, I doubt Infinity Ward even thought about the large amount of sequels that could potentially follow this game. After all, everybody thought that a modern shooter wouldn't work- that it would fall apart after so many games spent in WWII. That never happened.The single player campaign of MW popularised the approach to turn FPS narratives into globe trotting linear levels, that go through dozens of set pieces in less than 6 hours. Off course, this is the real negative of the game. The plot can't sustain pace all too well and so you'll have this wrapped up in one really long session. But that doesn't mean it sucks. The bombastic campaign is set piece after set piece, with an epic ship infiltration, a tank driving sequence and a kinetic car chase all making the cut. Of course there is also the iconic ""All Ghillied Up"" Sniper level which sees you sneaking through an abandoned city with one ally and plenty of soldiers after you. It is still the greatest FPS level of all time. The levels aren't open at all with funnelled corridors making for the most interesting environnments, but this linearity suits the game. It has been criticised for this in more recent entries.The story is one of the best in COD history, as a mysterious Russian villain begins to cause widespread havoc, even though the instantly likeable Captain Price thought he had assassinated him years ago. You take the role of John ""Soap"" Mactavish, a new recruit who just wants to prove himself. Multiple twists and turns are taken and the use of multiple roles (even if Soap is the main character), helps to flesh out the story. A particular level uses the first-person perspective in a genuinely disturbing way. The killing of certain characters also helps the player to develop a strong emotional feeling, even if this is the first installment.The game is designed with a high level of replayability in mind. There are multiple difficulty levels and an addictive Arcade mode. In fact, the epilogue level of the game that comes after the credits is probably one of the most replayable levels in gaming history. The campaign is so inviting that you will want to go back and play through it again. The short length is certainly a detractor, but collectibles and achievements certainly add more time to the experience. But enough about single player, because multiplayer is the main attraction of Modern Warfare.The modes are excellent. From Team Deathmatch to Capture the Flag, there is a wide range of variety on offer. This means that investing hours into the mode won't get repetitive like it does in other shooters. The maps are fairly large, but certain ones are designed to be tiny. The close quarters feel is what makes the COD MP so unique and that is firmly established here. The ship map that is ripped from the campaign is a particular campaign, but most of them are instant classics and the DLC helps to increase the amount of environments on offer. It may not be as dynamic as Battlefield, but it certainly is more polished and more approachable. The slick gunplay and easy control scheme are perfectly suited to the game. This is further advanced by the quick use of gadgets and the fast switching- this may seem like a small compliment in these days, but back 7 years ago, it was revolutionary. So was the levelling system and the constant influx of new weapons and gear. It plays out like an RPG online and that is truly an amazing advancement. THe scoresteaks and perks are fairly outlandish in such a grounded setting, but they still work to make this an unpredictable and exhilarating experience.So Modern Warfare is responsible for plenty of annoying things. Short campaign. Check. Lack of open choice and environments. Check. Campers. Check. Twelve-year olds with screechy voices. Check. Yep, this popularised pretty much what everyone hates about the genre. If you look past its damaging legacy and embrace it for what it is, you'll get the third best Call of Duty out, just behind BLOPSII and MW2- but that's my opinion.",EzioA88
152840,Pokemon X,3DS,10,"Having played (and owning) every other cartridge in the series, I feel that I'm fairly qualified to make judgement on this game.  This is the ONLY time that I have only purchased one of the released pair, mainly because I only have 1x 3DS console (the kids have one each, but I normally have 2 for trades and breeding etc).  Anyway, I've logged about 10 hours of gameplay into this Pokemon XHaving played (and owning) every other cartridge in the series, I feel that I'm fairly qualified to make judgement on this game.  This is the ONLY time that I have only purchased one of the released pair, mainly because I only have 1x 3DS console (the kids have one each, but I normally have 2 for trades and breeding etc).  Anyway, I've logged about 10 hours of gameplay into this Pokemon X game, and i must say I'm very impressed with the graphic and sound upgrades.  The musical tunes seem a lot more dynamic than the last two offerings, using more sound 'voices' to bring the music to a more refined tone.  This game is one of very few that I actually play the game with the sound on, and last night, I even had my headphones in so I could enjoy it louder.  That said, I wish they were able to merge the sound effects into the main track when leveling up etc, as that mutes the music to take focus.The graphics:  I quite like the larger view from the older 'sprite' styles used since 1998.  Don't get me wrong, that little character was instantly recognizable to any fan, but this is much better on my eyes.  Since I'm probably the oldest Pokemon gamer (39), I feel that gamefreak/Nintendo are trying to branch out in to a more mature gaming body.  It looks almost Zelda OoT style during the normal walking around.  The 3D feature is only active during battles, not that I care as I have my 3DS-XL's slider all the way down in 2D mode anyway.  I did take a look at the 3D just for kicks though.The gameplay:  The tried and proven turn based RPG.  The reading is not that difficult and nowhere near as over the top as previous games either.  It's nice to hear some Pokemon having their own voices, and not the weird white noise generated.  Pikachu is a standout for that!Anyway, enough of this rambling!!!  I'm heading back to catch a few more of the little beggars!!!",KegRaider

193338,Chaos Reborn,PC,10,"TL;DR: I enjoy this game immensely. This review summarizes some reasons why.THE THEME: At the end of the 14th century, Earth shattered into innumerable fragments in a magic-instigated apocalypse. Powerful magic allows fragments of Earth to endure as habitable, island realms scattered between planes of existence. From a planet called Limbo, wizards and gods engage in eternal conflictTL;DR: I enjoy this game immensely. This review summarizes some reasons why.THE THEME: At the end of the 14th century, Earth shattered into innumerable fragments in a magic-instigated apocalypse. Powerful magic allows fragments of Earth to endure as habitable, island realms scattered between planes of existence. From a planet called Limbo, wizards and gods engage in eternal conflict over who controls the many, surviving realms of old Earth. Each realm holds the promise of ancient artifacts, lore, and power to fuel the ambitions of wizards and gods alike. It is a feudal, dystopic society of magic users.THE DEVELOPER: Chaos Reborn is a rebirth and reimagining of Chaos: The Battle of Wizards (1985) and Lords of Chaos (1990) by their original creator, Julian Gollop. Mr. Gollop is more known for creating the original X-COM: UFO Defense (1994), the widely acclaimed classic which inspired XCOM: Enemy Unknown and many other games. The classic Chaos and X-COM games were rooted upon deep, tactical play. Chaos Reborn is a true successor to both legacies.TACTICAL GAMEPLAY: I cannot really do the basic gameplay experience justice in a short paragraph. It has too many tactical layers. But at essence, the game involves duels of up to 4 wizards. Wizards can invoke flamboyantly magical spells and summon creatures. Yet wizards themselves are fragile and must be protected. Imagine a three dimensional, multi-layered game of wizard chess with variable numbers and types of pieces which can come and go, and where each attack has a very real chance of failure. But if you lose the wizard, then you lose the game. Sometimes you will lose despite your best efforts, and sometimes you will win because you were lucky rather than good. That said, this game is tactically deep and, over time, rewards players who come to understand and appreciate all of the many, varied tactical approaches to gameplay.TUTORIAL: There is a tutorial labeled “Wizard Training” in the main menu. It comprises a series of gated set-piece encounters which gradually introduce you to the fundamental mechanics and tactics of the game. Having played the game for hundreds of hours before experiencing the tutorial, I still found it enjoyable. It’s not often that I can say that about a tutorial.ONLINE MULTIPLAYER GAME MODES: Multiplayer wizard duels can be played live or asynchronously with up to 4 players. Matches can be friendly or ranked. And matches can be played Equipped (with custom equipment) or Classic (with standard equipment). Ranked matches allow you to qualify as an ""Archmage"" at which point you will be given your worldwide rank computed by an ELO scoring method. League standings reset in monthly seasons. Whether friendly or ranked, matches generally go quickly. As for the asynchronous games, these are my favorites. You can have up to 20 asynchronous games going at any time. Each player has many days to complete their turns in a match, but I find matches generally go more quickly than that. After ranked matches were first introduced, I completed 35 ranked async matches in just 3 days, and this was gameplay I managed in bits of free time that I had rather in continuous sittings. (I love, love the asynchronous functionality.) Additionally, players can create custom private, friendly matches, changing the parameters of the game.ONLINE SINGLEPLAYER/COOP MODE: There are developer and player created Realms of Chaos which you can explore online with your wizard. These Realms vary in size and challenge and come with a rating system to help determine which are worth exploring. The essential aspect of this game mode is to explore the map to find and defeat all of the Wizard Lords (AI-controlled mini-bosses) in order to reach and defeat the Wizard King (AI-controlled boss) of the Realm. While you are doing this, the Wizard King and his Wizard Lords summon reinforcements. And if you take too long, the Wizard King can banish you from the Realm. This game mode should not be considered a full-fledged RPG. Think of each of the Realms as puzzles to be solved, and some have stories to tell.OFFLINE HOTSEAT AND SINGLEPLAYER GAME MODES: There are offline game modes which allow hotseat gameplay against any combination of human or AI-controlled opponents.GRAPHICS: The game uses the Unity game engine, which should be compatible with most computers. The custom art and animations are quite pretty. And the game really does have its own, unique graphical theme. Don’t rely on me for too much input on this, as I was playing the game when wizards and creatures were represented by crude, unanimated placeholder graphics. But if you really care about graphics, the graphics are good.IN SUM: As-is, the game is a gem. If you like tactical turn-based games, then spending $20 on Chaos Reborn will get you one of the more fun games in your Steam inventory. If you’ve read this far and the game still intrigues you, then you should get the game.",NoWorries

The mastery system itself is ACCOUNT WIDE and once you finish the initial acquisition of necessary masteries it's extremely alt-a-holic friendly.People expect to get everything from day 1 and a lot of these ungrateful reviews stem from the entitlement not realizing that they are already playing a MAX LEVEL character and are just unlocking stuff (e.g. explorable areas, alternate job classes [calles elite specializations], story, etc.] BY PLAYING THE GAME. It's not even gated behind a paywall (aside from buying the expansion of course) and the exp required to unlock the minimum requirement of masteries to complete the story mode and a lot of the areas isn't even that high.I'm not a ""hardcore"" gamer that can waste 12-16 hours of my time in a game, I work and have a life. At max I can play 2 hours on weekdays and 8 hours on weekends and EVERYTHING is attainable even at my snail's pace. The people who complain about ""grind"" and leave extremely negative reviews are uninformed, entitled, and spoiled players who've never actually experienced a true grind like those who have played other MMOs such as World of Warcraft, Ragnarok Online, TERA, etc.For a first expansion Heart of Thorns offers three important things:1. Extremely creative and challenging new content.2. Very good replayability.3. Beautiful gameplay which encompasses all the new mechanics, story, areas, and experience.Heart of Thorns is a beautiful, well thought out, and extremely passionate expansion with a lot of HEART and SOUL put into it. Everything provided was beyond expectations and the people who complain about a SINGLE aspect of the game that are LARGELY BASED ON ENTITLED OPINION (thinking that HoT content is gated behind grind oriented mechanics) and give unfair review scores like 1 or lower are extremely biased and obviously lacks credibility. Game content exists to be COMPLETED after all. If everything is provided at the get go then there is no point to a game at all.TL;DR: - PROS: Great and a LARGE amount of content, great story, great gameplay, great delivery, by far the SMOOTHEST first day of expansion launch for ANY game that I've ever played, extremely well balanced challenging content, beautiful maps and areas, creative alternate job classes.CONS: Shattering the expectations of ENTITLED and SPOILED PROFESSIONAL CASUALS (a derogatory term for people who expect to get everything from day 1 without actually playing the game) due to being put into a state of laziness due to the nature of core content alternate character leveling (Tomes of Knowlege) and the easiness of acquiring content in the base game due to cumulative and collective wisdom and knowledge of the community from playing the base game for 3 years.",Evaara

First if you're familiar with theTales From The Borderlands have every quality you would expect from an interactive series, because yes, if you're not into this kind of experience, half-way between traditional videogames and movies, do not buy any Telltale game.Now if you're still interested by this review let's go back to the qualities of this particular game and they are many. First if you're familiar with the Borderlands franchise you may wonder how an open-world game based on loot and co-op will be when very story focused. Well it was awesome, the guys from Telltale truly respected the work made by Gearbox with many references and characters from the previous games and a main story that follow the events of Borderlands 2 providing new awesome characters (I hope some of them will be in an expected Borderlands 3), they also keep the same graphic art than the original games, which makes Tales From The Borderlands the best looking Telltale game by far.The five episodes are full of hilarious jokes, epic and moving moments, the wait between each episode was very long thanks to nice cliffhangers, it really was an intense experience, you'll never be bored playing this game. My only complaint is that (like most Telltale games) choices have only minor repercussions, all the big events stay the same, but hey at least there is some changes.Finally the length of the game is pretty reasonable, approximately 12 hours for 20€/$ it's cheaper than 5 movies in a theater (in France at least) or many videogames sold 70 €/$ and sometimes shorter. Tales From The Borderlands is the best game Telltale made since the season 1 of Walking Dead and is a shiny example of how great an interactive story can be.",BaronMonaco

At that point you want to just get the mission over with in order to advance the story. Also, the controls (At least for the PS3) are a little clunky and sometimes can hinder your playing ability.

Apart from a few pacing issues here and there (and general repetitiveness), this game is addictive and unique. The cast of characters and story, plus the addictive and rewarding game play makes this game shine. Yes it does get repetitive, but the rewards whether that be for the perks for hanging out with friends, or grinding for better personas, the repetitiveness for me was worth it in the long haul. Plus the majority of the side stories (hanging out with confidants) are truly interesting. Now the core gameplay consists of traversing about 8-9 dungeons, each truly unique and different from each other, until you reach the end boss. Combat consists of turn based gameplay, you either grind away or target enemies weaknesses, forming your own team of ""personas"" (or pokemons per say) and controlling what skills and fight moves you want. It's a lot of grinding but again to me it's also rewarding and addicting. Difficulty is about average even a little easy if you know what you're doing, but some bosses do present a  good challenge. The only thing I truly hated about this game was the chatting after finishing each dungeon, sometimes it takes me a couple of hours of ""cutscenes"" to advance to the next dungeon to progress the story. But overall as a newbie to jrpgs,  I truly enjoyed this game, so much so I bought a vita to play persona 4.

279782,Watch Dogs,PlayStation4,0,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This game deserves the award for WORST game of 2014. I gave this game many chances, too many. This will be a review from somebody that has not yet played GTA V, so calling me a GTA fanboy is stupid.The first second that you start playing the game you will notice that graphics are ugly compared to the E3 presentation. I'm not a graphics guy, but I have a huge problem with liers. Don't showcase a game if you can never achieve graphics at such a high level.Also you will notice very fast that Aiden, as a character, is just not interesting. It's also a stupid story that gets used in almost every open world game these days: Your niece gets killed, and you're out for revenge. That's it. The whole story. It's not even a long story too, with the most boring characters I've ever seen. Jordi for example. What's the point of him? He gives you sticky bombs at one point in the game. Yeah, nice, thank you for that, what else? The only 2 characters that I liked were T-Bone and Badboy17 (Clara). I won't even start explaining why the ending is just god awful.Who was in charge of the driving mechanics? Fire that guy, please. It sucks when you need to chase down a guy (wich is pretty much 70% of the missions in the game), and the horrible driving mechanics fck you over.And this is something that I never saw somebody talk about: The civilians and the reputation bar. This is the part where I'm really angry. What's the point of getting points for actually killing a criminal, when the civilians still send cops after your ass because you shot a gun? I know that taking them down is better, but if there is no other option and you just don't want to chase the guy for decades? My bar was all the way to the right (good reputation), but I gave up and I just started to play bowling with my car as the bowling ball and the civilians as bowling pins.And hacking makes it so this game is not a challenge at all. It's so easy to get away with a 5 wanted level. I had a hard time escaping a 5 star wanted level in GTA IV, but not in W_D.TLDR; This is a boring game that does nothing right. Mix of GTA, Assassin's Creed, and Saint's Row (side missions). Don't believe that hype, kids. Ubisoft belongs in my list of worst video game developers, with EA. Good marketing though.",XzRecolz

Respawn Entertainment, Infinity Ward and Activision have basically spent the last several years just suing each other left and right over the IP (royalties, rights to make new games, competition). Bottom line is that Treyarch is still doing what they've always done, but they flounder without the assets/tools (game engine/graphics/mechanics) that the franchise founders created for them. Treyarch doesn't know how to make new tools, so they have had to use the same ones over and over since MW2 (many would say MW1).And... that's why we can't have nice things.",PlayerReview

The MISSING ending(!) is definitly the greatest story-telling/marketing/... twist in the history of gaming. I think Indocrination Theory nails it, and the negative fan feedback has been anticipated by BioWare in order to gain general media attention. Marlk my words, I'm 100% sure the ending DLC is ready and is soon going to be released.That alone would be worth 10+, even hough there are some minor issues with the game like: * the cover/run/look-aound-the-corner functionality getting mixed up at times * coop matches where you suddenly can't reload or do damage any more* some formerm team mates just being ticked off (i.e. there's no real story for some of them)* combat is too easy even on insanity * most of the missions are too short (shorter than ME2 missions)But ME3 is also the first game ever to make me cry (Mordin humming his song...), and all the bigger parts of the story (Tuchanka, Geth/Quarians, AND THE ENDING) work really really well.",Zoso

Year after year these so called AAA+ games repeat the same game mechanics and contain only minimalistic improvements with a bit more details than the last incarnation. We get the same games with a slightly more polished production value. So you can guess how eager I was to try out the re-released ICO & Shadow of the Colossus bundle. Not only because the great reviews they received back in the days, but the reviews combined with the promisingly different gaming experience. So, now I'm thinking it was either the hype that got to me or people are overly nostalgic. Because, boy was I disappointed (again) when I put the disc in... If I had to describe these two games with one word, it would be ""boring"". Another would be ""artistic"". I felt no suspense, excitement, challenge or plain old fun when playing either of these. Just... bored. SOTC seemed vastly hollow content-wise and ICO too easy and straight-forward. However, I think I understand why these games are held in so high esteem. They do have an enigmatic story going on, a distinct goal, and take place in a simplistic yet unique world. Now, if you're one of those persons who can forget the lack of degree in the gameplay and just let yourself immerse into the game world, this game's for you. Didn't work for me though, I put the box back into the shelf after playing for only two hours, and this kind of rejection hasn't happened to me for a very long time!

The game is never boring, the is lots and lots of freedom. ==================GRAPHICS are just amazing, little different than say Crysis3 but imo definitely on par with it. The grass is thick and beatiful, the bigger plants move when you walk or drive through them, the trees move when you shoot them. The water is great, there are plenty of animals  even regular fish under water. The island is absolutely beatiful, even with the HD6950 onboard, because optimisation is great. The effects  sunlight reflexes, flares, smoke, explosions  everything beatifully made. ===================SOUND and FX is top quality. The guns feel real, the animals roar, growl wuf and whatnot. The birds are singing. The vehicles all have authentic sounds that differ depending on which you drive. Every bit of the island is different  there is not a single village or outpost that is the same. Finally, the protagonist has a nice voice, has a LOT to say through the game. Along with the graphics all this make you feel totally submerged in the story and want to explore every meter of the island.=======================GAMEPLAY is especially clever here. The AI is very good, the guns all feel different and shooting is satisfying, even the driving never gets old. There are lots of cars and hanggliders so the player never has to walk for hours (be sure  the island is HUGE). The distances to every quest are just right so you never get bored. IF you don`t want you can fast travel any time you want. There are lots of home posts to rearm and heal. The collectible items are fun to explore for, the caves are very nice. The skill and crafting system is the single best thing in this game. You can get the skills or craft items or no  your choice. The takedowns are very cleverly made, easy to learn, effective so you often will chose the knife instead of the guns.Finally here you do not have to shoot a guy with half the magazine to kill him, one bullet is often enough. The guns are plenty customizable, very satisfying to use different variants. There is not a single thing about the gameplay I did not like.============================SP CAMPAIGN is quite long, very clever for a FPP game, fun to play. The antagonist named Vaas is what drives you through the story. Other characters also feel alive and authentic. The flashbacks are very nice to see and play. The missions are very much varied and provide fun, emotions, dialogues, humour. Extraordinary quality for an FPP game, almost as ambitious as an RPG. And you do not have to do this  it is your choice when and what you do. Overall  this game owns Crysis series in every way possible, providing wonderful gameplay, beatiful optimised graphics and a good, well written lots of different things to do and a fun main story. Worth every penny of the 60 dollar price tag.",MustisTheCat

52640,Mass Effect 3,Xbox360,0,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I played all three games and this one made them all turn bitter and useless. The first one gave me true exploration and an uncharted galaxy in which I had full control and repercussions for my actions. Real effects and sacrifices. I was in full control of every aspect of my character, his weapons, class, armor, decisions, even right down to his face. In essence I had become Shepard, I saw me in the game. In the second one I further saw the repercussions of my actions, the good and the bad. Though I noticed that a lot of the independence found in the first was gone and replaced with more linear missions, less exploration and open-world type missions. But we did gain impressive battles and a much stronger foe, and my squad mates depended on my choices. While I missed the old style, I readily embraced the new with its flaws. Then we get to the third, the ""ending we deserve"". From the get go, the bugs are obvious, the loading screen takes forever and the game freezes randomly during exploration sections. Conversations are painfully linear without much options for a more in depth dialogue, and the paragon renegade choices are quite obvious and don't really present much of a moral challenge anymore during basic game-play save for a few occasions. The Kinect option was over-hyped and not nearly as much fun as you would think. On a positive note the enemies are challenging, exciting, and be quite formidable lending this game some respect in that area, and the scenery is spectacular. Being able to see many of the home worlds was a great decision. But the story line becomes confusing at times, many characters show up without introduction which were never seen in the basic games, only in the dlc. Kai Leng being the most annoying of all of them. But even this was forgivable once I saw the fleet reach earth and full on assault the reapers. In my opinion it was the most awe inspiring battle I have ever seen in either movies or games. Seeing so much at stake, and understanding the emotion of the moment, how all three games had worked toward this. It was momentous. The assault on London furthered the fight, bringing my Shepard ever closer to the heart of the enemy. The increasing attacks, the stress, it was brilliant. Then the suicide charge to the beam. The brush of death, and then the crawl to the beam to fulfill your destiny. It was a story of a legend! It was genius! And then silence, you hobble up to the platform to meet TIM and Anderson. You defeat TIM and open the citadel arms and you sit back with Anderson, both of you barely alive but victorious...and then they decide to destroy everything you ever fought for in the next 15 minutes! The crucible was just a ploy! A scam! Up comes Mister AI/god/starchild/*sshole who decides to tell you the real story which can be boiled down to just plain racism and genocide. The smartest sentient life in the galaxy wasn't much for logic, no debate, no discussion, just pick a color and die. He gives you some bs story and expects you to eat it all up with no questions. Then no matter what decision you choose, the galaxy is destroyed, Shepard dies. Then to top it all off your crew leaves you for dead and act like they don't give a damn about what you just did. This was my ending? All my resources, choices, actions, and friendships boiled down to a color and galactic destruction in every option? How can I not be upset and feel scammed. Even at the end Shepard speaks of hope being the driving mechanism of life, which the catalyst shoots down as pathetic and useless. Why did Bioware do this? To teach me a life lesson that no matter what we all still fail? life is pointless?that I should never pre-order a game ever again? Seriously, nobody thought this was a bad idea?",Zsoldos5

212104,Halo 5: Guardians,XboxOne,5,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This is the worst halo game I have played including multiplayer and single player. I have played halo 1 through 4 and reach usually the day they were released. I had high hopes for 343 after reach and halo 4. You barely play as the master chief. Locke is the most uninteresting character in the halo universe. They seem to have made him black for the sake of diversity and decided thats enough we don't need to flesh this character out. I was waiting the whole game for the scene in the trailer where locke is broken down in front of the statue so I could put him down. Sergeant johnson was stereotypical but still a great character. It's like they didn't even try with locke. Anyone in his fire team would have been a better lead. The game play is repetitive. I found myself skipping entire sections of the game as Locke because I had no interest in what red team was doing. Almost none of what 343 led us to believe would be in the game from teaser trailers was in the game. Game was beaten on Heroic. I personally don't mind the absence of split screen but many fans wanted it so it should have been included. There is online co op but no matchmaking. I am likely forgetting more negatives anyway the campaign is a pile of garbage. I purchased an xbox one a week ago for this game and am already considering selling it. I read some of the books, the original spartans ans everyone on his team were given growth hormones as teens and were all typically a head taller than the average adult. In the games the spartans are bigger. Now locke and all the new spartans as I understand are just regular albeit very talented soldiers in spartan suits. Why are they the same size as the originals? The opening scene where lockes team slides down that hill is rediculous. In past games you have hunted down the leader of the heretics, even been in shootouts with him. They have locke or his team kill him off in a cutscene to simply further how badass we are supposed to think he is.The multiplayer is also a dissapointment. I don't play much warzone as I consistently find myself getting bored before the match is over. I also have 20+ hours into multiplayer am level 29 and I think I have 2 unique weapons unlocked. I don't have a problem with them charging for requisitions my issue is how long it takes to get them. I don't see the vast majority of players getting very far with this system. I primarily play team arena. Off the top of my head 3 maps are old maps and aside from that while the new maps are well designed they get repetitive very quickly. I don't understand how a series with such a vast majority of maps can fail to utilize them in this game. My biggest complaint however is the matchmaking. I have always been a 1 to 1.5 KD player, lets just say I am average. I got placed as platinum. I am constantly getting placed with opponents who are far better at this game than me. And when that isn't the case my teammate is in that position. I noticed people constantly quitting. 343 doesn't replace team mates who quit they claim so that no one will be put into a losing game and have their rank damaged. Heres an idea idiots replace missing players and just DONT adjust their rank for that game. I initially got frustrated by quitting teammates. I came to realize that matchmaking is broken. So now if my kd drops below .5 I quit. And i quit a lot. I will beat halo 6 someday, I want to see where this story goes. But I will either buy a copy used or play it at a friends.

I'm not a huge fan of city-builders (the only ones i've played are this, Tropico 4, and Sim City 2000) so I can't critique the game as much as others but I will try to offer some decent criticisms. The game seems to be lacking some road functionality, Traffic often takes the same lane on a 3 lane road and this ends up causing huge traffic jams. There's no way to connect a road to another and not have it create an intersection, this is especially annoying when using highway ramps or one way roads. There seems to be a lack of unique buildings. I found this glaring when trying to increase my tourism. Supposedly tourism is supposed to be a big way to get money but there's no real way to draw tourists other than making these big, unlockable, ""unique buildings"" which do nothing other than drawing tourists in very small numbers. There's also no way to terraform the environment. You can't make a hill or level a mountain. This becomes annoying when trying to place a large building because you have to find a place that is totally flat. Airports are my biggest grief with this. Due to the generally bland nature of the maps (almost completely flat with some trees and rivers here or there) all your cities end up looking similar. Citizens seem to die quickly and in waves. No matter how much you're growing you will come across ""death waves"" where hundreds, if not thousands, of your citizens will die within a few days. This is annoying and makes it hard to judge what your true growth is or if you've come across a serious problem.   I'm sure there are more issues I came across but I can't think of them now. Overall the game is enjoyable and I intend on going back to it. The devs seem intent of fixing at least some of these issues and supposedly on releasing a ton of DLC. In the mean time, the game has great mod support which can fix some of these issues and make the game much more enjoyable.",JimCorbett

156336,Batman: Arkham Knight,PlayStation4,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        The game is pretty solid with brilliant gameplay and fantastic game design. The city itself looks very detailed and the new batsuit looks quite fantastic as well. The combat is every bit as fun with new combos and new variations in thugs. The story is good enough, not as good as City. The villains seemed very dull with limited apperances. The reveal of the Arkham Knight was pretty obvious and the character itself is quite weak. The lack of boss fights is a negetive as all the confrontation between batman and the villains were demostrated through cutscenes. Another problem is the overuse of the Batmobile. Granted the batmobile is quite fun to do combat with when you are taking out enemy drones but the racing sequences do get a bit annoying at times. The side missions are fun but can feel repetitve at times. Also you cannot see the full ending unless you have completed all side missions.To sum up the game does a good job of ending the franchise on a high and truly there weren't that many negetives aside from the ones I mentioned which are very subjective and can also be taken positively by some people.",Shak7738

I found the career mode really dull. There are no rewards or unlocks and the races are really easy, unless you manually adjust the AI to make it more difficult to win. A strange choice. Much as the vaunted ""Freedom"" may have sounded good, it provides no incentive to progress, and allows rookies to jump straight into the most difficult multiplayer and wreck others races.It's multiplayer where the game both shines and provides the greatest let down. If you manage to find a ""clean"" race with a sensible qualification period and lap count, the game is an absolute blast. Unfortunately you'll mostly be playing public games which are like the wild west and filled with trolls. While this is no fault of Slightly Mad Studios, they have provided no features in Multiplayer to punish bad players. When you're punted off the track or rear ended by a troll, it's most often you that will be punished for corner cutting. The lack of penalties for trolls can be rage inducing.Add to this the lack of cars (almost no Japanese cars is very disappointing), slow menu loading (with no egg timer to show that anything is happening)  MP joining bugs and crashes (5 or so in a week) a potentially awesome game ends as just ok.

In conclusion I can say that this is the best 3DS game to date the graphics are really good and the 3d effect is pretty cool, the game is worth buying especially for RE fans that wanted another horror game in the series but with some fillers and action based missions I give it a 9/10.",X-fushion

The PvE is very different to any other MMORPG I've played. Each instance has a limit of 5 players which I found slightly disappointing yet they are very challenging and requires a lot more cooperation than any other multi player PvE experience, like World Of Warcraft for instance. What I found very interesting is the fact ArenaNet based the game on giving the player a choice of how to level. For example, one could level to 80 with just World PvP (A new feature which involves a server VS server VS server system. Which takes place in a huge battleground). Or Structured PvP (A smaller PVP environment). Or even just questing. The game hasn't got a compelling storyline but this can easily be avoided.The game play varies greatly from profession to profession, depending on what type of profession you're playing. The thief and most melee classes consist of more button mashing then skillful play with ranged classes mostly bound to a powerful rotation.Personally I recommend picking this up even if you don't plan on playing for a considerable amount of time.

It is almost a perfect simulator if you want to get as close to the real thing as possible. But one thing that disappoints me (and, I'm sure others) is how the 800 of those 1,000 cars are standard cars (standard cars do not have interiors that can be viewed while driving, and the attention to detail isn't entirely there). It also bothers me how some of today's cars (the Bugatti Veyron, shockingly) are the standard cars. Also, most of those 800 cars were ripped straight out of GT4. Very lazy, and downright disappointing for five years in the works. The AI is also quite laughable. If you are all racing a Ferrari F10, it's not a challenge at all.

Don't got much more to say than that.You need to watch Kingsglaive and Brotherhood if you want to have a full understanding of the preplot to the game or just go look up what happens. One or the other. The story telling isn't bad at all. Its intense at times as it should be. I love Noctis because he reminds me alot of myself. I won't reveal many spoilers but I think its a good story.The open world is good but it doesn't go to its full potential. However, for the westernized JRPG that keeps with its old roots, I think it was done very well. It doesnt compare to some of the triple A titles who have been working on Westernized Open World RPG's for years like Bethesda and others have.However, this should be obvious since they are trying to blend the two together. We have to remember that this is 2016 for the old FF folk that are annoyed. This is a generation of open world and very sandboxy games. I didn't mind the fetch quests. I've played Maple Story for almost 11 years and I'm used to it. If you are annoyed by fetch quests you'll be annoyed! I personally do not like the ""stumble upon secondary quests"" attitude. I can deal with it if it was the prominent use of secondary quests in this game. Yes there is alot of time spent in the car, that's what you have fast travel for. Be thankful, they could've made you walk the entire game.Finally, do not go into this game expecting a savior. Final Fantasy 15 is not a savior. It is the foundation of something they really can build off of. We all know the JRPG's are struggling and the reality is they need to blend JRPG's and Westernized stuff together or they will continue to struggle. Some people may think this is an insane comment. I do not believe it is. I believe that if they polish up alot of the stuff in this game they truly could revive the series. Likewise, do not come in overhyping it or you will be disappointed. I was skeptical of the game when I first played it but once I settled in I personally enjoyed it. So go into the game and enjoy the game. Do not nit pick at everything you see because you'll find yourself rating it a 5 and say you wasted your money and whine like a baby. Its definitely a 7-8 game but because I love the series and am hopeful that this is the beginning of something good I gave it a higher rating.

Fallout 4 has its ups and downs like any other game, improving upon certain mechanics, while also leaving out other mechanics that are pivotal to the Fallout universe.

The graphics are a bit watered down in certain areas, and the wasteland as a whole all looks the same from the exterior side of things, but all in all the game does look gorgeous. The weapon and armor system do allow for upgrades which increases the amount of options players have when approaching certain situations, but the lack of base weapons in general is noticeable when compared to the amount of weapon selection that Fallout New Vegas had. Quests are a bit linear, simply sending the player to pick up this  at this , or to kill a person to save this person from death, but that is concerning mostly the side quests, not the main quest line which is diverse and fun to traverse at least the first time around. The Pipboy side of things has pretty much remained the same as past Fallout games as well, allowing the player to manage their inventory, do their quests, tune in to radio stations across the wasteland, among various other things. When it comes down to it, if the player wants a huge world to explore, a bunch of quests to do, quite a bit of weapon customization, and plenty of people/creatures to interact with, then Fallout 4 is the game for them, even with its certain flaws.",MatthewWulfe1

No doubt Ubisoft seems to have done a very good job in fulfilling customer's request for features in game that was first unveiled in AC3 but was not polished well which was naval warfare. Honestly, when AC3 came out, the naval warfare was one key feature that really attracts me the most but I was a bit disappointed because it only appears as side missions and players don't have much choice to sail to other places and uses it as a mean of transports for exploring. However, AC4 really revamped that whole concept and brought my wish to real. For me, the open sea free-for-exploration with a ship is the best selling point for AC4. Never in my entire life have I seen a game that managed to handle naval warfare very well. It is too awesome. The ability to sail across the sea, stop by islands and explore them seamlessly without any boundaries, engage in epic naval battle and board the ships are the best key features for me. Playing the game somehow kind of reminds me a bit of Pirates of the Caribbean especially during the naval battle. Plus the new engine in the game which allows for spontaneous storms and huge waves to occur really added to the realism and epicness of the game. Seriously I wouldn't mind if the next AC5 continues on the sea exploration concept. In fact, I really hope they would retain naval exploration in the next installment. For anyone that has not played any Assassin's Creed series before, I think this installment is the best way to start with. It's like GTA but in a pirate settings in the caribbeans.",asy8492

It's not the quality I expected from Valve Software.It seems TF2 is now Valve's money making machine. People buy the items that the folks at Valve haven't even made themselves (they just ask the community to make them) and add them without even giving them proper animations, stats what so ever. Seems like Valve spent the majority of their time on giving the menu class images hats.As for the graphics you can already see that the game is out there for a long time.

This game/Visual Novel is the sequel/mid-quel of the 1st one, and is practically the explanation and process of how the D-mail Okabe received after falling to rescue Kurisu the 1st time.Compare to the original one, this game is amazingly well-made, following suite with the emotion of the MC, full of regret and sadness. The game introduce a new aspect beside time travel: a program which stores and develops the owner's memories on its own, like a true human put inside a monitor. And surprisingly the concept merges so well with the time travelling, giving a fresh air for the series. And thus, it's the main root of many problem, despairs, and the dark side of the game.The jokes, happy events and heart-warming moment are still there, but they won't last long, and the reality after that will hit you hard... So just, brace yourself in advance when it happens.The game length, in my opinion, is fairly shorter than the previous, but it's more painful, heart-broken, and frustrated, since the MC had already given up on Kurisu after all. Also, in order to reach the true end, you have to play the game once, then start again/ reload the crucial moment. The fact that there are less options to guide the story, or interact with other characters will probably annoy some players, but I think it is a good thing, since you can focus more on the story, without sidetracking to other diversions.Overall, there are lots of shortcoming from this game, and the true end leaves much to be desired (since you already know what will happen after it in the original one). However, I love it. Manly tears have been shred, and I enjoy the journey far more than I expected. If you have already experienced Steins;Gate, then I'd 100% recommend you to play this.

You also lose everything after every chapter, and it's a confusing strategy; it makes grinding and exploring sort of unrewarding. But other than that the combat outside of building is a bonus, it breaks the monotony of doing nothing but farming and building. The core gameplay of building a town from scratch is addictive and fun, the storylines/quests is another added bonus that also aids in breaking up the monotomy of farming for resources.

Its only DLC, the Missing Link, should have been free to download as a expansion patch.",jwt7000

What scares me the most about this game is all these 10 out of 10s, the lack of honesty and sheer blind fan boy attitudes will keep this game series from developing in a positive direction and that scares and saddens me.

What scares me the most about this game is all these 10 out of 10s, the lack of honesty and sheer blind fan boy attitudes will keep this game series from developing in a positive direction and that scares and saddens me. Anyway my review:I love this game because: The artistic style, the aiming controls (for slingshot etc), the story line is very strong, the Japanese style voice acting, the setting of the game, the bug hunting, the new tools/equipment.I hate this game because: The sword motion controls suck, and hinder my enjoyment. The support character Fi is annoying, she's more annoying than Navi. The game holds your hand constantly, repeating instructions way too many times. The game tells you constantly about the items you're picking up if you've loaded a save (for example, I have 39 sacred bugs, I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE) and you can't skip or speed up these explanations. The constant dungeon feel, linearity and lack of exploration (and lack of exploration reward). Finally the music is terrible with only Skyloft and Ballad of the Goddess being remotely catchy. The harp stuff is awful too.Overall I don't hate this game but I'm getting bored 25 hours in, I just want to finish it now and find out what happens. I'm expecting many people to disagree with my review but I certainly hope Nintendo pay attention to more level headed reviews like mine.",Victory
184728,Sonic Mania,Switch,10,"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the best Sonic game ever made.  It's about 20 years late, but we finally have a worthwhile sequel to Sonic 3 and Knuckles.  This is exactly what Sonic the Hedgehog 4 should have been.This wasn't made by Sonic Team, instead it was made by fans who were hired by Sega.  The love the team has for the originals is everywhere in the game.  The gameLadies and gentlemen, I present to you the best Sonic game ever made.  It's about 20 years late, but we finally have a worthwhile sequel to Sonic 3 and Knuckles.  This is exactly what Sonic the Hedgehog 4 should have been.This wasn't made by Sonic Team, instead it was made by fans who were hired by Sega.  The love the team has for the originals is everywhere in the game.  The game plays very similarly to Sonic 3 and Knuckles. Playing this game you can see just how timeless the original formula was.  People seem to forget after one bad 3D Sonic after another(although I was a pretty big fan of Colors and Generations) that this was once a brilliant series.  Some people have fooled themselves into thinking Sonic was never good.  This is complete crap, and this game proves the original formula holds up today.The graphics are bit more advanced than the Genesis version, it's more on par with with the 32x.  Everything looks great, it's full of color and personality.  We get three heavily remixed versions of Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone, and Oil Rig zone with plenty of new features.  The rest of the levels are pretty much original, though some of them share similarities to classic Sonic levels.  There are 12 stages in total, which is one less than Sonic 3 and Knuckles.  There are two Acts per stage and a secret Final Boss.  You'll get a few very familiar bosses, although they've been significantly changed.  We even get a couple bosses from the Game Gear games.  Fortunately the Sonic 2 Game Gear boss is not one of the Dark Souls DLC-tier difficult ones. The boss design is better than all of the Genesis Sonics, and every single act has a boss fight.  Many of the bosses have more than one stage, making things very interesting.  The bosses aren't just the only thing that has been improved.  The levels are now even more creative than the ones in the originals.  Sonic Mania is just an improvement of the Sonic 3 and Knuckles formula, which in and of itself is one the top 100 games of all time in my opinion.  It feels like a natural evolution of the series.  This should have been Sonic the Hedgehog 4.The difficulty is just right.  It's starts off pretty easy, but gets harder halfway through the game.  Tales is the easiest character to play since he can just fly over obstacles, and you may want to pick him first unless you want more of challenge.  Knuckles can glide and climb.  Sonic can use the special abilities of shields.  You can also play Sonic and Tails.  It may not be obvious at first, but you can actually control Tales a bit and allow him to lift Sonic to otherwise unreachable places.  Sonic and Tails have the same levels.  However, I've only played the first two levels for Knuckles, but the Green Hill Zone is different for him and designed around his climbing ability.  I think overall there will be some differences in the levels for Knuckles, much like in Sonic 3.If you run out of lives in this game you go back to Act 1 of that stage.  This is a fairly big death penalty, though not nearly as bad as Sonic 2 where the final boss was absurdly difficult and if you died you went back to the beginning of the game.  You'll be trying as hard as you can to get 100 rings for an extra life to use against the fairly difficult bosses.  Prepare to get 90-99 rings and then lose all of them.  There are also hidden lives in the levels.  All of this encourages you to be careful and also explore the levels.  If you explore you'll also find the special stages which are similar to the ones in Sonic CD.  Also, the globe special stages from Sonic 3 make a return.The levels are huge and multi-layered so when you play them again you can take a completely different path.  This adds replay value, which is good because the game is on the short side.  You're probably looking at about 5-6 hours to beat it the first time.  This a game though that you'll want to play again immediately after beating it, with another character.The game is only $20, and frankly I can't think of a better way to spend $20 right now.  Sonic 3 and Knuckles required you to buy 2 $50 games and hook them together, so adjusted for inflation Sonic 3 and Knuckles was $161 dollars.  Now you know why kids in the 90s didn't own an extensive library of video games.  Renting them over a weekend for a couple dollars was a lot more common.In conclusion, Sonic Mania is practically flawless.  I can't think of anything bad to say about this game.  It's one of the best side-scrollers ever made.  It's even better than any of the recent side-scrolling Nintendo games like Donkey Kong or New Super Mario Bros.  It makes up for the short length with huge amounts of replay value.  It deserves a perfect 10 out 10.",LiTeRaLyShAkInG

From levels 1-12 that took around 8 hours to gain. After that you are off to the dunes (that is if you could safely make it there. No you can not ride a Chocobo there; because the license to ride one is level 20). Once there, depending on server you might have a long wait for a party. Back then if you happened to be half way to the next level while other party members were only at 10,100 or even 300 into a level you would not be considered into a party. Why? Because after you have leveled your newly gained leveled just half others exp while you wanted to gain an exp buffer. If the people allowed you to stay and dwarf their exp you would be considered lucky. It would be rather hard to find another party with in your level and exp range. Thus started the waiting game. To which people decided to quit, tried to solo on their own or simply play Beastmaster. Adding insult to injury Chains of Promathia also frustrated people. It was hard to find people; let alone wanting to be picky about what kind of people you wanted helping you do missions for that expansion pack. People weren't willing to help out with missions if you weren't popular in one level another. During my 1 year and 11 months absents the game introduced Fields of Valor which introduced training Regime. Which is very nice when one can not find a party or they do not have time to stand around to wait for an invite. With players running around occupying areas leveling their adventuring fellow and low spawn rates it makes it rather hard to enjoy using the field manual pages to gain exp better. Can't really complain, but better spawn rate could fix that issue. If field manual isn't one's cup of tea then level sync can help with find a party; without worry about dwarfing the rest of the party's exp.

Even if you can beat it, don't.The game is full of random 1-shots, deaths to things you've already dodged, erratic behaviour where enemies float around the battlefield for no apparent reason, walls that don't work, and the camera ""assist"" loves to make it completely impossible to pull off a lot of trick shots that would make the game more playable.Boss encounters typically have 3 moves in their moveset, and that moveset subtly evolves over the course of the bossfight in distinct phases. The checkpoint system is very liberally used, and the gameplay is hilariously punishing, and the result is that bossfights basically boil down to attempting the same 20% of a boss 50+ times until the boss randomly doesn't do ""the thing"", and then you win.It is very, very obvious that the combat designers have absolutely no clue what they're doing at all, and this mars what should have been an otherwise great game.However, the game is still pretty and the combat still looks good, so I'll give it a 6. If you play to play it on a lower difficulty setting, the 9 and 10's that have been rightfully given are more appropriate.",Ishayu

244494,SUPERHOT,PC,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        [Brief Synopsis of Full Review]Whereas many strategy or puzzle games last much longer than they should or wrap up much sooner than anticipated, I think Superhot nails just about the right amount of time to place an emphasis on standard gameplay. Before things can get too overused or stale the main content is over and it's onto the seemingly neverending variations of levels available to test yourself with. To add to replay value there are also differing ""modes"" that prevent the use of certain items or make the main objective be that you complete the level in a specific fashion, furthering adding elements of strategy and puzzle to the gameplay. Simple in concept and only relatively more complicated in execution, Superhot is super and it is hot.Concept: Take the core of gameplay from any shooter and that gameplay will revolve around shooting, plain and simple. It's in the title just like it's in gaming DNA. Now add a twist where the entire thing moves in slow motion and you're prone to insta-kill enemies just as they can do so to you. Messes with your mind a little bit at first doesn't it?Graphics: I personally loved the art style that permeates this world. Your enemies are brightly colored but not so detailed as to be fleshed out beyond mere polygonal shapes. The same can be said for the surrounding world, which lacks color but remains sharp and clear in its definite shapes and settings.Sound: The sound work is nothing special or remotely spectacular but what it does is excellent pace the game along so that you never feel like you're chugging along slowly, rather playing through in a blur of speed alongside the constantly crescendoing and galloping soundtrack.Playability: There should be no confusion here once the controls have been established, as your one and only goal is to move forward at all costs, eliminating those who dare to stand in your way and doing your best to survive their counterattacks.Entertainment: For a title that revolves around slowing combat down, I never once felt bored or tired of the matters at hand and instead felt that much more tense and anxious as I made my way slowly but surely through the levels and the world.Replay Value: Moderately High.Overall Score: 8.0",JohnWitten

The first few nights are spent desperately scavenging materials for tools with which to build, hunt, and defend yourself; construction (or discovery) of emergency shelters is required to be able to sleep or save the game, and doing all this while trying to stay out of sight of the roving cannibals is a wonderfully tense and even strategic experience.After about a week on the island, you should be well enough equipped to actually take on two or three cannibals in a fight if need be, and begin descending into the island's many cave systems which are dense with more powerful mobs but also peppered with more powerful tools. You start feeling capable of tackling the challenges both above and underground.After two weeks on the island, the surface will have gradually become populated exclusively by 12-foot mutants and Dr. Manhattan clones, who can all outrun you like you were standing still and two-shot you once they catch up. Attempting combat is complete suicide, and most of the weaponry you've spent your time building up is now effectively worthless, save your precious limited supply of explosives. Any base you may have built on the surface won't be worth attempting to return to as you are forced underground into a winding array of tunnel mazes, fumbling around in constant near-zero-light conditions as your sole feasible means of egress. God help you if you haven't yet found all the most important equipment by this point.It's also still fairly buggy.In short it has a strong start, but a lategame that I could only recommend to a C.H.U.D.",Techbane

120308,Dark Souls,PlayStation3,10,"Back in 2009, I spent 120+ hours of my life on Demon's Souls, and since then, I have not found its equal.  As dark, challenging, and repressive as the game was, Demon's Souls still managed to feel like a breath of fresh air in the staling game market, throwing back to classic mechanics that were left in the 80s and early 90s with 8-bit, 16-bit, and arcade games.  I find it interesting thatBack in 2009, I spent 120+ hours of my life on Demon's Souls, and since then, I have not found its equal.  As dark, challenging, and repressive as the game was, Demon's Souls still managed to feel like a breath of fresh air in the staling game market, throwing back to classic mechanics that were left in the 80s and early 90s with 8-bit, 16-bit, and arcade games.  I find it interesting that Demon's Souls was far better received in North America than in its native Japan (790,000 copies in NA to Japan's 300,000, many of which were sold after the game's subsequest success overseas), as the game reflects more western RPG conventions and D&D-esque styling than the increasingly common anime-styled games that get labeled as ""JRPGs.""  Dark Souls is a spiritual successor in the purest sense of the over-used phrase.  Its controls are identical to Demon's Souls, yet they are even more precise than before.  The artistic style, starting classes, soundtrack, and multiplayer options are all quite similar as well, but again, they have been tweaked to be a bit superior to that of Demon's Souls.  The graphics are more detailed and crisp than ever, running in 720p or 1080i on PS3, making it one of a small handful of PS3 games that can display in 1920x1080.  But the biggest change here is the open-world structure.  Unlike Demon's Souls, which had the Nexus serve as a hub between several more fragmented worlds, Dark Souls has interconnected areas that form one gigantic, seemless world.  It's also at least three times the size of all of Demon's Souls' areas combined, and the zones are still diverse and well-conceived.  The linking of various zones works kind of like classic Metroid or Castlevania maps, where shortcuts to previous areas can be unlocked, making exploration valuable and rewarding to the overall mission.  Instead of the Nexus hub zone, players can rest at bonfires, where they can also upgrade weapons and armor, among other things.  Combat is also enjoyable and very deep, and enemy mobs are more varied than in Demon's Souls.  In short, Dark Souls improves on every aspect of its predecessor, and with the new open-world structure, Dark Souls can easily stand up to the industry's western-developed heavy hitters (like Dragon Age and Elder Scrolls).  In fact, I can honestly say that Dark Souls could steal some serious thunder from Skyrim by offering a more fresh yet hardcore approach to the genre.  I also think that it's astounding that developer From Software could make lightning strike twice - it would have been far too easy for some developers to misinterpret Demon's Souls overwhelming success in North America and try too hard to tweak the subsequent formula to cater to American tastes.  Instead, From Software stayed true to its original form, even deciding to increase the challenge for Dark Souls.  And as one final point, let me also say this:  Anyone who has not tried Demon's Souls or Dark Souls should not let the now-legendary difficulty of the series discourage them.  The challenge that these games offers is not the same kind of hard-for-the-sake-of-hard frustration that some games fall victim to.  Even if you are normally frustrated by difficult games, it's usually because of cheap mechanics and the feeling of having to fight the controls or poor design, and none of that is an issue with the Souls games.  They just demand a little more observation, a bit of strategy and thought.  From Software trusts that its gamers are intelligent, diligent, and skilled enough to handle that challenge, and that's what makes every victory in Dark Souls feel like a real achievement.  The game may not be for everyone, but I would at least encourage every PS3 or XBox360 owner to try it.",JPoppaWUSC

I have the first edition PS Vita.Keeping In Mind:-Ported from a console release.-Few years old at this point.-Turn based strategy is not for everyone.The BAD:-It's a port. This game isn't optimized for PS Vita. If it was, I think there would be a lot more touch input or some integration of the camera or microphone and that would have made it a little more interesting for newcomers to the series like myself.-In the same breadth of the point above, input can be a little tedious at times due to the fact that the game is older than most Vita titles. You may find yourself scrolling to an option in the middle of combat where you might instinctively try to touch the screen and it can hinder the momentum of the game.-A healthy dose of glitches. The few glitches I've encountered are not game breaking but can be super inconvenient. On occasion, the movement area highlights may disappear but the cursor continues to be labeled when your character is ""Dashing"" so minor visual issue there. Rarely, your grappling hook might not take you to where you pointed. Lastly, if you use the suspend game feature frequently, it may freeze your game (usually during a loading screen). All of these have easy fixes or don't pose a true issue.The GOOD:-Excellent sound design. Everything from switching weapons to the voice acting is top notch here. Sound is usually an area where mobile gaming tends to ""trim some fat"" and that isn't present here. This could be looked at as a good point to porting?-Deep resource, item and staff management system. There's a lot of systems to sink your teeth into here and it makes you feel like your decisions have an important impact in the game world you're trying to save. The management aspect of this game is what keeps you coming back. The progression in relation to how you manage your time and resources feels rewarding and definitely makes combat more fun.-Spending the time required managing people has you growing emotional ties...to fictional characters that are procedurally generated...yes, it's a little weird but it speaks to how much this game can immerse you despite the fact its a Vita title.-Console-Quality gameplay. Because it's a port, the core gameplay you expect from a PS3, or even PS4 title, remains completely intact albeit with some visual downgrades.-Control over the game. The game offers different ways to switch it up as you see fit. For instance, in the menu, you can change it so if you re-attempt a mission the randomly generated map also changes. No two missions will be the same, No two playthroughs will be the same, Hell your friend's game may be vastly different than your game just based on the options you've changed cementing this as a game you won't delete from your Vita's overpriced memory card ever.TL;DR: You come for the turn-based combat against aliens but you stay for the resource management and progression.",ReaperWolf91

It is very reminiscent of the Devil May Cry series, but has more visual flair when it comes to weapons and combos. There are a few similarities to other games in the genre, such as roaming around to search for items, collecting treasure, using finishing executions, etc. However, the ""Witch Time"" gameplay mechanic is what truly makes this game standout from most titles. It is performed by dodging enemy attacks right before they connect. While in ""Witch Time,"" time slows down and you are able to inflict more damage than usual. It adds some complexity to the gameplay, while implementing a fresh mechanic to the hack and slash genre.Story:In Bayonetta, you play as the title character, who is an Umbran Witch. She has been awake for 20 years, but is unable to remember her past after a 500-year slumber. She has ""one half of the eye"" in her possession, a pendant that is vital to witches. Her informant, Enzo, learns that the other ""half"" is located somewhere in Europe. She arrives in the fictional city of Vigrid, where she fights many enemies, including the Cardinal Virtues. Bayonetta's story is decent, however, the presentation is horrendous. Every character, other than Bayonetta, has little to no character development. The cutscenes do not add to the game, but merely serve as a way to confuse the player even more. By the end of the game, you will probably be asking more questions, rather than know all of the answers.Graphics/AppearanceGraphically, Bayonetta is an average game. The game runs poorly on the PS3, with constant frame rate drops, screen tearing, and excessive loading screens. However, the developer offered a solution post-release. At the the menu screen, there is an ""install"" option, which will install the game onto your hard drive. Unfortunately, the install is 4GB in size. If you don't have enough memory, you will be stuck playing a terrible port. It is Absolutely Unacceptable to release a game in this kind of condition! The game is not unplayable, but the issues WILL be noticed. I know I've been harsh thus far; but I would be lying if I said the game didn't have amazing art direction. Bayonetta's style is impeccable! From Bayonetta's combo animations to extravagant boss designs, creativity was not spared throughout the development process! Bayonetta is very unique in comparison to most video games.Pros:-Challenging Game-Fluid Gameplay-Unique Art Direction-Creative Special ExecutionsCons:-4GB Install. If you don't have enough memory, you will be playing a game filled with constant screen tearing, frame rate drops, and loading screens-Horrendous Storytelling. Little to no character development, bad cutscenes, and confusing storylineVerdict:Bayonetta is a good game, unfortunately, it has many glaring issues on the PS3. Buy the 360 version if possible.

All the game has done is gone from painfully slow to this: *blinks* ""Huh? Did I just hit 60? Where did all the zones go?""I could understand the reduction in mount prices(having spent the fortune and time it was for the Paladin charger.) That brings me to another big point. Paladins got no choice. My first toon was a hunter, but in BC I made a Dranei Paladin. At some point the devs made a switch, and all Dranei got an Elekk Paladin mount. I liked my charger, had the feat of strength for earning it the old fashioned way, and was told I couldn't use it without paying for a race change to Human.So we get the crux of the situation, and that's money. It's all Blizzard cares about. At this point they should stop selling Vanilla, and make Cata the base: with Wrath and BC $10 expansions. No, they want the money. So that means it currently costs: $40 for the Battle-chest, $40 for Wrath, and $40 for Cata.This shows with most of the content. It has gone from spending time to find neat things to a grind for everything. Each expansion they make it longer to reach fishing cap(even with dailies it's painful.) They SHOULD have left the number of catches required to skill the same as they were at the highest in vanilla. So even if leveling is now super fast, it takes a solid month of grinding to do anything remotely useful dungeon or raid wise. Especially without guild support.Professions are worse. Fast to level? Only herbalism, mining, and skinning. The amount of mats for tailoring is insane, and the same for enchanting. Want the good recipes? NOPE! Not only are the high end one PVP, but they cost bolts of cloth to get.So instead of having an ok profession experience with useful gear, it's a painfully slow one, with a leveling grind that's so fast you don't get to enjoy the zones. I used to know all the zones by heart, just from leveling that first single toon.Stay away from this generic MMO.

Taking the only good part of Guitar Hero (the drop in/drop out) and improving it, then adding keyboards, harnony vocals from The Beatles Rock Band and getting rid of that repetitive World Tour Mode you have the apex of rhythm gaming. I'm not going to mention Pro-Guitar although it's a very interesting idea because I have not played it myself. But even without it this game is a must have if you have any interest in this genre. I will say that Pro Keyboards while supremely difficult are quite well done and fun. This will be a stand out instrument once more DLC featuring this instrument is made available (such as the upcoming Billy Joel stuff).They have taken the challenges of Rock Band 2 and worked them into a very endearing set of challenges to make up a tour that should take you about a week. This mode is complete with videos that for the first time feel like they give your band members a personality. These are hysterical the first time you see them and you really start thinking of your characters as a real band. Not only that but everything you do even when you just mess around playing songs in the quickplay mode it counts towards your band progress and unlockable clothing. There were a lot of complaints about the setlist early on mostly because the bands for the 2000's were not really well known, but most of those songs grow on you if you give them a chance. That is the beauty of Harmonix games, they can turn you into fans of new bands and show you that there is more to music than your own jaded point of view. For example you do discover that Amy Winehouse despite her personal problems is talented at what she does or that Metric have a really great sound. I think that all the positive reviews from critics and players alike is proof that this is a great game. I know the genre has suffered from over exposure and the fact that in general a rhythm game is just trying to hit the right buttons to play the song the best you can. However, Harmonix have taken that as far as they could with this edition. There are a few things that could've been better, but they are minor and do not affect the fun such as when you have more than 5 or more players you still only see 4 on the screen or that in all instrument mode which is the mode that is required to have bass, guitar and keyboards on a song the vocals are not scored. But this game is about the fun and easy to use interface. If you have an open mind this game will make you happy.",Nathanielx

You get to observe how Carl is used by the corrupted police officers, the irony in that situation, process in which Johnson family breaks apart sweetened with occasional humor in events such as Jeffrey and Freddy's dialogue (dropping the soap).

I have preordered every halo game since halo 3 including this one. I am about as big as a Halo fan as one can get. Now let me review this game the way it should have been reviewed.The story is weak. I think 343 went the wrong direction by making the forerunners the main threat in the Halo series now.  To me even in Halo 4, which I enjoyed until the end when you didn't get to fight the boss; don't get me started on that, the forerunner AI knights and whatnot just get boring to kill and the later missions are basically just wave after wave of the exact same enemies. Let's put aside the story. Let's look at the actual gameplay and level design of the story missions. This campaign doesn't play like any other halo, and I mean that in a not so good way. There are missions with vehicles yes, but, 343 is pretty much try to show off their new addition of wall smashing that gives you the advantage of flanking enemies. It's a nice new feature, but not at the expense of not being able to drive around like a maniac in a warthog. There is basically no time at any point in the game you can use your Spartan abilities to commandeer enemy vehicles. If I hadn't played previous Halo’s I would have no idea that you can jump on enemy vehicles and smash them, blow them up, steal them, etc. There just isn't enough vehicles for that to even happen.I was expecting this game to be like Halo Reach; I thought Halo Reach campaign was one of it not the best in the series. I wasn't even expecting Master Chief. I had initially thought that 343 would go the route of every other year would be Master Chief. That didn't happen and it hurt the game. Master Chief is seen as a lone wolf throughout the entire series. He works with some people on and off, but, basically they are all fodder and he does everything alone. He is seen as someone quiet and mysterious and suits his character. In this game he is commanding fellow Spartans and constantly talking. He gets downed and he’s like help me up and then he’s like I’m up. His entire unit takes off their helmet and is talking and he just sits there like an idiot with his on. It works when you are lone wolf it doesn’t work when you’re with your peers or as they say in the game “Chiefs family”.This game unlike any of the Halo games is designed purely for co-op. Playing this game alone on legendary is extremely difficult. Not because the game is so much harder than other series but because you have to get behind a lot of mobs and flank them which is extremely hard to do when the AI dies nonstop, and if you get downed they all rush to revive you which usually ends with them all dead or them all dragging the mobs onto you. The AI is glitchy. I get that there is a lot for this AI to do. They need to fly, they need to jump, they need to climb etc. but if you’re going to make a game that is so dependent on the AI you better make the AI much stronger and smarter. They are basically the same as you they get hit a few times and they drop like flies. There are bosses called wardens that you need to shoot in the back and as the game progresses you need to fight the same guy over and over with more and more of him at once. You can’t get behind him if the AI is dead; they die with one hit of his sword and they don’t dodge so if you go down they run, at least try to, through him and end up getting downed and you wipe. One great example of the AI being totally idiotic is near the beginning of the game there is a part of the game you need to fly around in banshees and blow up cooling rods and I get hit bad in my banshee so I bail and get downed on a top of a platform. I call for help knowing that I will likely die but it was worth a shot.  There is an AI flying around in a banshee and when I call for help she’s like I’m coming Chief and just bails out of her banshee and I watch her fall to her death. Although this is hilarious these types of things happen way too often to find funny as the game progresses.The game is glitchy. I encountered many glitches throughout the game. The most I have ever seen in any Halo. One really annoying glitch was near the end one of the missions the screen would go almost all black in the middle of a fight and I would have to push the Xbox button bring up the menu and open Halo in order to fix it, which would result in my dying most times.The multiplayer is just as bad as the story. I liked the direction Halo 4 went. They were going more towards a COD style, and I think that's exactly what Halo needed in order to survive. They just needed to take another step towards that in this game but instead they stepped back. They listened to what a small minority, that will never allow this game to be great, and reverted back to a Halo 3 style of MP. Bungie did one thing right and made their ""halo"" Destiny much more like COD and look how successful that has been, even after **** over their players.Out of characters, game =average",liquidy

This method is actually one of the most detailed parts of the game, as each design matters depending on the course, as certain major gimmicks appear through some games, and others don't. Super Mario Maker keeps each game true to its original and that is what I found the most impressing.The tutorial is pretty good for new Mario players ( although boring and it could've been better).Another thing that I would like to point out that is so great in the game is the use of different, more complex items as unlockables. I find this to be very essential so the game isn't a freebie with everything when you start the game so you have little to no experience becoming a level designer. Once you have more experience with the basic items, how the unlockables correlate are very well done so the game isn't so confusing.The online mode is amazing, other than some minor missteps. The completion system is perfect, the sections you want to play are easy to reach, and the difficulty setting, especially with the 100-Mario challenge, are mostly well done (despite some issues). The comment section is good, but flawed, as the game takes a ""Minecraft"" approach to online play and no censorship is done for younger players. Nintendo needs to be careful of this. Invisible blocks are a broken way of posting difficult online courses. Personally, I think Nintendo needs a way to stop that.One minor ( but biggest) problem with the game is the lack of some really cool additives that should've been used in the game, mainly the checkpoints.Even though it sounds like I would give this a 7/10, the game is nostalgia-bringer for the older adults/teens and a great start for younger children. Fun for all ages and can bring a challenge, anything you wanted in a Mario world is not limited to many fun features and gameplay that this game brings.

So many that sometimes using them is a little awkward, as you have to press two buttons at once or something. No big deal though. That's the price of having a lot of abilities. Stealth mechanics are pretty good and, indeed, quite Assassin's Creed like. If you've played that series you'll be right at home. Enemies can be ridiculously oblivious to you running around and killing their buddies, so it ain't no Splinter Cell, but that's probably for the best.As far as being open-world, yes you can go anywhere and there's a lot of stuff to do, but don't expect the scale of, for example, an Elder Scrolls game. There aren't skills, there aren't cities, shops, no people you can really talk to, just some people in cutscenes and slaves that say a few words of thanks when you free them. The world is also pretty small, I was disappointed by how small it is. They pack a lot of stuff in, but you will see it all pretty quickly. By the ten hour mark I had unlocked all dozen-ish of the forge towers in the game (pretty much exactly the same thing as viewpoints in Assassin's Creed) and forged the legendary bow by finishing all the bow missions (ten, they take like two minutes each).Nemesis system: a lot of people are talking this up, and rightfully so. This is the first current-gen game (I refuse to call PS4 and Xbone next gen anymore) I've played that does something that last gen couldn't. In a nutshell, orcs are also playing the game, trying to kill their enemies (including you) and get promoted to war chief while you play the game. Sometimes some orc you fought a while ago will show up and try to kill you at a really inconvenient time. But that's just payback for when you tried to kill him at a really inconvenient time. You can also take control of orcs by defeating them and order them to kill other orcs you don't like. And you can help them level up and get promoted to war chief.Eventually this makes things too easy, though. If you control a war chief and there's some other orc you want to kill, you can just tell your war chief to help you kill the other war chief and you would have to try pretty hard to lose that fight.So the Nemesis system is not perfect but it is definitely fresh and interesting and there is a lot of potential in the concept. Hopefully other games will follow in Mordor's footsteps by giving NPCs more soul. Mordor is just the beginning of the trend, and other games can hone and refine it.",Mistval

There's a special concern on the characters' construction: all of them have personalities and, by being barely seen with expressionless faces, there is a plenty lot of them that have an inner connection with the story denouement.Although made by a mainly cliché story where the hero save the princess, there are countless special features that makes the game beyond primordial and original. There are also enjoyable, time-lengthy side quests which turn The Legend of Zelda in a potential replay: you could finish it five times and there would still be something yet to be unveiled.

I've played this game for about a week, and on the whole, it feels rather average to me, as though it has several pros, it also has many cons.Pros:- Very large world / map to explore, with locations that are not necessary to questing, heightening realism and enjoyable for those who like to explore- Fast travel is nice because it allows you to save time travelling to places you have already been to, saving on wasted travelling time without actually cutting out the need to explore first- Large amount of side quests which mostly do not have to be done in a linear manner; quests also have some variety in type as they aren't all 'just kill this monster' quests- NPCs sometimes follow you around the house when you venture into their private areas, especially if you are sneaking, in an attempt to steal items, a very nice touch which makes stealing more difficult- The ability to craft armor and weapons, make potions and cook food are a good addition, as it adds more sophistication to the game- Decent, though not fantastic graphics- The ability to own a home, decorate it, and store items you don't want to carry or sell adds a personal touch to the game- The ability to joins certain groups / factions adds an identifying factor to the character you playCons:- Quests (in themselves) are very linear; most do not offer multiple options or diversions from the route to completion- Barely any attempt at a background or history for your character; race and gender have hardly any impact on the story in general, aside from some NPC comments here or there; your character has little to say at all times, and dialogue options are all straightforward and have no variety of choice based on character / attitude; character also has no movement or quirks that define personality- Character build (i.e. warrior, thief, mage) not distinct, and has no impact on quests or stories; NPCs will call you whatever they want - a mage calls you a mage, and an archer calls you an archer- The game is simply too easy - combat is extremely straight forward and the combat actions / graphics are highly limited; recovery is also pretty quick- Not many cinematic cutscenes to show off graphics or to expand on stories and make you identify with the game story / character(s)- NPCs are pretty dull - they lack character, either through back story or voice acting; you have little motivation to actually listen to them speak- Followers are even more dull - thorough lack of interest in followers as they seem to have little character, and few events to motivate you to want to have followers; you just have them for pack mules and additional fighting power; they act like robots (and my follower sounds downright rude in fact)- Characters can change armor in the middle of combat which removes realism from the game- Some glitches and problems with the game, such as weird graphics glitches, black screens upon alt-tabbing, occasional unfathomable crashes- NPCs and your followers do not move out of the way when you try to move past them - this can result in you getting stuck in a room when your follower is blocking the doorway (I ended up shoving them with my shield just to get them out of the doorway, thus hurting them in the process)- Inability to drop quests you don't want or don't like- Have to get around menus mostly using the keyboard; the mouse doesn't work on everything - console port?- No one-page-viewable character breakdown, showing how your character looks, his / her stats, EQ, possible states etc.- Inventory is clunky to use - you have to scroll down through each category to look for items, rather than having them all listed out clearly on a single viewable list; generally the UI is really inconvenient to use; time is wasted scrolling through stuff all the timeAll in all, Skyrim is a game that feels more like a simple intellectual exercise than one that engages your emotions.

You manage your settlements and armys on the campaignmap and fight huge realtime-battles on the battlefield. Settlement management is a HUGE improvement over Rome 2, you don't have uncountable options to upgrade your buildings (with only minor differences) anymore. I even prefer this system over Shogun 2, where npc's just upgraded their provinces which costs you food (a valiuable resource) when conquered - which you couldn't make unhappen, you had to live with that. But that doens't exist anymore. You now have buildings that make sense, you always know what to build. You have your buildings for military stuff and upgrades (eg. forges) as well as buildings for money, towngrowth, public order and so on.There is also no Food in the game as a resource besides Gold anymore, but Towngrowth instead (you need to get it to upgrade your buildings). I don't mind that change, it's neither worse nor better then before.I am a 40k fanboy, and I like fantasy universes as well, so I hadn't any problems to get used to this new setting, and I quite like it. I enjoy the huge unit variety, the monsters and heroes you get attached to when watching them ripping your enemys apart doing their questbattles to gain special armour and so on, all the new spells and abillitys are fun to use as well.It's super fun and it was almost impossible to stop playing this game for the last 7 days, always stayed up to 1 or 2am even when i needed to get up early the next morning. There is so much to do in this game and you always want to play only one more turn.Game on higher difficulties can be challanging, I played Shogun 2 for about 700h and I'm quite good at that kind of games. But I had a hard time to survive with The Empire on very hard, hardest faction for me so far, and I played (and finished) all exept Chaos and Vampires (playing them right now) on very hard.If the performance would be better, I would rate this game 8/10. It's pretty damn good, not perfect, but a improvement over Rome 2 (and partly even Shogun 2). I see myself playing this game for the next 1-2 weeks quite excessive.Co-Op-Campaign is fun as well.Graphics are fantastic 8/10Animations are gorgeous 10/10Performance is slightly under average 5/10I'm playing on high with a gtx780ti, i7, 16gb and my fps are jumping between 30-60fps, both on the campaignmap and while playing fullstack-battles. Sometimes your fps will drop for no reason and you have to tap out and in again to normalise it. Same goes for v-synch, when you have it on (to avoid really annoying screentearing) you will have some graphical bugs until you retab the game. You have to do this every single time you start the game. Also Fraps won't show you the fps when playing the game, thats pretty odd (you'll need to use Steam for that). After 70h of gameplay (already) I only had one single crash (when I started the game for the first time).Besides the performance there are only a few things that bug me out. Like diplomacy isn't that important in the game, most factions won't agree to whatever you offer them, exept they want it themselfs too, but on that occasion they will come to you to make you the offer (like trading, non-aggression-pakts, alliances and so on). So you pretty much can ignore diplomacy for the most part.Another thing that I find annoying is the fact that you have to spend all those points your heroes get after almost every single battle (up to 29 at level 30) as well as the items and followers you get for them (who give you minor bonuses in battles or on the campaignmap). You get them and even lose them almost every single turn. It's a clickfest and I completly ignore them by now and doing just fine on very hard.On harder difficultys I didn't find myself using agents a lot, I actually play without them. They are hard to level up, will very often fail their missions and will get killed by enemy agents anyway who will have a ton of them. They aren't worth their money in my book.Autoresolve is broken, you're better off autoresolving then fighting for your own, you still can win when the enemy has the favour. When I played Greenskins on very hard I overfoold the map with my ""Whaaags!"" and played 6 (!) battles manualy. Rest (about 120+ battles) where autoresolves. Greenskins where the most easie and fast to play race so far.Well that's it for so far, I hope my review helped some of you guys out.",ErobererZim

Borderlands 2 is a sequel to the outstanding 2009 game Borderlands.STORY: In the original game there wasn't much story going and not an actual antagonist you have to deal with but the borderlands 1 was still lovable to play. In Borderlands 2 the sequel takes place 5 years after the events of the 1st game. After finding out that the vault in pandora was just tentacles the original vault hunters decided to go their seperate ways however, what they didn't know in the vault was actually a resource material called eridium where it spit out precious minerals all over the planet. Hyperion took the mineral and was well known for discovering it despite what the original vault hunters gone through. An antagonist named Handsome Jack want to discover what other vaults could be discovered using the minerals. Thats when Jack wanted every vault hunter who wanted to look for a new vault get killed by him and his army. Four new characters replace the original vault hunters. They are Zero, Maya, Axton, and Salvador each with their own special abilities are trying to prevent Jack from achiving a greater vault.GAMEPLAY: Still outstanding as ever since the prodecessor. Borderlands 2 offer the 4 new characters their own abilites and how they will play like. Zero's ability is that he can turn invisible like Lilth only that she can turn Dimensonally invisible while Zero is invisible for real where he can go up to anyone unnoticed and deal massive damage on them. Maya is similar to Lilth she is a siren where she can hold enemies with her power and destroy them with elemental abiiltes. Axton resembles alot like Roland where he can throw turrets to give him back up or support on the battlefield. Lastly Salvador is a gunzerker who can dual-wield any gun he wants either a combination of sniper rifle, and rocket launchers or two of each. The amount of guns in the game are 100x more avaliable than the original. You can actually trade with other people either with a second character offline or online. You can trade it regular or by having to duke it out for it.OVERALL: I don't have any actual negative things to explain on borderlands 2 since it manages to improve itself over the prodecesssor.

I mean...the first one was terrifyingly dark at times (not actually scary) since it emphasized the crime AND thriller parts of ""crime thriller"" and the second one is a love story? Let me just say... the writing in this game is just as good as the previous installment. Continuously poetic and beautiful in nature, Max Mayne 2 builds on the characters we became familiar with in the first game and allows us to fall in love with them in this one. Instead of being a crime thriller, it's more of an action romance style game and it works so well on those levels. It's less about Max grieving and staying in the dark pit of despair and more about trying to climb out of it, reluctantly but still. There is great character growth that negates the bland character that the title promises. When I think ""Max Payne"" I think of some flat 80's action star gunning down enemies and shouting out one-liners like ""get ready for Max Payne!"" or some **** like that but these games have been emotional, thrilling, and truly remarkable narrative works of art. Yes, the gameplay is fun too and although it wasn't as impressive in that respect as the first game was for me, I still had a blast. It took me about 2-3 hours less than it took me to beat the first game which seemed rather underwhelming but there was a lot more variation, especially being able to play as two characters and see moments of time from both of their perspectives was a really unique experience that I rather appreciated. Bullet-time seemed HEAVILY nerfed, though, and I found myself staying away from it since it didn't offer the same Superman-like power that was offered in the first game.

Voice acting also is on point, and if you do like so, you can also download the original Japanese voice pack for free (from the store).The writing is also perfectly on point. The characters are all very well thought out, with a lot of depths to explore. The story itself is really interesting and engaging, and it starts right off (I was a little surprised that the first palace already had such a ""heavy"" tone to it).The cherry on top, in my opinion, are the cut-scenes that often times are really high quality anime clips. This ads a whole other dimension to the game.I know, this review sounded like the ramblings of a total fanboy, but Persona 5 really is an absolutely amazing game that you should not miss if you even have the slightest interest in (round-based) JRPGs.",dreamstate42

Item crafting was a new feature introduced in this installment. It becomes more satisfying as you gather more schematics and crafting materials. The customization options in the game go beyond just weapons and armors, but extend to your story, your main character and your base of operations at well.At the same time it's not without its faults like the aforementioned menu system. There is also the ""white noise"" that is too common with large scale RPGs, you know, collect these, go here, do that. I enjoy exploring the map as much as the next gamer, probably more as I consider myself a conpletionist, but even I got tired of scouring the terrain for a single item that has no effect on the story or the gameplay at large.Before I conclude, the maps are gorgeous and huge and immersive.

While the game can still be very challenging, it's something that can easily be overcome once you get the combat down properly.

First off, if you've never played Demon Souls (like me) and are still hung up about the notorious difficulty of the game, I advise you not to buy into the hype. While the game can still be very challenging, it's something that can easily be overcome once you get the combat down properly. I've never played Demon Souls before and I had heard a great deal about this game, so I decided to finally give it a go. The game is so thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to finish mainly due to the satisfaction that it brings when you overcome a new challenge. I've read several reviews where people say that the game is a chore and like ""eating brussel sprouts"" until you complete a challenge, whereas it turns into ""eating ice cream"". This could not be further from the truth. The game is CONSTANTLY like ""eating ice cream"", rewarding you at every turn with exciting new gear or spells to fuel you're ongoing push towards the final boss. I believe the IGN review has something along the lines of: ""If you play games for fun, than this game is not for you"". This statement is also extremely false and is very misleading to newcomers who are thinking about potentially purchasing this game. The game simply requires you to be more open-minded as well as patient in contemplating the best strategies to overcome certain situations and boss fights. The graphics of the game are gorgeous, giving players a huge variety of stunning environments ranging from murky catacombs to snowy fortresses set upon a mountainside. It's essentially an open-world experience, since you can go almost anywhere at anytime, but there's still a decent amount of linearity. If you stumble upon an area where the enemies take 15 hits to kill and are capable of killing you in 1-2, you probably shouldn't be at that area yet and should return there at a later time. The combat mechanics work extremely well, never feeling overly repetitive nor becoming a chore. The game tries to get players to ""bond"" with their weapons and develop a sort of attached relationship. I've definitely felt this before, as I was reluctant at one point in the game to cease using my Fire Spear that I crafted since the monsters were all basically immune to fire. The game has you select from one of many starting classes, which primarily only affect you're starting equipment and attributes (except the Pyromancer, who might be the only class that can utilize Pyromancy spells). Spells are an absolute blast to use and there's tons of variety for a myriad of situations in which they can be implemented. The storyline is almost nonexistent, save for a few cutscenes and cinematics here and there, but this does not hinder the experience whatsoever. It may even bolster it, depending on who you ask, granting the game a more ""realistic"" feel. It gives the sense that the storyline is essentially what a ""real"" hero's journey would be like, with many difficult trials and failures along the road to success. Let me be completely honest when I say this, however: you will die. You will die alot, but overcoming death in this game is part of the grand satisfaction I mentioned. You die to an extremely difficult boss, losing your souls temporarily (if you can recover your ""body"", similar to Diablo 2), come back, and annihilate the boss. These moments are uniquely crafted, leaving you feeling like you're on top of the world when you achieve them. The game is about as dark of a fantasy as you can get and leaves very little to no room for comedic relief, save for a few moments that are few and far between. The game's crafting system is addicting in many ways, constantly dangling that carrot in front of you to collect that last Titanite Shard to upgrade you're weapon. The game does, however, have some issues that are worth mentioning. My biggest complaint is the framerate tearing in certain areas and scenes of the game. Blighttown is the worst offender, making it close to maddening to explore without tilting the camera towards the ground. There are also some other sequences and boss fights that briefly experience this, but no other notables. Another issue I've noticed is sometimes a delayed reaction in the control scheme when activating items. During boss fights, timing is crucial, and when I press X to use my Estus Flask to heal myself, I expect my damn character to pop that baby open and drink instantly. Multiple times, I've done this only to see a 2-3 delay before my character finally drinks, and this is after I've resumed dodging attacks. My character has then stopped during an attack, and I either die or sustain a serious blow. This doesn't happen that often, but when it does, it's frustrating. Overall, Dark Souls is one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've ever had the pleasure of playing. If you're still hung up about purchasing it, give it a rent, and you may be pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended.",msherry9

As you spend more and more time with Isaac, you start to feel that you are in a very deep game, which continues to surprise you even after 30+ hours. You have to go through dungeons without dying and it's not an easy task. To complete the game you'll need to learn how to deal with the different monsters, how to preserve your resources and you'll also need to make a lot of strategic decisions. If you die, you start over. Luck also plays a heavy role which sometimes can be frustrating. It's possible to go through the game with weak items and powers, but a lot harder than with all the good stuff. So completion is not just the matter of skill in my opinion. I think the art style is great, it's simple but also very appealing if you can appreciate the bizarre and grotesque. It's not for everyone. Some may even feel disgusted. The only downside I can think of, is the time consuming nature of the game. It's hard to put it down if you get the hang of it.",Gamera

The storyline is more streamlined than previous entries, and the action starts from the first minute and never lets up. Even on ""easy"" or ""normal"" modes, expect great difficulty overcoming the hordes of zombies, lickers, and other slimy beasties that are clawing to have your entrails for dinner. Fans of the series will be cheering. However, any gamer not so willing to turn a blind eye to the many faults in RE5 probably won't agree. Control schemes taken verbatim from previous RE ports are best left to survival horror, and RE5 (no matter how badly it wants to be) is not survival horror. It is an action game, and as any thing trying hard to be something it's not, friction is obvious and frustration sets in quickly. The over-the-shoulder camera isn't suited for close-quarters combat, often leaving the avatar exposed to point-blank attacks on the left side that cannot even be seen. Far too often the game relies on QuickTime events instead of actual gameplay, but never telling you if you're watching a cutscene or playable stage, which often leads to you missing your button-mashing window and replaying the level from the last checkpoint. Your partner rarely seems helpful, and frequently runs off to other parts of the map only to die, causing both of you to go back to start. As well, your partner is allowed to revive you should you fall near death, but often they will be preoccupied or simply unresponsive and you die where you stand. Easily the worst trapping of ""traditional"" RE games is the limitations placed on your character's weapon/item carrying capacity, and RE5 is absolutely the worst of the bunch. Instead of an ever-expandable suitcase, a la RE4, your character and partner are limited to nine items each, which may sound like a lot, but it's far from it. When you take into account that each weapon takes up a spot, each box of ammunition takes up a spot, and your protective gear takes up a spot, it doesn't take very long into the game to get to the point where you are choosing between carrying a health aid or ammunition for your secondary weapon. I could go on for days about this game's faults, but the most unfortunate thing is that most of them seem intentional on Capcom's part to uphold the ""tradition"" of the series. Well, the series has always had some terrible aspects to it, and tradition alone is no logical reason to keep what could be a killer app mired in poor gameplay and design. Rent this one, folks. I beat it in three days, and have no desire to try it again.",AdamD

The writing is okay but it's not really the best: it's too cheesy and gets boring after a while, which is what people praise the most but I've seen better.At least it's no Final Fantasy level of crappy writing so it's definitely a plus.With that said, I expected this version to give more in terms of content: the original game is very short, clocking only around 6-7 hours unless you go for the other routes, but for what I've seen, it's the same exact game that you had on pc...so why would you buy it again if not for wasting money? Even a laptop could run this thing so the only reason I could recommend this game on ps4, it's because you don't own a computer!On top of that you could potentially get it cheaper on steam during sales, and while it's not expensive, the steam version is 5 bucks cheaper than the psn version. Again why bother?I really can't say much because this version is quite literally the same as the pc version, and the same **** there is applied here.. so yeah, just read pc reviews.

If you are not willing to put in many hours a few moments of pure frustration, read no more. This game is not for you. If you will not accept that defeat may occur in the most humiliating way, read no more. If you cannot accept that updates are made based on the most recurring needs, not your own, read no more.-- This game has massive potential, but the potential of any given match is determined by the players. If you want a perfectly even match, you cannot find it! The reason being that a 'perfect' match cannot exist! You will find matches that are so leaned one way that you stand no chance! However, that does not mean you should quit. The 'currency' of dota is build items. The more you have, the more money and/or time you have put in the game. Typically, items are awarded only to the best player of the winning team, but one can earn an item regardless if you are good enough. Just to put an example, I once had a game where 3 out of the 5 people on my team quit. This meant that odds were 100% I would lose. But i played well enough I was awarded an item.-- Valve is a large company. They simply could not support a customer feedback group large enough to help every single person within a timely manner. Sending something to valve only ensures that the said mail will be read at some point, not that you will get a reply. Many low reviews comment on the slowness of the updates. This is not true. Small updates are made almost constantly in a process called the 'balance changelog' which ensures that no hero/item is too powerful. Major updates, such as a new character or likewise feature are rare, but no rarer than in any other game!-- People will sabotage a game for their own. Many low reviews state that dota is horrible in every way. I would be surprised if the majority of these people did not play league of legends, a similar and fun spin-off of dota. Critics judge the game without comparison to others, it is their job. Meanwhile the rest of us cannot help our bias. I have mine, you have yours, and every other review on this page has theirs.-- Dota is, by no stretch of the imagination, perfect. It has its flaws, such as a community that for the most part I have found to be silent or polite, but with some nastiness found on any multiplayer game. Honestly, the community is better here than on any console shooter I've played. There are bugs that can ruin a game and that people claim exist forever (In reality valve does not tell you they are fixed, they just fix the bugs) and of course the matchmaking! Remember that while some matches are unfair, the computer is doing the best with what it has. The computer can only put you in a match for the regions you select with other people joining a game at the same time as you. Be kind to the robots. They will spare you in the uprising.-- People lie. If you believe every statistic given here, you are a fool. Many of the facts are true to a specific point in time far in the past, and many more are simply lies given by people who got beat up by a bloodseeker their first game and never played again.I hope this review has been helpful.

Fact is, the single player campaign is at least three times as long as the previous one; it features a couple of plot twists which will make you scratch your head and keep playing just to see what's going on; and new gameplay devices are introduced smoothly and expertly, never overwhelming the player. It's also interesting to see how Valve handled co-op mode: it's a whole new campaign by itself, and it features an indicator system that may not be as effective as using an actual headset, but it's surprisingly functional all the same. All in all, there's nothing wrong to be found  here... Unless you're so spoiled about game length to the point that 16 hours devoted to high quality gaming isn't as good as 40 hours managing inventory just so you can endure another 40 hours of medieval fantasy cliches.

These words are just a few of the memorable moments of not only the greatest game to grace our consoles this year..but a game in serious contention for one of the best games this side of the current generation of consoles.Not only was that sentence uttered by one of the most entertaining but disturbing villains of our time, Vaas Montenegro, but he continues this rant with a few choice swear words to explain insanity as repeating the same thing over and over again, I seen this as a subtle middle finger to the other first-person shooters of this generation, and who can blame anyone for believing this.Far Cry 3 not only changes the rules... it brings open-world gaming and first-person shooting together in a combined sense of beauty and realism that we rarely come close to seeing anymore in money spinning game-a-year blockbusters.We play as Jason Brody, an adrenaline junkie student who is participating in sky-diving holidays with a group of friends. This leads them to Rook Island, a beautiful paradise but with dire consequences waiting behind the green grass and deep oceans.What catapults this game above the likes of Assassin's Creed, is the sheer freedom involved here. Don't get me wrong, this takes many cues from AC, but this game deserves more credit for being truly open-world. Whether you are skinning animals to make larger weapon holsters, wrestling with a shark to stop it tearing you to shreds, or taking to the skies with a hand-glider or wing suit, the opportunities are endless. The map is incredibly large but used to its upmost potential, undiscovered ruins, caves, treasures or rare animals, FC3 is a force to be reckoned with. Beautiful landscapes with sprawling beaches and an excellent variety of vehicles make this a truly endlessly entertaining experience.Vaas is the clear standout of this game.. with not nearly enough screen time he isn't done justice but when he's there, he's there. A dangerously accurate personality,and mannerism combo similar to the cunning insanity of the Dark Knights joker, easily one of the most frighteningly terrific villains we've ever seen.With all this and much more..this is a truly unforgettable game that never ceases to amaze.",StevenF

But as of now, this game is easily one of my favorites. Throwing away the traditional style of war based combat, Splatoon goes for a more kid friendly approach that works greatly. The motion controls, while they would be a bit of a red flag to people, are very well implemented and extremely responsive but if you still don't enjoy them can be turned off. My only complaint is more of a nitpick, but the single player stuff in the game is very underwhelming as the story mode last around 4 to 6 hours and the local multiplayer I half the time forget about. As the core focus of the game is multiplayer though, it's good to see the devs were able to focus on that main aspect. Multiplayer is also a ton of fun with four modes to play and a ton of maps. The regular battle mode Turf War is short, simple, and can be played whenever. The other three modes Splat Zones, Tower Control, and Rainmaker, can be played in ranked depending on which are chosen. The few problems with multiplayer are a lack of voice chat between friends and the choice to choose which modes and maps you play on. Those are set on a four hour rotation and if you don't get the maps or mode you care for then the only thing to do is wait, which can be annoying. Voice chat not being in the game makes sense since it is meant for children, but talking between friends would make sense as games like Mario Kart 8 and Smash Bros Wii U have been able to do this. In the end, with the constant free updates of new weapons and maps to boot, Splatoon is an enjoyable experience just built around pure fun. It is easily one of my favorite games of this year and a must buy if you have a Wii U. And just cause it seems mandatory, TL;DR Splatoon is good. Go play it.",DerpyWalrus

Yes, you'll have to excuse some cartoonish exaggerations, but in the end I was amazed at the quality of the writing, always guiding you through Layton's current troubles and flashback scenes with masterful expertise.

When the inevitable ""moment of truth"" came down, I couldn't help but get goosebumps.But yeah, about the puzzles: don't worry, they're also super-fun and very clever. Out of the 130+ puzzle sequences in the main game, only half a dozen will fall flat as not making much sense, and the rest will get you wanting more. A lot of them are even entirely relevant to the storyline, and this helps the game feel cohesive as a whole.After hours and hours of devouring this game, I get to say what I wish I could say every time I jump late into a bandwagon: I'm gonna hunt down the early games and start my Layton experience from scratch.",ricklongo

The game's art style is breathtaking, and when coupled with the superb sound design, Transistor is able to draw you into its world and not let you go. Some of the stories strongest points come when it drives home how hopeless Red's situation really is. The game creates a sense of longing and sorrow that is deeply moving.The gameplay does not leave much to be desired either. If you've had the pleasure of playing through Bastion, Supergiant's previous game, you'll understand the basics of Transistor's gameplay style. The added 'planning' element adds some depth to more difficult encounters, but does little for the standard enemies you'll face. The leveling up is nice, but very simple (which could be a positive or a negative based on your feelings of RPG elements). Overall the gameplay is straightforward, and engaging. Though it lacks depth, it possesses a great deal of flair.The only large issue I had with Transistor, was the story. The themes of the story, the delivery of the narration, and the relationship between the two main characters, ranged from good to fantastic. Where the game fell short, was in the actual telling of the plot. While ambiguity used in story telling can allow the viewer/player/reader to draw his/her own conclusions, too much ambiguity can lead to confusion and/or lack of interest. Transistor seems to walk the proverbial line when it comes to this. Though thankfully the story never falls onto the 'side' of being too ambiguous.From the beauty of the artwork, to the amazing soundtrack, Transistor creates a world worth experiencing.",Shig

231497,Final Fantasy XIII,PlayStation3,6,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Final Fantasy XIII is a fun experience when your characters are under-levelled. I say this because grinding on this game makes it ridiculously passive and boring, the auto-battle feature is good when you're just trying to get through the game to see the story, but i don't believe that the story is worth it, the majority of the characters are awful and the conflict between them is often meaningless. The story itself is well thought out up until a certain part, but like most of the Final Fantasy games, they begin to turn into confusing, hard to follow nightmares. The characters are labelled as terrorists because of their mark from a Gran Pulse fal'Cie, they become l'Cie and must fulfil their purpose based on glimmers, they gather from their glimmers that they have been assigned the same task all the while being hunted by PSICOM, in spite of this, the characters decide to split up based on their interpretations of the purpose they are to carry out. After a short while, two of the characters end up being captured, the rest of the party are to rescue them, when their plan fails, the captured characters escape from their holding cell, the full party meets up to confront the game's main antagonist who turns out to be a fal'Cie. I'm not going to go through any further than that but i already know you're thinking what the f-. However, this does not mean that Final Fantasy XIII is a bad game, the strength of Final Fantasy games is generally in the music and this game lives up to the musical expectations everyone had for it. The combat in this game is very interesting and fantastic but was not utilised as well as it could have been, the paradigm system (basically a job system) and the staggering mechanic were excellent, but underutilised in my opinion and at a certain point in the game, all characters have access to all paradigms, essentially sacrificing the individuality of each of the characters, who in the beginning were clearly assigned a certain role (e.g. Lightning - Ravager, Snow - Sentinel, etc.), of course these characters were stronger at their assigned roles and had perks based on them but this made the game less enjoyable as a tactical game (deciding which characters to use in a boss fight, etc.).Overall, the game had great potential and was clearly well thought out, however, nearing the end, it was clear that this game was definitely not what it had players expecting, i enjoyed this game when i played it under-levelled and i noticed that the only major challenges i had with it were the end game activities, however these were repetitive and attempting to achieve the platinum trophy would be an impossible task for me because of how boring it becomes end-game. Because of the points I've listed and my personal experience with the game, i have decided to give Final Fantasy XIII a 6/10.",OraNGEMiST

I would buy a PS4 exclusively for this title, if I didn't have one already.Graphics - 9/10 - Perfectly suited to the game. Suffers from some mild invisible-wall syndrome, but totally within reason. Beautiful, imaginative environments, and no framerate slow-down.Sound - 10/10 - One of the best action OSTs of all time, in my personal opinion. The voice acting was believable and endearing, and the sound effects were seemless.Gameplay - 10/10 - Smooth, crisp, engaging combat. The regularly changing perspectives and genre blending hold the players' attention well, creating a constantly diverse and exciting experience. The level-up system is simple yet provides incredible freedom, and each weapon class is unique enough that combat feels satisfyingly different with each possible combination.Story - 10/10 - I don't usually play games for their stories, but I couldn't help myself with NieR: Automata. It was rife with intrigue, the characters were charismatic, the plot was deep and raised many appealing existential questions. NieR: Automata presents one of the best stories, and some of the best character interactions in a video game to-date.Some may ask ""Why are you hyping this game up so much?"" The answer: It's been so damn long since I played a Triple A game of this calibre. It excites me that this game exists, because it means that other games of the same quality are possible. It gives me nostalgia, whilst feeling up-to-date, and presents a serious plot credibly, whilst maintaing a fantastic sense of humour during side-quests and throughout. In NieR: Automata, moving is fun, fighting is fun, levelling up is fun, questing is fun, fishing whilst listening to the OST and admiring the landscape is fun. It's just damn good fun all-round, and I can't find anything about that disappoints me.Buy it. Don't miss this one. It's a standard-setter.",DeadbeatJesus

Be it a huge impact, an unforgettable memory, or an intense experience like nothing before. For one reason or another, there is always something noticeably more special than everything else. This does not happen very often, but on the day Mass Effect 2 released, it did.Mass Effect 2 expands on the original formula of creating your character, gathering a squad, and having the universe at your hands. Literally everything that unfolds after is your choice, it is on your shoulders, and there are consequences. Normally games like KOTOR or Jade Empire (which utilize this choice of response system) are very clearly defined between good and bad. There is no shade of grey, there is just right and wrong. The beauty in Mass Effect is that there really is no right or wrong choice, it is simply the player's choice. This feature, making it feel as though it was an interactive movie playing out rather than a game, makes for one of the most unique and deep role playing experiences gaming has to offer.The original Mass Effect was considered an awesome game, though it had it's share of problems holding it back. Texture pop-ups, loading times, bland side quests, and rather mediocre gameplay all kept it from being what it truly could have achieved. It was not a bad game by any means, but it was clear that more work was needed. What BioWare has done since the period of Mass Effect 1's release and Mass Effect 2, is fix, or rather, completely get rid of all previous problems.The texture pop-ups? There are none. In my 40 plus hours of playing, there has not been a single issue with the graphics appearing properly. Loading times? Long elevators? How about five second load screens and no elevators at all? The side quests have been elevated to the scale where they are cinematic and made just as important as the story in presentation. There is no Mako to explore worlds, making these simplifications give the game a much more fluid and polished feel.The best improvement by far, is the gameplay. No longer being a bland, non-challenging system where you have cover but never use it, Mass Effect 2 relies on cover the way Gears of War does. You can rarely run out in the open and try to play this like the first game without proper armor, defensive powers, and precaution. No longer can you pile up every overpowered power in your arsenal on enemies to dispose of them in seconds. They have made it balanced and smooth. The guns all feel different, the classes all feel VERY different, and the restrictions to which class can use which guns/powers is very well done. You could barely tell the difference between classes in the original, but in the sequel, you would have to be blind not to.One thing that was awkward about such a dialogue, story-telling game in the first Mass Effect was the character expressions. The voice acting was superb (and is even better now), but the feel of immersion and belief was sometimes lost with the faces of character models being utterly inexpressive. Someone would raise their voice and their face would look like they just ate a rotten apple, it made no sense. Luckily this was all greatly remedied in the second game and there is no loss of feeling in these scenes. The camera was even made more cinematic in comparison to the static camera in the first game, which gives it a much improved cinematic scope.Furthermore, the character development itself has improved greatly. BioWare did a good job with the cast of the first game, but in the second, not only is the main squad more endearing, but even the NPCs come off very entertaining and interesting. I found myself applauding the backstory of each character, and I even enjoyed the logical development of characters from the first game greatly.Speaking of developing from the first game. Mass Effect 2 is really something else. Players can import a completed save game from the original (which means you HAVE to play both otherwise your gamer pass is revoked) and all their choices from the original carry into the second game. This is no exaggeration. EVERYTHING, every little thing you may have wondered the consequence or benefit of carries through. Playing Mass Effect 2 without importing a character or without having played the first one just isn't the same experience.It's the little things, the realism of the universe itself that BioWare has put together which makes Mass Effect 2 a nearly perfect game and easily one of the best games ever made and the 2010 Game of the Year. The gameplay, graphics, story, atmosphere, soundtrack, voice acting, everything about this game is absolutely amazing. Missing out on this is missing out on a great part of gaming history.",Super-Evil-DOOM

The bug is related to a mission where you need to recover a vehicle: as I died after getting back that vehicle, but before being able to bring it to final destination, I'm stuck into the mission as the the vehicole is not in existence anymore and I'm not allowed to ""Exit Mission"", as doing that simply bring me back to last saved checkpoint. And the suggested solution from the support team is to just cloud your saves often. Because yeah, I pay 60bucks to being forced to backup save each half an hour or so. Additionally the game suffers some fps drops even on PS4Pro and the manual save simply don't works.The game ""per se"" is still a good FarCry staple, plenty of activities and stuff to do, even if way too chaothic if the randomizer decide to strike hard on you (try to stay at a crossroads for few minutes, and you'll probably won't be able to move around anymore due to the amount of enemy vehicles will ammass in the area, just because they pass by and get involved in gunfight), with some nice new way on how acquiring objectives works. The graphics are very good (as long as you don't fly) and the gameplay is solid (the story is a bit of a meh, even if it does offers interesting bosses, opposed to the basci enemies that are so repetitive it hurts) but none of these good aspects are truly innovative and surely don't balance Ubisoft abitude to release unfinished, unpolished retail products.",Zanfire

I never was able to get my hands on the first installment but played the second all the time at a friends house and was infatuated with it.  Needless to say I was quite ecstatic when Diablo III was announced along with the rest the die hard fans and PC gaming community as a whole (I mean come on, it's Diablo, everybody was pumped).  Now here is where I will be brief for the sake of being succinct; I do not even begin to the fathom the reason of the negativity.  Diablo III is more than a solid game, it is a worthy successor to iterations past and continues Blizzard's legacy of impeccable game design.  It is game designed so meticulously and with attention to detail that it warrants nothing less than praise  from the sound design, to the visuals, the feel of each class, and most of all the loot system.  I don't see how you can a more accessible but still fundamentally deep game that plays as well as Diablo III.  Sure, one could argue the story is a little melodramatic and that the DRM thing is a little annoying (especially given the game's shaky launch) and the the auction house detracts from the end game...but here is the thing, this is Blizzard.  What do I mean by that? Blizzard is a company committed to it's games and fans  they will release patches, the game will get increasingly better.  This not only has happened  (introduction of the Hellfire Ring, Monster Power, and Paragon) but will continue to happen (PvP, Matchmaking, More End game questing).  I think ultimately the community is griping because of server side issues and a system that can be completely ignored (the Auction House).

Now that Arkham Asylum has been brushed, I am not just a fan of the universe but I absolutely love and adore it. Part of my love for Arkham Asylum stems from the wide assortment of valuable collectibles strewn around Arkham Asylum. Whether it's audio diaries or riddler trophies or challenges, the game digs deep with a heavy and rich emphasis on Batman lore. This lore really engrosses the player into the universe and into each individual character, detailing the villain's irrational histories. The gameplay is an impeccable highlight too. Batman has an assortment of punches, kicks and special takedowns which can be all chained into combos and you can wrack up glorious counter kills. The AI is challenging, but only in packs. One thing the gameplay particularly nails, is the changing up and the variety mix of enemies you'll encounter- forcing you to think strategically about each encounter. If there's any conceivable criticism, it's that some of the boss fights are a bit too easy, especially the one involving poison Ivy. Also the island does come down as being a bit too restrictive for my liking. But for the sheer amount of epic moments involving Scarecrow, Killer Croc and other batman villains, along with the vitality of Arkham Asylum through the numerous facilities and the levity inducing characters (not forgetting the outstanding performance of the Joker) Arkham Asylum is absolutely fantastic, and an absolute must by.

I played the multiplayer Beta and was unimpressed by the hit-and-miss servers, the overly bright sunlight and ""detached"" feel to the experience. It looks like they fixed the brightness.... and little else. The multiplayer isn't a battle simulation or a full-on FPS, it is a combination of both, unfortunately not in a good way. There are glitches when using vehicles and inside buildings.Co-op campaign - I played this with a friend. You feel isolated, as though you are the only two soldiers in the world fighting an oncoming army whilst everybody watches.Single player campaign - The graphics range from excellent high-quality HD to cartoony, blocky and basic. To aid realism you have to peer through scratched glass and deal with 'lens flare'. Whilst this does add to the realistic feeling it ultimately makes for a frustrating game where your vision is obscured a lot of the time and you miss out on the action and enjoyment. In summary, I would say the game looks a little rushed (to beat the release of COD - MW3?). Graphics in places are really not up to the current standard for a top-of-the-range modern FPS. Having said that, it is better than some and would have looked better stacked against games from 3 years ago. I wish I had waited until January and picked up a cheap copy.",Reddy71

I don't understand why a game developer develops what is essentially a point and click game, for a device that is made for the point and click mechanic and doesn't implement it.

When you combine them together though... it just sucks you in. I can't recall the last game, that kept me chained to my PC for so long.Graphics: nothing special compared to some titles this year in visuals department, but they do create a certain climate, which keeps you playing. Props to the game designers for not copy-pasting everything everywhere. Locations look different, they all have their style.Story: You can clearly see moment, when story designers tripped over their own legs. Four options dialogues are acceptable, but sometimes the choices you pick have nothing to do with what the character says. Your character has a voice! A nice one too... :) I like the way story unravels and the plot twists. I'm so swamped in side quests however, that I didn't really push that forward too much. I hate the idea of repeating quests (like for the BoS), but they keep pointing me to new locations, which is nice. I wonder if they ever run out of them and I'm inclined to check :).Building: This is actually the boring part. Yes, it's fun to build your own house. Even if it has to look like a shed (because there's no normal parts). Even if it's bugged and sometimes you have to redesign everything, because pieces, that should fit together just don't. It's not fun to run around all the encampments and keep building crap to make people happy. What kind of settlers are they if they can't even build themselves a bed? :)Crafting: That's how you do it. It's really awesome.Power armor: We all know how important that part is in every Fallout. I hated Power armor designs in F3 and FNV, they basically looked like jackets. Power armor should look like a tank on foot. We finally got it. A power armor, that looks like a tank. The fusion core system, which limits Power Armor usage is also very nice... but I'll end the game with a hundred cores left, because I'll hoard them till the end. Obviously ;).Map: The map is really nice, even though it's small. I wouldn't complain about a bigger and emptier map. Sometimes things are right on top of each other and you have to zoom in to choose the proper location to fast travel to.Companions: Not much to say yet, I spent most of my time with Codsworth the family robot. I really like Nick Valentine thouth. Then there's this lady from Combat Zone, which seems interesting, but I heaven't had the chance to meet her properly yet. The dog despite getting so much publicity is useless.Character development: I like the new system. I liked the old system more. I liked F1-FT system even better. I started playing Wasteland 2 Director's Cut two days before I got F4 in my hands and it made the difference even easier to see. The new system is oversimplified. Also I found out you can actually choose any perk in the tree around level 24 and there's no respec. I grinded my way down the perk vault through skills I'm never gonna use.

The new stages were a treat to the eyes, they have street fighter art all around them in cool ways. Online mode brings from great changes, and the Team Battle was something I was having fun with. My only concern is the fact that any number of players can pick whatever team they want, leaving the possibility for a 7-on-1 match. I feel like capping the team size is something that needs to happen. The online training mode is something that I feel like a lot of people have wanted for a while, and I think it will help newer players far more than the offline mode.

It's a good game, but pretty clear that most traditional media outlets have thrown out high praise because the name on the box is ""Zelda"".  Aesthetics are 2006-ish.  Combat controls are very clunky; if you're used to PS/XBox standard controls for RPGs, then you'll struggle a bit to feel confident with BOTW's archaic controls.  I'd compare it to playing Resident Evil 7, then going back to play original Resident Evil.  BOTW's controls aren't *that* bad, but do command a significant adjustment period as you accidentally jump into an enemy sword swing instead of dodging right/left a few times.  So far, the puzzles are pretty easy.  Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask had far, far more challenging puzzles and those games are almost 20 years old.Exploration is fantastic.  I find myself constantly wanting to check that next hill, the next ruin, that little forest up ahead...it's addictive and enticing.  This is *the* selling point of the game for me.  Many times I've wanted to quit for the session only to be subliminally called to explore that next spot just up ahead.The lack of durability of various weapons is maddening and is the worst aspect of the game.  Swapping weapons every couple minutes makes combat a major annoyance.  I find myself just avoiding combat if at all possible; thus, exploration becomes a bit of a walking simulator for me with minimal interaction with the game's various baddies.  If you're the kind of gamer that wants to take out all the bad guys in an area (a sweeper if you will), then this game's weapons mechanics will piss you off more than once as you dutifully pick off the baddies.If you've played Zelda games before, this one's worth a try (on a Wii U for sure; only if you want to throw away $400 on a Zelda machine for the Switch).  If you haven't played Zelda before, I'd recommend waiting for a sale or an inevitable Game of the Year Edition that'll include the various DLC Nintendo will be pumping out for it.  It's a good game, but there's nothing here you haven't seen done better before in other RPGs.",KJosey

The story is compelling, the characters are interesting, the writing is (mostly) excellent and combat is a fun challenge.The challenge with this game is this: it isn't flashy.

You need to let your imagination take over for what other games accomplish with flashy cinematics and motion capture.This is a game to be imagined as much as played, and that is by no means a bad thing. But, if you aren't willing to settle into the slower pace, you will probably think of this game as a waste of money.

113670,Mass Effect 3,PC,4,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Mass Effect 3 has probably the most convoluted, lore destructive, narrative disaster of story telling I've seen in recent years. Despite few good episodes involving geth and the krogan it really isn't anything good. Introduction was confusing and not following the lore and events after the Arrival DLC, it's not the best decision if Bioware wanted to market this more towards the masses. Secondly, what was the point of ME2 if only in ME3 we are introduced with probably the most narrative breaking Deus Ex Machina device I have ever seen - the Crucible. No one knows what it does or what its for, except the hope, that this big clunk of metal can defeat antagonists - the Reapers. Shouldn't the trilogy had gone like this:ME1 - introducing the threatME2 - learning how to stop a threatME3 - stopping the threat Again, ME2 serves no purpose.Cerberus and their motives are as confusing as the whole TIM indoctrination by the reapers. What was the point of reapers letting to play with their mind game toys if they later on they destroyed the whole facility?The whole lore is utterly destroyed. Alliance are idiots, Cerberus are idiots, Reapers are idiots and Shepard is an idiot. ME1 epic was changed into ME2 space opera.And now the ending... Ugh.. Do I even have to start? It was the worst thing I've ever seen in story telling. The Extended Cut DLC, believe it or not, made it even worse. The ending single hand destroyed the ME1 lore, let me question Alliance strategies how to take down Reapers, and finally made antagonists into complete an utter morons. Not only the main theme was destroyed, but the fact that reapers wants to save us from ourselves by committing mass genocide of entire galaxy is the most logic breaking nonsense I've ever heard. I see what writers tried to do here, showing as much ideas and philosophies in to the main narrative, but they just didn't work, because of poor writing. So what we got is a third person RPG shooter with refined shooter elements, but extremely poor execution of RPG elements. The Quest system is probably the second worst thing in the game, it is completely broken, so is the customization. Multiplayer inclusion wasn't necessary at all.Overall its a convoluted package of nonsense. 2/10",HomeCritic

It doesn't lag often though, just in a few places where the atmospherics get crazy. 2. SOME (not all) of the new features are a bit silly.

174436,Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm,PC,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        From what i've seen through walkthroughs, the game is good, good enough to be considered a very good sequel to WoL. The new units are pretty decent too, with the Viper being my favourite add-on(can pull entrenched siege tanks and swiftly turn the tide of the battle in favour of the zerg player) Countless new strategies in multiplayer are avaliable, and if you are smart enough, you can destroy a entrenched position easily using the new units. Overall, the modifications made to the multiplayer are very good, and mass siege tanks or void rays can not be enough now, to win a multiplayer game.The campaign is equally good. What I liked most is the hero system of Heart of Swarm: You control Kerrigan in virtually every mission. She is revived at free cost at the Hatcheries and is almost as powerful as the old QoB unit of WoL(though i feel that  the new system of evoluting Kerrigan is overpowered, and despite being similar to the WC3 system, its almost twice as powerful than the latter system.) When Kerrigan reaches level 80, you will simply bring destruction in the campaign maps with almost no cost. Through i like swift destruction, however. Also I strongly like the concept of invading planets with strains very useful to fuel the evolution of the Swarm.The story is good, focused on Kerrigan revenge against Mengsk, and telling us more of the hybrid enigma. I don't really care about voice making or something like that, but I think that the actors have done a great job(both representing the talks and the voices). Through the game is relatively very good, the cinematics simply excel. Film-like quality, and excellent  representation. The cinematics also reveal the new personality of Kerrigan  and that's what I like most.I haven't bought the game yet, but believe me, if you like Starcraft 2 enough to consider it as one of the best RTS strategy games of all time, this expansion is a must-buy for you. You'll not regret it. Overall I rate this game a strong 8.8/10.",Lazy_Ninja

While providing another title for the RPG-deprived Xbox, the true fan will most likely find more comfort in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Story/Plot: The biggest complaint with the storyline is that it was too short. It is the basic genre of boy is separated from family and seeks revenge. Fable seemed to be an attempt at a true action-defined RPG that seemed to fall short of its mark. While providing another title for the RPG-deprived Xbox, the true fan will most likely find more comfort in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Story/Plot: The biggest complaint with the storyline is that it was too short. It is the basic genre of boy is separated from family and seeks revenge. The one unique concept is that you start off the game as this young boy only to find yourself at adulthood within the first half hour of playing. This should of been a tip-off at how quickly the storyline would continue to move. (7 of 10) Game Control: The game control seemed to have some flaws as well. Again, well conceived, but never really felt completely comfortable. Moving around Fable was performed via fixed path maps with fairly long load times and regenerating enemies. Enemies were targeted using the left trigger which never seemed to completely work just right. It seemed far too often either an enemy wasn't selected and you were caught facing the wrong direction or the wrong enemy would be chosen putting you in harm's way for a wide-open attack. On the positive side, the magic system was well designed and the navigation sysytem for conversation and item use was fairly easy to use. (5 of 10) Graphics: For the most part, the graphics were very good. It seemed to be your typical xbox game-engine generated effects. (7 of 10) Sound: I thought the soundtrack to the game was one of the best features. Most of the musical scores fit the mood and scenery. My only complaint was the repetitive booming voice of the guildmaster reminding your character to heal up or pick up a guild card. (9 of 10) Misc: Hmmm... The intangibles. After finishing the game, I felt there was necessity to finally get a game that was three-quarters complete to the market with some of the rough edges not completely smoothed out. A couple features that I think stood out was the trading system and the ability to domesticate (marry, buy and sell homes, improve an existing home). I think were the game fell short was in content, especially in sub-quests that could have provided a lot of extra hours of gameplay. Overall, this is a game that would be worth waiting for it you intend to buy it. It is far too expensive at $44.95 (Amazon) for a game that is truly beatable in less than 10 hours.

Probabaly the absolute best single player game of all time. If you are looking into this game for SP, then its a no brainer.However, next we have ""GTA Online""Its a mixed review.I have a lot of hours into online and I will continue to put a lot of additional hours into online.PROS:It gets constant content added several times a year the release ""free"" DLC'sThere really is a lot to do, if you wish you can really role play the most corrupt criminal to the fullest extent.CONS:I'll just start out with the biggest con.The game has clearly taken a big turn in the last couple years and its intesifying toward micro-transactions.Its pretty obvious, the keep raising the prices of items you purchase in game, compared to the amount of money you earn. Unless you are dedicating your life to this game, its pretty hard to obtain the in game items. And if you are starting out as a new player, the amount of money you need to catch up is really a huge obstacle.I am not one of those people who are defiantly against micro transactions, but these aren't even fair micro transactions.Rockstar keeps raisning the price of the in game items, but the amount of money given out on a ""shark card"" has never been adjusted.Here is an example, a 8 Million dollar shark card (unless on sale) costs $99 always has.It use to be that most items were under 1 million with the extremely high dollar things around $2 million.So for $99 you could typically buy say 5-15 items for $99.Fast forward to today.Most items are over 1 million closer to 2 million on average) and the most expensive items are 4 million with a yet to be released item that is going to be 6.5 million. Rockstar is really going for a money grab here and they aren't even attempting to hide it. Not to mention that the latest DLC the amount of money you can earn per hour has actually gone down from the previuous ones. So higher prices to buy stuff, lower income from doing work. So you are forced to not really play the new DLC but the old ones for cash. Which is a shame because the new missions are actually very fun, they just dont pay well.So if you are new and want to ever come close to catching up to current players you have 3 choices. 1.) Buy Shark Cards and ALOT of them. Several hundred dollars worth. 2.) Play an insane amount of hours, quit life and play this game every day, all day long 3.) Cheat - Find mods or a modder and get ""modded money"". Warning you can actually get banned for this. I cant even beleive I am giving this advice out, I use to depise money modders, but given the greed coming out of Rockstar now days, I really understand why new players would do it, and I dont frankly care anymore.So you might ask, Why do I have this game as recommmened still.When it comes down to the game itself, single player and even online.It's fun, there is a lot of varitey, I can do missions, I can race cars, I can pvp, I can play mini games (and there are dozens of varietys of games) I've played 600 hours and honeslty still to this day havent even played 1/2 the things you can do. There is a massive amount of content. The game is fun.The politics behind the scenes is horrible, the comminity is toxic, and the micro tranactions are getting out of control. But at the core its still fun and I still enjoy it after all this time.But on the other hand we probabbaly wouldnt get all these updates without the microtransactions, so there is that factor too.I rate GTA 5Single Player gameplay:10/10Online Gameplay:8/10 (-2 for community)Variety of things to do:10/10Game Updates:8/10Microtranactions:1/10",Kayla45

Die hard fans will want a full sim, 100% race length, authentic damage and full customization of your car, more casual fans, or those who just want to jump in and play a quick 5 lap race also have that option. The weather factor is also cool as it greatly affects the tracks and how the car handles just like in real life and you really feel like you're driving on slick pavement. This isn't a game you can just go all out and bounce off the walls and keep going, your car will get destroyed and your race will be over. However, if you're a lead foot, there is a rewind option similar to forza where you can rewind back a few seconds and get a 2nd chance at making that pass or making that turn. The game isn't perfect, there's some minor graphical glitches but those are mostly after race presentations. The crew chief's voice coming through the controller speaker is also a nice touch.",325_hawks

I do believe this is the closest game to greatness for the rpg genre, for me, in 30 years. I have loved jrpgs, turn based (Divinity:OS is good), fp based like Elder Scrolls, but no game has inspired pure enjoyment like this since I was a kid playing Bard's Tale III.Sure the character crafting and advancement is very console like, but this game's mechanics and questing is just too enjoyable. The visuals are spot on. They are not pushing boundaries, but are at the leading edge so that the game looks beautiful and plays the same (provided you have good hardware). Many have experienced bugs, I have not run into a single one and am playing at 5760x1080 in crossfire. Not a single crash, tear or glitch. That is remarkable to me given all the complaining around.To be sure a character might stand on a tent, or do something impossible, but this, in my opinion is due to the novel use of verticality in the game. Because you can jump and climb, the NPCs have to be able to move to places otherwise not anticipated in an attempt to stay with you. That is not a flaw. It should not bother you.I am about 15 hours in and am still not off the first primary objective map as they are just an unending number of things to do, each one interesting and each one worth the exp points.To speak a bit to combat, it looks beautiful and the magics are presented in a very fun and controllable way. The only admitable problem I could see, some truly hardcore gamers may find the combat a bit too easy. For me, I only have time to drop in and out of this world, so mastery is hard. This combat is fun and intuitive, but not simple, h & s crap like DA2. It has good balance. You can make combat more or less strategic too your likely with some limitations. Overall, it is really fun.The only complaint....WTF, bears are your ultimate nemesis, they can f-stuff up for you when you are trying to do something completely unrelated. Come on, a bear, I am running from a bear cause I know it is a fight that is gonna piss me off?! Not that you might lose, but someone is gonna need to heal, and if you are wounded heading somewhere you might run into one and the only thing you can say is WTF, a bear, now really, go away bear!In my opinion, this a rare game where the critics have it right and the users don't.

Honestly I'm probably going to forget the experience but i really enjoyed it and I think anyone who bought a new 3ds who has lots of time to invest into this game will enjoy it.Don't misunderstand though I'm not saying anywhere that you need to upgrade to a new 3ds. That transition will come in time but right now it's unnecessary for lots of people so don't stress out about it. And by the time you need to upgrade the game will be significantly cheaper so you better pick it up then.Also little side note it does help if you just SLIGHTLY spoil yourself nothing major stay away from 7 because honestly to get started you do need a large amount of surprise and intrigue to get into the groove of this game.

The audio in general (from guns to a planet’s ambient soundscape) is immersive and suiting.The various environments are enchanting yet properly exhibit the magnitude of an enormous sci-fi war.  Most “skyboxes” look glorious, though extensively littering the playable sandbox with innumerable crates/boxes and foliage still does not successfully hide how barren it can sometimes feel.   Regardless, the landscape is a considerable improvement over vanilla Destiny.Level design is, overall, an upgrade from the first Destiny; although it still could use some renovations – objective routes could be even clearer, and, in my opinion, arenas could be even more interactive (this includes player controlled hazards/vehicles/turrets/environmental platforms) and further optimized to fully utilize a guardian’s abilities/mobility (more scenic parkour/platforming segments).Nearly all instances of voice acting matched the persona of their characters and was delivered quite well (looking at you Nathan Fillion).Gunplay, which is nearly completely identical to the first Destiny, is topnotch.  Responsive, intuitive, and visually appealing (with respects to controller capabilities); it shines with a AAA polish.Negatives:The enemy A.I. is appalling.  Perhaps the game’s MMO element creates a bit of lag inhibiting their awareness, or maybe they were designed to be extra passive as to make players feel super stealthy, but repetitively dancing a few inches behind them really makes me feel as though they aren’t really the threat that the story tries to convince me of.  The pathing is equally horrendous (watching 100+ enemies funneling through a tight corridor to seemingly blind fire worse than bad guys from a Schwarzenegger film made me feel both humored and disappointed).  The impression of engagements was anything but engaging.Post Taken King, most developments of “core gameplay” in Destiny’s sequel seemed fairly minimal.  Really should expect more with a $60 price tag (as opposed to cheaper DLC) – particularly because there was certainly room for notable improvement (even from a creative standpoint, like completely new alternative classes).I did not find the “grind” too enjoyable.  The monotony of easily slaying abysmal A.I. became a killjoy, especially after completing the story missions.  Though the recent raid was fun, it came a bit late, and was not nearly a good enough payoff for the hours it took plowing through the same public events whilst praying to the RNGod’s for something beneficial.  The threat of boredom is tenfold to solo players.The writing, from the plot to the dialogue, was unoriginal, tacky, and meek.  I would assume most are content that there is at least an attempt at a story in Destiny 2 since there was an obvious lack of one in the first, but that doesn’t excuse how meager it is— being relatively better (story wise) does not inherently make it good.  I’ve read plenty of free fan stories and theories discussing the Destiny universe that were leagues better than the oversimplified clichéd nothingness we paid for.Narrow F.O.V.  30 FPS.  (Console capabilities really do hurt the potential experience in this regard).Various bugs (i.e. invisible enemies/players)/glitches/crashes.Aesthetically, endgame characters never really looked as “cool” as I wanted them to (nor as they probably could be) even with the shaders.  I often felt various enemies looked much better than I ever could.Microtransactions/Consumable shaders.  Greedy, unnecessary, and ultimately makes some consumers feel skeptical of being treated wallet-friendly by Bungie/Activision in the future.Story was much too short (took me 4.5/5ish hours casually).  I’m expecting expensive DLC to satisfy that shortcoming.I would’ve liked to have experienced a newer and wider assortment of enemies/bosses.On PVP: some gun balancing issues, p2p is suboptimal, I’m not sure why 6v6 had to be dropped (even as an option) entirely, and arenas could be enhanced artistically (perhaps even redesigned for better combat flow).Conclusion: I was absolutely looking forward to purchasing this game on PC (despite my better judgment).

Now I am not complaining as much as a warning. it`s still getting 9/10 because I am fine with the grinding you need to do in the first level.  Besides that the only changes in your character are the colors and their weapon. This is really sad in comparison to the amazing amount of leveling and stats you can invest in and unlike most games where they give you the whole ""2% increase bull"" you can  actually see the changes in your character and towers.

As soon as I hit the New Game button, I realized I was in for something unique. Of the aspects of Bioshock, by far the most awesome, was the story, intricately woven into the fabric of the continuity of the lore. Without giving away any spoilers, I would have to say that Bioshock is without a doubt, the strongest narrative I have ever heard/seen in a video game. The gameplay is equally incredible. Granted, as some of the reviewers have noted, the plasmids are a bit unbalanced.Two of the plasmids, Incinerate and Electric bolt, are almost undefeatable, and one could when the game with nothing but them, however the real enjoyable portion of Bioshock, is freezing an enemy and shattering them to bits, or throwing hives of bees at them, and watching them writhe in pain. The weapons, however are perfectly balanced. An combined the weapons/plasmids system is one of the most efficent combat systems I have seen in an FPS. One thing that annoyed me was the Karma system, which many called an RPG system. The whole conflict with the Little Sisters, while unique just doesn't have the moral implications that it does the first time you do it. By the time that you're harvesting/saving three per level, it becomes routine. Another problem I had with the game was the hacking system. I seemed like a good idea gone terribly wrong. Eventually you do get Auto-hack for some items, but even so, hacking vending machines and safes can be frustrating. Finally I must comment on the graphics. The water effects are incredible, some of the finest yet to grace the platform. Overall, with a pricetag of 20, I wouldn't hesitate to get this game.",DanielF.

Along the way though you might come across other monsters wandering around and it's up to you whether you take them on or not. So far, so good.But once you find the monster this is where things go bad. For all the tactics and brilliance of the RPG side the combat boils down to button-bashing. I also come back to my opening statement of the lack of a jump button; one of the main ways to attack a monster is to get on it's back and start stabbing away but the problem here is there is no way to actually jump. To be able to get on a back you have to manoeuvre the monster near a ledge and then ""hope"" you jump off the ledge toward the monster, it's more luck than judgement if this happens. Add in the lack of a health bar on the animals and you're at times literally stabbing in the dark.To sum up: a great game spoiled by the combat system.",That986

It dark, gritty and sad but also funny, light and happy at times. It rides the line and what is that line? I don’t even know.The game starts off with something that was so emotionally draining, right off the bat it was an emotional punch to the gut. While I was sitting next to my dog in real life, I had to shoot B.J. Blazkowicz’s (main characters) childhood dog. Oh man, that was such a tough moment, I was not emotionally prepared for that. After that, the game gets emotionally gets easier to swallow.After the game’s intro, things start to pick up narratively but everyone still remains to be very gloomy.  As the game progresses you meet Super Spesh and Grace who are just trying to survive. Upon their arrival, things start to look like they’re improving and also with Super Spesh he brings some much-needed light-hearted humor.  Before they arrived it started to feel like the game was taking itself way too seriously.I hate to be so vague with everything in regards to the story because there are so many things I want to talk about but I don’t want spoil anything. The game has a tone and then about two-thirds of the way through the game there is a major tonal switch. It goes off the rails crazy and what it does it gets me so excited for the sequel.It pains me to say this but the weakest part of this game is the gameplay. There is not a great difficulty setting. There are six settings and two through 6 are harder than you want them to be. This is a game that you want some resistance but you don’t want to get stuck in a certain level. This is a game that only flows well when its actually flowing, you want things to progress and move along. The problem with the first difficulty it was too easy. I know it sounds nit-picky but the key to have a great game is having the right difficulty setting.The gameplay itself, you can dual-wield any weapon and it’s satisfying enough. Depending on the ammo, I was constantly switching up the combinations but it was fun rocking machine gun and shotgun. As I said before I put the difficulty setting on one and played it like a cartoony first-person shooter. Just blasting through Nazi’s. It wound up being fun enough.The biggest disappointment about this game is the fact that it was so close to being great. With it being on the Doom engine, I thought it was going to play like that. Unfortunately, it didn’t happen quite like that. The story is better than Doom but Doom has the better gameplay.The entire game was not very long, which is a pro and a con. The game is not something you want to do for 15 hours. But at the same time, asking people to spend $60 on an eight-hour game is asking a lot.

Along the way you build stat upgrades which you can use during your dungeon crawlingThe story, dialogue, voices and character interactions are very good, making it an addictive game where you want to level up and progress to further the story. The story also involve real world topics that deals with mature themes such as abuse, crime, rape, blackmail-GraphicsVery stylish with its anime art design/cutscenes, jagged comic book speech bubbles, very colorful backdrops and varied characters personalities . Even the UI has a stylistic flare to it. All transitional screens and menus are well animated. Very nice presentation overall as it looks very slick, edgy and modern.-Gameplay:In the metaverse, you sneak through palaces and stealth hit/ambush wandering enemies for a leg up in battleOnce battle is initiated it's your typical jrpg turn based system but with a twistIf you hit an enemy with move that's super effective against them, you'll get an extra turn to attack until your combo gets large enough where you get an optional all-out-attackAn enemy can sometimes do an 'Hold Up!' prompt where you can spare their life for money, item or have them join you as a Persona summon.For the latter you get a multiple choice question answer segment where you have to convince them to join you with a successful choice dependent on the enemies personality. You can then fuse personas and make stronger onesOnce a palace is conquered you are not able to return, but you can get mementos or side quests from random NPCs to further level up if you want toIn the real world there's a lot of micro time management. You may be overwhelmed with activities that you cannot do all in a single day and some activities are only open on particular days . Thus you have to pick and choose what to do to build up your stats (like eating burgers, reading on the train station, studying, watching movies, etc) or build relationships with a friend. For the latter, building relationship further increase their persona in battle and similar persona types that you capture/make join your teamAll activities level up 1 of 5 stats: Knowledge, Charm, Guts, Kindness, or Proficiency. These stats once leveled up open new activities and opportunities to level up in the meta-verse and improve social links furthering the story.They're a lot of interlocking game mechanics in play that the tutorial may last you a couple of hours depending on how familiar you are with the series. Even though the game handholds you for a couple of hours, it's very natural and you don't feel lectured most of the time. After those few hours, you get invested very easily as the world opens up to you, and you can easily sink in 100+ hours into this game.Overall best Persona Game I've ever played and for those who like a narrative driven story where a lot of your own choices predicts an outcome, this game is a must buy.",Joker340

Man hatBioWare versucht sich an einem Spagat zwischen den eigenen erzählerischen Tugenden und einer offenen Welt à la The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim – und die faulen Kompromisse dazwischen sind sehr schmerzhaft. Anstatt die traditionellen Stärken auszubauen, hat man sich an der erfolgreichen Konkurrenz von Bethesda orientiert und vieles von Skyrim kopiert, ohne dessen Sogwirkung zu erreichen. Man hat sich vom situativen Rollenspiel mit dramatischem Drehbuch entfernt, um einen riesigen Spielplatz zu eröffnen. Der sieht wunderbar aus, lockt mit Weite und Vielfalt. Aber der Kern ist entweder gewöhnlich, anspruchslos oder so schrecklich statisch wie in manchem Online-Rollenspiel. Da ist weder erzählerisch noch spielerisch diese Faszination spürbar, die man nach Baldur’s Gate noch auf Dragon Age: Origins übertragen konnte. Sollte es in den letzten zwanzig Jahren Fortschritte hinsichtlich des Figurenverhaltens gegeben haben, wird man sie hier nicht finden. Die wenigen wirklich guten Quests gehen im überstrapazierten Holen und Bringen unter. Aufgrund der Widersprüche zwischen dem Erzählten und dem Erlebten entsteht zudem sehr früh eine Distanz zur Spielwelt und ihren Akteuren. Warum soll ich als Herold der Inquisition Eisen sammeln oder Widder jagen? Der eigene Held? Moralisch kaum formbar! Es gibt nur wenig dramatische Momente, in denen das alte BioWare aufblitzt, denn Drehbuch und Story gehen während der Schnitzeljagd immer wieder unter. Ja, man kann man sich für 30 bis 80 Stunden in einem schier endlosen Freischalt- und Vervollständigungsfluss treiben lassen: Es gibt so viel zu bekämpfen, zu befreien, zu pflücken, zu basteln und auch zu entscheiden – nur dass sich dabei wenig auf die Geschichte auswirkt. Die potenziellen Erkundungsreize der schönen Landschaften werden früh von der Spoilerkarte erstickt und vieles wird schrecklich offensichtlich für Sammler verteilt - das Auffinden von Geheimnissen per Richtungsimpuls ist das Dämlichste, was die Kanadier bisher entwickelt haben. Das Kampfsystem schließlich ist nichts Halbes für Actionfreunde und nichts Ganzes für Pausetaktiker, aber bietet immerhin Komboreize in fulminanten Gefechten. Man wird letztlich in eine vollgestopfte Fantasywelt entführt, die einen für Wochen mit all ihrem Klimbim zum Surfen an der Oberfläche animiert. Da noch eine Scherbe, hier noch eine Sehenswürdigkeit und vielleicht noch einen Riss schließen. Die wirklich guten Rollenspiele sind wie Tauchgänge. Aber BioWare will diese Tiefe gar nicht mehr erforschen - da schwimmt zu wenig Zielgruppe.",34801

Because Skyrim lets you play just like you want; how can one have a bad gaming experience in such a game? In fact the most annoying flaws the game have, in my opinion, are: the mouse movements and selections in the menus and some graphical glitches I read reviews where people say that graphics are bad. I don't know, i liked super mario but i'm not asking Skyrim to be 8-bits. I find the graphics to be good; could have they been better? Yes. Does this ruin my gaming experience? Not at all. The fighting system is dynamic and entertaining; finishing moves are usually cool, although, honestly, sometimes may be disturbing. Melee fighting is satisfying and pretty realistic; magic has been reworked since Oblivion and now it is much more easy to be used and entertaining, not to mention, useful. The storyline is acceptable, even if i still prefer the Morrowind one; the ""guild"" ones are possibly better then the main one: it is easy to actually feel part of the Companions or the Thieves Guild of Riften! One of the best features in the game, in my opinion, is the non-fixed class system. You're not asked to choose a class to play, but you're free to use whichever skill you prefer. The perk system could be better, but all in all it is good and flexible. I feel Skyrim not to have a well designed difficulty curve, since some lvl40 fights are way more easy then some lvl6 ones. This mainly is due to some fixed monster levels, that on the other hand make the game more realistic (will you be able to fight a giant when you hardly know how to wield a sword?). The world lives: npcs have a life, enemies will respawn (let's say, repopulating some locations), radiant quests can always be found. In the end, Skyrim lets you have a wonderful experience, only hardly ruined (if you really like the rpg gaming style) by some menu/graphic glitches. If you have enjoyed the previous Elder Scrolls games and you still don't have Skyrim, don't wait any more seconds and buy the game.

I just ignore it every year, after year, after year of the same generic crap.I would say this is probably the funniest game so far, not from the dialog or anythingNow, I wouldn't go so far as to say this is the WORST game in the series, but I would easily say it is the most boring next to the last 3. I was never really a gigantic fan of the series, but it is like Call of Duty to me. I just ignore it every year, after year, after year of the same generic crap.I would say this is probably the funniest game so far, not from the dialog or anything even close to that, much more from the hilarious things that the AI does. From traders yelling with no audio at all to the civilians that just mumble down the street.The combat is very forgettable, and not exciting at all ever. I never once felt a moment of panic while doing it, if anything I felt it was probably the weakest point of the game.The ship combat is way, WAY overhyped. It is practically identical to that of Assasin's Creed 3 (Which was also very boring).The dialog is easily forgettable and isn't even accurate to the time period, the characters are the same, and the environment's would probably be the best part of the game to me. I won't deny that in SOME parts, the environments look pretty impressive and beautiful at times. Though not always.Ship customization is actually pretty cool to be honest, though it hardly brings the game above a mediocre score.All in all, if for whatever reason you are a huge Assassin's Creed fan, by all means you should get this game. But otherwise I can't see what audience it could claim, it is confusing, and extremely boring. This is probably the most dull game I have trudged through since Call of Duty Ghosts, but at least that was a short pain. This lasts hours and hours, just like every one of these.If I could choose between beating this game 5 times (Which I did with Gta 5, which I personally think is one of, if not the best games ever made) or being punched in the face by Mike Tyson, I'd take some Advil and choose Tyson.",AWSOME-O

Well I'm 9 hours in have only two familiars and am thoroughly enjoying this impressive JRPG. I'm still currently having my hand held through gameplay with new spells, responsibilities and tools being unlocked as I go which really contributes to the depth on offer here. Ni No Kuni IS an important JRPG because it demonstrates to the Japanese what western players love about the genre and this is being shown in sales and acclaim (though some western critics still stubbornly dismiss the gameplay and combat as dull). Personally I have always loved turn-based combat, and whilst the FF series lost this when square soft merged to become square-enix through awful ATB, Level-5 bring it back via Pokemon and form something that's fast, fluid and not a chore. Battles come and go so quickly that there's no tsk when an enemy forces you to engage. What's even better is the fact that if you grind for a while enemy encounters will generally lessen because the enemies no longer attack and instead will attempt to flee from a confrontation. This is a much welcomed move which really refines the combat and any qualms modern gamers may have with it. In terms of story, Ghibli has not been watered down that much, providing a fantastic coming-of-age tale that comes off as touching and mature. The cutesy animation may put players off, but for those who have always enjoyed Ghibli's output (myself included) there is really no excuse not to pick this up. The characters of Oliver and Mr Drippy are fresh, vivid and more importantly relatable, and the dialogue exchanges are humorous as well as informative if you're getting overwhelmed with the gameplay information. You're even provided with a pokedex type journal which allows you to view all the creatures you'll come across in the game, which includes video animations and information which can aid you in defeating them. Couple this with side quests aplenty, a beautiful world map to explore, towns with talkative inhabitants and some the gorgeous animated cutscenes and you have the recipe for the finest JRPG since Disgaea (just my opinion).",CalR

No es necesario que os compréis la Switch por este juego, no merece, ni de lejos, en mi opinión, lo que cuesta. Os cuento que yo he jugado a la versión Wii U durante 5 horas, y podéis decir que es poco tiempo para hacer una crítica, pero la verdad es que es el tiempo que he tardado en hartarme del juego. Aparte del apartado gráfico (bonito pero básico) y los fallos, hay cuatro cosas que no soporté del juego:1. la primera su dificultad; a mi me gusta ponerme los juegos en difícil o muy difícil y este juego me pareció super sencillo. La única vez que morí fue por agotamiento en una charca y que me quedaba poca vida por saltar de sitios altos, etc. Eso de poder pausar el juego y comerse cualquier cosa para subir vida, es un modo dios en toda regla, mientras tengas comida, no te matarán los enemigos. Solo hice dos mazmorras y los ""puzles"" que había en ella, si se pueden llamar puzles a eso que era más fácil que pegarle a una piedra con un palo, puede que se pongan más díficiles al final, pero viendo las del principio, no tengo esperanzas de que los puzles supongan un reto de habilidad real.2. La segunda, su mundo está vacío!!!! Solo hay hierbas, unas cuantas ruinas desperdigadas y nada más. Vi a un Jabalí al inicio del juego y tras 5 horas no he visto nada más, ni un misero pájaro ni nada, ¿de donde sacan los Bokoblin la carne? De animales no por que no hay, solo hay Bokoblin, ruinas y hojas. El mundo de Hyrule está muerto, no tiene vida, y desconozco si tenía clima (lluvia, tormentas, etc.) pero me da que el clima lo indicaba la zona y era siempre el mismo. Me daba siempre la sensación de sitio vacío.3. Las armas y su sistema de rotura. Esto ya puede ser variante de una persona a otra. El sistema de armas y que se te rompan siempre hagas lo que hagas (pensé que se podían reparar pero no) a mi no me ha gustado, ya que implica dos cosas, primero que yo no puedo usar siempre el arma que me guste porque se me romperá, y segundo es que es seguro que tendrás que ir recolectando armas como si fueran meros objetos de usar y tirar, por lo que estoy convencido de que conseguir armas en este juego no es difícil, seguramente llegas a un sitio nuevo y te las encuentras en cualquier lado sin esfuerzo. Tampoco me gusto el sistema de la tableta esa que te dan al principio, que es una llave para abrir cosas.... vamos a ver si te dan la llave para entrar a todas las cosas al principio del juego obligado... ¿para que demonios la cierran? Que las dejen abiertas y que no necesite ese pase raro, o que se necesite de habilidades especiales para entrar en las dungeon como en otros zeldas.4. El Hype y la critica del juego. Espera un juegazo que me hiciera ver las estrellas y que dijera que bomba de juego, ojo el juego no es malo, pero esperaba muchísimo más, no un Sandbox de apartado técnico cutrillo, con una historia que ni fu ni fa, con un mundo sin vida y con un sistema tan fácil de mientras recolectes y lleves toda la mochila llena de comida y armas (que las encuentras sin esfuerzos y a patadas por el mundo) eres Dios y no morirás, aderezado por unas dungeon y puzles que hasta para niños sería fácil.Para dejarlo claro, estaba jugando al Ocarina of Time y al Windwaker y los deje parados para ponerme con este... Prefiero los otros dos sin dudas, al igual que también prefiero en Skyward Sword. Me falta jugar al Majora Mask y al Between Worlds. Eso si no es el peor de la franquicia, mi lista sería:1 - Ocarina of Time2- Skyward Sword3- Wind Waker4- Breath of Wild5- Spirit Track(?)Majora Mask(?) Between WorldsAbstract:A Sandbox of Zelda is very easy. The world is dead, no animals, no clima, all is empty. Tecnichally poor but beatiful (but poor). With food and weapons (you can find easily in any place on Hyrule) you are God mode, and you cant die. Very easy game. The Story... regular.Good game, yeah, good, no perfect or the best in the world.... o no, only good.

You have been warned.The story continues about 6-8 months after the last DLC of Mass Effect 2 ""Arrival"" when the reapers invade Earth, as well as other planets throughout the galaxy. You escape the initial events in order to try and rally the other races of the galaxy to mobilize a massive counterattack to take back Earth, and ultimately the galaxy as a whole. Along the way you meet up with familiar faces from the first two games. Some only last little while, others will stick with you until the end, and you have the option to continue your romance with whomever you were going after (assuming they survived the first and/or second game). To me the character connections and development  was the best in the series, and to my memory the best in any video game series to date. From having a friendly shooting competition with Garrus to Tali getting drunk using an ""Emergency induction port"" It just serves to bring a closeness with companion characters that no game has ever done before. It's not just sunshine, rainbows, and puppies though. Numerous characters end up making sacrifices so that you can succeed at your mission, which ultimately leads to my low review score but more on that later.Game play wise this game plays really similar to Mass Effect 2, combat is a bit more challenging and smooth. Weapons are now allow for much more customization through the use of extended barrels for damage increases, scopes for better accuracy, and ammo that allows to shoot people through cover, albeit with reduced damage. The cover system has also been improved quite a bit and plays more like Gears of War, though not quite as responsive while moving in cover, but it's still an improvement over ME2.   Combat wise you see a decent variety with enemies, and in some cases it's better to target a specific enemy first as they can ""buff"" other enemies with armor, shields ect, but as mentioned earlier it's near identical to ME2. One last thing is that you now have a weight system that determines how often you can use your powers. For soldiers it's not as big of a deal since you have all 5 weapon slots used, and with the use of Ammo powers (ammo powers don't have cooldowns and weight does not effect them) it's not as big of a deal. For Classes with numerous Biotic/Tech powers It's more of a concern since you rely on weapon damage much less than the soldier, so it makes you think about what weapons (and how many) you want to load up with. The only notable thing missing are boss battles. Yes you do have certain enemies that you have to burn through multiple layers of defenses, but there is nothing like there was with Saren at the end of ME1 or the human reaper at the end of ME2. Now as many people across many sites have been saying the first 99% of the game is fantastic, it's the last 1%, or 10 minutes that completely ruin the game, and for some people the series. Without getting into specific spoilers it boils down to two main gripes I have with the ending. 1) Is that the plot device used to end the game came out of left field, there was no foreshadowing, evidence or anything else to prepare us for the emergence of this ""Deus Ex Machina""   and 2) The player loses any semblance of control or choice that they have had throughout the entire series, when it matters the most. The player is simply given options, that quite frankly feel disjointed from the overarching themes of the Mass Effect universe, and you have no way to argue or protest, it simply ""is what it is."" Add on top of that the ""different  choices"" lead to what is ultimately a near identical result since you see ABSOLUTELY NO consequences of your decision. Heck you don't even know if most of your companions live or die! Ultimately all the choices and relationships you made, all the sacrifices you, your companions, and even the galaxy at large made end up seeming meaningless were unworthy of the ending they received.

There are a couple of chievs that you won't know whether you get them or not until the end game.  If you somehow mess up along the way you'll never know.  I had this for one of the chievs and even though I watched carefully and restarted when I wasn't sure I still didn't get one of them.  What dev sat there in the design meetings and said ""this is an awesome idea""?  They need to be fired.  Additionally several of the chievs contract each other so you end up playing sections of the game over again just to unlock them all.  This is most obvious if you're trying for the stealth chievs.  You'll have to replay several sections twice and you won't know until you've finished the game whether you'll even get them all.  This is the devs way of saying ""screw you"".  This game is at the top of my ""worst chievs ever list"".  The purpose of chievs is to reward you for doing something you wouldn't normally do.  Not for forcing you to play the entire game a certain way and leave you guessing until the end.  The chievs devs need to go back to chievs 101 before they are allowed to design them in the future.

216264,Hyper Light Drifter,PC,10,"Hyper Light Drifter is a true gem. It was a long time coming, (waiting for this game), but the years of anticipation have been beyond worth it!

It was a long time coming, (waiting for this game), but the years of anticipation have been beyond worth it! Here is my review, as succinct as it can be.HLD throws you, the drifter, head first into a vibrant, mysterious world. You wake up from some slumber to find a post-apocalyptic land flooded with gorgeous, neon-painted landscapes and scenery, made possible by some freaking fantastic pixel artistry. You begin to wander the land, still totally unaware of who you are or why you're here, until you stumble upon the contrasting elements to this world's eye-grabbing visuals. A vile, destructive disease has poisoned your heart, and innocent land dwellers have been slaughtered by dreadful barbaric wars. If that weren't enough, some dark, sinister force seems intent on either killing you, maliciously toying with your soul, or both.And so begins your journey. From here, you'll talk to villagers through pictographs (no words are ever spoken) and hear their tragic accounts. You'll stop by the local upgrade shops with their neat cryptic language to get a sneak peek at your later, stronger self. When you head out in one of four cardinal directions, you'll begin to master your sword, your pistol, and - of course - your dash/drift. You'll encounter numerous enemies of varying size, race, and attacks, and with every death, you'll understand how to outsmart them on the next life.This game is intriguing, and so terribly satisfying. Finding secrets, beating bosses, buying upgrades, you feel awesome. The combat is challenging, but incredibly rewarding. When you clear out a large room and just barely survive, there's a sense of accomplishment that says: ""You earned this."" And to top it all off, through the entire experience, a gorgeous soundtrack by one of gaming's best (Disasterpiece) immerses you in this universe of light, death, and hope.I cannot recommend this game enough. Major props to Heart Machine, you guys are brilliant.",ThePian0Man

38787,BioShock Infinite,PC,0,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Pros:- Decent lighting effects (overshadowed by low res textures)- Solid sound design and effects. Music in the game helps support the plot at points in creative ways.- Excellent, believable, voice acting. This is the strongest point of the game IMO.Cons:-  Completely on rails experience. You have this amazing city in the sky, but you can't explore it. You can't use the sky rail to move from one side of the city to the other. There is no sense of exploration. Columbia is reduced to a bunch of kill hallways.-    No sense of atmosphere. You never forgot for a second that you were at the bottom of the ocean in Bioshock's Rapture. You'd hear creaking noises from the water pressure, and see leaking water from the outside coming in, etc. However, Columbia is not this way. You forget that you are floating in the sky unless you actively stop what you are doing to look at a building move slightly. This is the opposite of immersion.-    Bland, generic, boring, useless weapons. I used 2 weapons in this game (volley gun and pistol) for 95% of the game. Except for occasionally using the sniper and RPG, you don't need to use any other weapons. They are there as an artificial display of 'weapon diversity'. Even the guns I did use were boring even when fully upgraded.-  The vigors are completely unoriginal and boring. I did not need to switch between vigors as much as I should of.-  Atrocious enemy AI. They scream and run at you with a billy club while you have an RPG. They seem to take cover and uncover at scripted times.-  Key plot details are left in purposely out-of-your-way places (the Voxophones). If you don't stop everything you are doing and listen to them, then you won't understand the story and ending. This is horrible and lazy storytelling. The audio logs in Bioshock 1 complemented the story, they were not essential to it.- The story is incredibly convoluted and poorly written, and a lot of complex details are rushed in and thrown at you during the last 20 minutes, so you are sure not to understand. Terrible pacing. Complexity is not a substitute for quality.-  The game is about 8 hours long. This is just downright insulting. Spend $60 to play an 8 hour game? A horrible, boring, poorly written, game no less?-  False Advertising: This was a completely different game than what was shown in the E3 demos. I understand developers sometimes have to cut things out here and there for time reasons. But this was full-on Aliens:Colonial Marines-like false advertising. Watered down visuals (no dynamic lighting), watered down physics (small objects in the world don't get picked up by Bucking Bronco like they did in the demo), watered down animations, watered down enemy AI, and watered down textures. Even the sky-rail is better implemented than the final product. I don't care if it was 'because of consoles' or not. No reason is justified for lying to us. I have no idea why Irrational is not getting sued like Gearbox did.This is the entire game: You go to an area, shoot some enemies, loot, talk to Liz or have a cutscene, then rinse and repeat. Game of the year? Are you joking?If you liked the first two Bioshocks in any way, do not buy this game. It is an insult to the Shock series of games.There was not one second of this game where I could say it was ""game of the year"" and ""completely groundbreaking"" and ""setting a new standard for video games"" or any of the other hyperbole tossed around from gaming publications.",Beast_Pot_Pie

Tiene poca rejugabilidad pero puede llevar unas 15 horas terminar la historia y entre 25 y 30 horas en terminarlo junto a las misiones secundarias.

The gameplay is great and the overall quality of the game is top-notch but there are a few things about the game I find disapointing.  First of all the skill tree does not allow for a great deal of customization and when leveling up we don't even get to choose which skill we want to unlock, it's already determined.  Also we no longer get to spend attribute points, they increase automatically as we level up.  Personally if there is one mechanic I like about RPGs is deciding where I spend my points. The story is not really engaging and the campaign is quite short, I know that this game is designed to be played more than once to unlock every skills and runes but I think the campaign could have been a little longer for those of us who enjoy storytelling.  I am not going to comment about connection issues as this is something that Blizzard will fix soon no doubt.Another thing that is a little strange to me is the damage system, the base damage of a weapon will increase your overall damage.  I can understand this makes sense for the barbarian but for a wizard it seems bizarre to run around with a mace and a shield to increase spell damage and protection.  In most RPGs caster are inefficient with melee weapons and shields and it makes sense like that.This is still a very good game... but not awesome.  Blizzard could have innovated a little bit more... it's not like they didn't have time!  I really wish they would start taking more risks when developing a game, they have to get out of their comfort zone.

But I can tell you that this game has been huge fun for me for the past 3 days, and thats only start :). It seems that people in arenanet have done their research, looked for everything that players of MMO's didnt like, and found a way around that. Materials clogging your backpack? you can put them in a bank from anywhere in the world. Production made easy cause you can access the bank directly from that window. If an area is full of players, and the game would be laggy otherwise, you will be thrown into overflow (copy of that area) to wait your queue. Everything you do in overflow counts just as it would if youre on a main zone. I understand that some people find this a minus, but to me it's realistic solution to computer and networking limits we have today. World vs Word is everything I hoped Warhammer online would be (warhammer looks like a todlers game in comparison). Before I thought that 10 keys in total would be somewhat on a minus side, but trust me, combinations are endless and fun, and you will use that 10 keys, not like wow where you have ton of abilities of which you use what? 3 keys for pve and additional 2 for pvp?Graphic is nothing groundbraking, but looks very very nice.

You can choose through a variety of large upgrades such as weapons and armor on the Batmobile. Speaking of the batmobile, aka the most controversial thing about the game. It is very well done in a way that lets you drive around and have lots of fun with it. But they should have stopped there. They keep forcing you into batmobile puzzles and just waves of the same drones over and over witch do get very frustrating and very annoying throughout the game. The plot is very good in my opinion. In the near beginning that is basically just amazing. I won't spoil obviously but prepare to be surprised. Yes the Arkham Knight's Identity is very obvious to any comic book fan or just basically someone with knowledge of the Batman Universe.

It's full of impressive set pieces with buildings falling down around the player's linear path, but these superficial big budget set pieces barely hide to anyone with experience with MW or MW2 that so much content from them is recycled with just a few minor edits made to the textures to fool the player into thinking what they're seeing is new (case in point: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5dsOn06w1s - an entire building from CoD4), this goes for character models, animations, weapons, vehicles, gameplay sequences (for example the boat secion in MW2), a huge amount of content is reused and the game seems to be built around what they could recycle more than what they could create from scratch. The lack of originality or even intention to be original is present throughout the entire game. The story itself is actually quite enjoyable and feels as much a sequel to CoD4 and MW2, making it tie together nicely as a trilogy, though some sections make it feel more like a fanfic than a true sequel (considering that most of the people who worked on MW2 left and had nothing to do with MW3), the last mission was more of a QTE filled joke than a satisfying conclusion. I wonder how different it would've turned out had 40 of the key staff from IW, the original and only true CoD developer, due to Activision's disgusting treatment of the series, the staff and their creation. I won't even go to the clunkily added controversial scene involving the death of a random child that felt tacked on or the fact that everyone the player kills in the campaign is either African or Russian.Spec Ops is a mixed bag, the missions are a mix of fun and terrible, and the Veteran difficulty is like that of the campaign, a very lazily added hard difficulty where the player dies to psychic enemies in around 3 bullets, usually within a second of peeking out from cover (and by peeking I mean moving, as there is still no lean function). The survival mode however is a lot of fun, it works well as two player co-op and a lot of the tedium from the other survival mode in the series, Zombies, is removed by taking out the luck factor with the amount of ammo the player can get and which weapons they acquire. There's a lot of fun to be had here with a friend and it runs smoothly online, the same can't be said for the multiplayer though.In the previous Call of Duty, Black Ops, quickscoping was removed on the basis it's a cheap exploit of the game's aim assist, and that was a good call, though it annoyed many kids who like to do it in MW2. They brought this back in MW3 to please those kids and without regard for the quality of their game's online, this sums up their approach to the multiplayer. As a reskin of MW2 it of course plays quite similarly, they've made attempts to better balance the game with how effective the knife, grenade launchers and killstreak rewards are (which amongst quickscoping ranked as the biggest complaints of MW2's multiplayer) and the new point streak system is a nice addition, but all of the technical problems with this peer hosted, laggy mess with poor hit detection and terrible matchmaking still remain, taking a lot of the fun out of playing it, along of course with the huge focus on player's stats (made worse by in-depth stat tracking) that has most players approaching the game in as cheap a way as possible to camp themselves to a high kill/death ratio. The new game modes aren't actually to original either, some of them may as well credit other older and more recent games considering they're so close to them in design. The map design itself is a campfest, designed by Raven Software as after the majority of IW including all its creative and technical talent it took the few left at IW and other Activision developer Slegehammer Games to design the bulk of the game and they needed help fitting map design into their tight schedule, as of course a Call of Duty has to be out every single Novemeber in order to monopolise on the Christmas sales.Lazily made rehash that might as well urinate on the grave of the original Infinity Ward, Activision's approach to this franchise is a good representation of everything that's wrong with the game industry right now.JM",thisismyopinion

263722,Alien: Isolation,PC,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        When I started Alien: Isolation, I noticed the painstaking detail of the Torrens spacecraft which truly does look like it comes straight out of Ridley Scott's Alien. The voice acting was good, the sounds are amazing and stay true to the film, and the graphics and visuals are absolutely stunning. The second the Torrens spacecraft arrives to Sevastopol Station (where you will spend most of the game in), something doesn't seem right. The ship looks damaged and there is someone trying to contact you for help. You then find yourself on the station alone, and then you start to get scared. I thought the Alien was going to kill me the second I stepped in the ship. And this is where we get to the A.I. that the Alien has. The A.I. of the Alien is very good although it may sometimes bug out but most of the time you cannot predict which way the Alien will go and that is what makes the Alien truly terrifying. But the Alien is not the only threat on the ship. The other threats are people and synthetic androids called ""Working Joes."" As soon as I saw these things chills ran down my spine because I remember how Ash relentlessly attacked Ellen Ripley in the 1979 Alien. And when they do attack they are a chore to kill. It takes several headshots with a gun to kill one of them and many, many hits with a crowbar to kill. But when you get more advanced weapons like the bolt gun, they are easier to kill. But if they outnumber you, you are screwed. The bad thing about this game is that the Alien gets ""killed"" by Amanda Ripley about halfway through the game and the other half is fighting working joes which was a bit dissapointing to me. But, Alien Isolation is a great Alien game that we've all been waiting for.",demolisher7778

Let's start off with the good, nice open world with zombies and combat is fun albeit repetitive.  The bad, the game has numerous bugs, awful character development, boring quests, awful leveling structure and a checkpoint system.  Lets start with the bugs, which are still pretty bad even after half a year of release.  The game has issues with sound, such as loud crackling and popping noises every once in a while.  It progressively gets worse and worse until you reach the sewers where I had to throw my headphones off the audio was so loud.  After that it sort of tapers off, but the sewers are a good ~10 hours in the game.  The game's character development, as an RPG you'd think they'd invest some time into explaining characters.  Nah, you're just there and the only information is the bio at the beginning, they introduce characters but they're cliche and you can't wait until they die.  The quests are stupid and repetitive, Dead Island has two types of quests and doesn't even try to hide it.  Fetch and escort, that's it.  You may have one or two go here, fetch item and protect guy, but that's as interesting as the quests get.  One of the problem with quests is there's no reason to do them.  The enemies follow a strict level scaling and you never get the feeling that you've ever leveled up.  Often times games introduce new abilities to offset this mechanic so it appears you get stronger compared to your opponent but you actually don't, Dead Island does none of this.  Once I realized this towards the end of Act 2, I just stockpiled on decent weapons and avoided enemies and quests because I knew the faster I leveled the more obsolete my weapons would become.  The checkpoint system is awful because of two reasons, it means I can't leave the game whenever I want; but the real problem with the checkpoint system is it's bugged.  The checkpoint system leaves you in unexplained places upon your return.  It happens from my count at least a third of my checkpoints left me in weird areas, two of the most noticeable were in Act 2 I left the game, when I returned the game placed my in the Jungle, which is Act 3.  So I drove around for an hour trying to figure how to leave and finally just reloaded my last checkpoint which put me back in Act 2.  Another checkpoint problem was I left the game and the quest had be going to some control panel to unlock doors, guess what the checkpoint did?  It put me right in front of the control panels with the doors unlocked.  There's plenty of WTF moments in Dead Island, and while I was able to beat the game by 50% of the main plot progress it was beating me down.  The game's shortcomings all slowly start to beat you down until you no longer want to play.  You'll spend more time screaming at the screen because of bug's than the actually difficulty.  Game took ~16 hours for me to beat but towards 50% I was just rushing through everything just for the sake of completion and not fun.",MrSniker

You do feel for Kratos and his son;- realms are nice and exploring every one of them is huge delight.Things which are ok, but far from perfect:- crafting system is basic and not very handy;- foes are designed in economy mode, like having just one finishing animation per enemy - looks unexpected for a project with such impressive production;- generally game brings no new ideas, you just have decent compilation of existing ones, some are polished, some are not. Simply speaking, it is nice ripe apple, but not the apple tree which will push the genre and inspire new projects/approaches.Things which disappointed me:- low number of villain types, killing the same kind of troll 10 times is a joke;- difficulty level does not influence villains behavior, which is a pity. Health and numbers boost is the only difference;- combat is VERY repetitive and tiring;- puzzles are... well... they are there but unimpressive and not very evident sometimes.So I think the best way to enjoy the game is to set easy/normal difficulty level and run through the story.

I called the twist ending about a little over halfway through the game.In short: Linear. Fun. Beautiful. Not as great as I thought and people said, but still good enough to play.The original Bioshock was a plot that I never could have predicted and was so shocking and mind-blowing that I instantly loved the game even more than I already had up to that point.This latest installment? I called the twist ending about a little over halfway through the game. While I didn't predict everything that happened in the end, the major twists were obvious to me already and it was admittedly satisfying to be right about it. But perhaps that's because after playing and enjoying Bioshock 1 & 2, I know how the writers think already.It is a linear story and really there's two moments in the game where you're actually forced to choose one option or another, and they are light decisions too. You can bypass certain side areas and continue on the main storyline full speed so I guess there's an element of player choice in that, but obviously that's not recommended. (unless you're doing a speed run)Anyway, I played the game on Hard difficulty and it was pretty challenging at certain parts  those Handymen are tough bastards! I had to be revived a lot on most of the boss scenes.  For most of it though it wasn't too bad, even on Hard difficulty. Combat was fun, hectic, and exciting.Vigors  which are Columbia's version of plasmids  are interesting and combos were pretty fun, although I didn't much understand the last one that you get (Return to Sender) and I had to actually look it up. I barely used that one. HahaCharacter development is pretty good, and particularly with Elizabeth. They did a wonderful job of making her act more life-like. If you pause in certain areas long enough she goes around on her own and looks at stuff, pointing out things that you might have missed. She also interacts with the environment on her own if you give her some time to. For instance, sitting down on benches, leaning against walls, and particularly the beach scene is where you see the most of this free-form acting. The expressions she gives and her body language also reflect her mood, which of course is affected by the situation. Voice acting is of course superb for all characters.Graphically, the game is good, but not as great as it could have and arguably should have been. Textures in particular could have been so much better. But the lighting and particles are well done. the atmosphere they've created is definitely fantastic and, coupled with the music and the actual gameplay, this installment of Bioshock is memorable.Anyway, I do like it and would recommend this to people. It is a lot of fun to explore a whole different world from Rapture. The floating buildings and open spaces, the sky, the clouds, the sunlight, the society... it was a glorious sight to see and to be in the floating city of Columbia.",Toffenuff

Death is an assertive badass that knows what he wants and goes for it. In fact, all characters combined with the game's epic narration, occasional hand drawn comics, and voice acting were incredible and spot on. Not to mention the different realms you traverse on your ultimate quest and the matching atmospheric music that comes with them. I enjoyed the design with much delight.Fight system is somewhat standard for this genre. Fast pace, no aiming required, just precise timing and dodging and knowledge of few combos. Sometimes adjusting camera during the fight (which took some time to get used to, but nothing crucial to worry about). I only felt like once I settled to my optimal combos and attack moves I used them everywhere with unmatched opposition and it got a bit repetitive. The biggest boss fights usually brought new fight patterns, but apart from that were still the same. Skill system and weapons (including the secrets/boss loot) offered only a little variety in them with little feeling of reward.Though I still strongly recommend this game, just because the design part was extremely well done.

Yes, the graphics are dated - but you would never know it on the 360, battlefield actually looks much worse than MW3 on consoles (btw, I love BF3 too! :D ).  Yes, this is the 'madden' of FPS's.  But, let me give an example for my arguement: Counter-Strike is still one of the biggest FPS's in the world - after being out for over ten years and never changing the formula.  People like the way it feels and they wouldn't want it to change very much, if at all.  Modern Warfare is the console version of that formula.  It works, not because people are 'mindless drones', but because they love the gameplay and want a fresh look on the formula.  New maps, graphical tweaks, and great gameplay could keep this game going for years.I could understand that some people are tired of call of duty, that's fine.  I never really got into the other games too much - just played them on and off - but I'm having a blast with this game.  Gameplay wise, this is by far the best 'feeling' game of the series, the controls just feel right.  As for the maps, they are the best ones yet.  If you are the type that likes to lay low in a building somewhere in a corner and camp... you might hate these maps.  The maps are small and made for fast action.  They all have a  great 'flow' to them, many different routes to take, and many ways to either put yourself in good position to flank enemies or get out of a bad situation.  There's also tons of cover, there's debris/objects everywhere, so there's many different ways to 'play' the areas of a map.All in all, an amazing iteration of COD, the best one yet.  As you can see from the other reviews on this website, the hatred toward the call of duty franchise is unmatched - as of this writing, there are 863 'negative' reviews with only 215 'positive'...  But, there are nearly two million people, just on Xbox Live, playing MW3 online at this very moment.â",origin879

The story is an absolute travesty. The cut scenes are basically there so you can go get a beer before the next mission. If there's a war going on I'd like to know just what the heck we're doing to win it. It sure doesn't seem like a war is going on. The units all feel like toys or cartoons, everything feels borderline racist, and you think that might come out really well at first, but it ends up being dopey. They ""blended naval combat seamlessly into the game"" by making it hardly distinguishable from land combat. It feels like everyone's got little rafts. The maps are claustrophobic, water does not act as any sort of distinguishable barrier, its not clear what units can move across water and which can't, the unit abilities are unfocused and take two brains and three hands for a human player to use, and the Russian commando unit is a girl. And, no, its not cool to command an army of trained bears. They die really really fast and you lose. The blimps are tiny, the resource gathering mechanic feels mindless and tacked on,everything about the aircraft is annoying and worst of all the companion AI's are just an awful addition. They take up your resources and fight your battles for you. That may sound okay, but trust me, you don't know how much you enjoyed being in control of your own forces until half of them are at the AIs disposal. You don't decide when and where to crush the enemy, he does. The best thing you companion can possibly do is die. The happiest thing that ever happened to me in a mission was seeing my companion die and taking over his resources.I cannot tell you how much I loved Red Alert 2. It was my first RTS. I played every C&C game after that. Even the really old kinda crappy ones. After Tiberium Wars, I was optimistic. I thought maybe EA would not take a crap all over the C&C franchise, I thought things might work out. I was WRONG. I honestly can't think of anything good to say about this game.

So you do some racing, tank battles (you destroy like 50-100 enemy tanks in one battle). It's like they got hammer and see nails everywhere. Batmobil is overused, repetitive and even annoying after a while (like 3 repeated activities with more and more enemies to destroy - plain and stupid).3. Combat. To be honest, it's just like before. They got hammer so they see nails everywhere. Batman ALWAYS was all about stealth. Arkham Asylum was perfect in this. Arkham City was OK. Arkham Knight is just plain TERRIBLE. They introduced few more ways to dispatch your enemies. Environment ""stuns"", chain attacks (where you can put down 3-5 enemies without chance for them to fight back), tag team etc. And you end up fighting tons of enemies over and over again. Only few sections allow you to play stealth. BUT combat is fun.4. Story. Story is OK. It's not great but have it's moment. Too bad is too obvious. And whole idea about Arkham Knight... well I won't give you spoilers but it's NOT new character. Rocksteady played it safe :-/. I like idea with second ending after you reach 100% completion. On the other hand - 240 Riddlers trophies? REALLY? I understand 50-100 but 240? Just finish side missions that have sense and then watch second ending on Youtube.5. Bugs.

No frame drops (even during car changes where you destroy everything, move very fast etc. No crashes (and I finished the game).

Whatever.Multiplayer has been nerfed to ridiculously low levels.  Now, beginners can play a game and go on par with MLG players(legit MLG players).  I'm not even joking.  The BR and DMR are rendered useless now that the AR is so overpowered.  Not only that, but with custom loadouts, the DMR and BR are rendered even more useless as a result of the AR being the favorite choice among beginners.  3 hits from an AR will take your shields down halfway, compared to just a quarter in Reach and Halo 3.Pulse grenades...absolutely useless, because anyone and everyone can avoid the implosion before it detonates.Ordnance...worst thing they could have added to the game, because now anyone can get a superweapon at any given moment in the match.  Or powerup at that, rather than having to wait until it spawns on the map, WHICH MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE.  I mean, rather than having players wait to get a chance at one superweapon, 343 goes and gives players the opportunity to become juggernauts with their powerups at any given moment, or like most often it occurs, the opportunity to become absolute camping warriors with their Incinerator Cannon's.Shotgun has been nerfed as well.  Sword lunging seems to been reduced to only two feet.  Plasma grenades can completely miss you by a large distance, and then whip back and stick you in the back of the head, after you watch it fly harmlessly by you.343 stated that they would make matchmaking in this game JUST AS fun as Halo 3's matchmaking was...fattest lie ever told.  They have not lived up to that expectation.  They said they would deliver, and they delivered alright.  They delivered the most incomplete game of the quarter century.Now, let's go onto Forge.343 said they were going to improve on Reach's Forge system and mechanics.  The ONLY thing that they managed to implement was the useful magnets and delete palette options.  That's it.  Seems they spent TOO much time on those two functions to even give any attention to the forge mechanics.  Atrocious forge mechanics.  It is no longer possible to create a symmetrical map like you could in Reach.  Not even with using the little unit nudging tool, or even magnets.  And they got rid of the finite nudging you could do by zooming in while holding an object, and lightly tapping on the right or left analog sticks.  That was perhaps 343's biggest mistake with Forge.Also, on the subject of symmetry, you can try to make a symmetrical map.  Good luck trying to line up matching pieces together on opposite sides of the map.  Take one side of a custom map for example.  Now, keep building on until you reach the side that mirrors the spot where you started.  Build a little further after that until you reach back where you started.  Now, see if you can make the pieces fit together properly without having a gap between the last two pieces.  Because that's how broken Forge is in this game.Basically, 343 promised to deliver us a fun and innovative new Forging system Halo 4.  Not only did they not do that, but they seemed to have managed to take 3 MASSIVE steps back in the evolution of Forge.  343 ACTUALLY managed to make H4's Forge WORSE than Reach's forge.  Hell, it's broken beyond hope.And those ""Forge"" maps they promised would make us all happy?  Yeah...utter jokes.  Can't even be compared to Forge World.  No even close.  That, and there's huge gaps in every maps textures.So, what did I do?I sold Halo 4.Best decision I ever made.Halo 4  worst game ever.  And I'm a Halo fan.",sheesh91

Absolutely reeks of it. Problems started from before the worldwide release of the game and are still continuing now. I'll list what I can remember in rough order.1. The webapp was released on 19th of September (after teasing us with the 18th) and within 24hrs was taken down again after thousands of people found an exploit allowing them an endless amount of free packs. This was the same exploit used in fifa12 a year earlier. EA took down the webapp and banned a lot of players. During this time there were of lot of claims that people had been banned unjustly and also that some had got away without a ban by transferring players/coins to another account.2. Shortly after the webapp was back online people discovered that they could not search the market due to a continuous ""oops"" error. Many were unable to login at all, never mind search the market.3. A major bug in the webapp preventing the proper club establishment being displayed was noticed by a lot of users upon the webapps launch. This has still not been fixed some 2 weeks later.4. Console users had the opportunity to buy an EA Season Pass allowing them exclusive early access to the actual fifa 13 game as well as discounts on packs. Many people paid for the early access but many were unable to log into the game.5. Upon the release of the game people in Australia discovered they were deceived by the marketing as they were not able to buy the game until a day after the advertised release. Some who have bought the retail game can play, yet those who pre-ordered could not log into the game or webapp.6. Fifa Points. This has been quite a fiasco. Normally you buy fifa points then spend them on packs but in fifa13  it's possible to buy points and not be able to spend them on packs at all.7. Trade Pile. Searching without an oops error seems to have improved a lot. However, there are mysterious things going on in everyone trade piles. Cards going missing for days, invisible cards taking up space, sold cards not showing up, coins going missing, bought/sold players stuck in transaction for days......8. Cheating. Both on the webapp and the PC cheating is rife on fifa13. On the PC people can apparently play 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, winning every single game and earning more coins than anybody else. People are using trainers to cheat their way through tournaments without even having to play collecting all the winners proceeds along the way. The same exploit was used throughout fifa 12 and no attempt was made to fix it then, or even now.9. Connection problems. As if EA didn't know how big their game was going to be they still can't manage a game that only requires two computers to connect to one another. Many people are having numerour connection problems, from not being able to access the webapp to not being able to play a single game without disconnecting during or at the end, resulting in lost coins and a DNF penalty.10. Ea Customer Service. There is none. Ea were voted worst company in the world last year (above all the crooked banks!). Their online suppoort chat consists of people replying from a script with no power to actually take action. They will disconnect from you if you start citing your rights and the law. Their phone service is better but last year it was abused to steal peoples accounts. They tweet advertisements all day long but do not keep people updated on how progress with fixing the game is going.Good news is if you don't play online and don't already own fifa 12 then it's the best football game out there. For everybody else I recommend you stay well clear!",dab88

221186,Fallout 4,PC,6,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        One of the biggest issues I have with this game is how boring and unmemorable all of the characters are.I don't care about my wife or my son and why should I? The game is trying to make me care about them, but I just don't. I've spent a total of 10 minutes with my wife and son and I'm supposed to care about them?There is no drive to complete the main story which is basically a copy and paste of Fallout 3's story only this time you're looking for your son instead of your father.Most side quests are generic and predictable. Fetch x, save y and the reward is caps 95% of the time.I also don't like how you become a Minuteman general and a Brotherhood of Steel member just because you didn't attack them on sight and instead helped them kill a few raiders and ghouls. All you have to do is complete a boring quest and bam, you're suddenly a goddamn general. It just doesn't make sense and it feels very rushed. You also get a power armor and a minigun with 1000 bullets literally an hour into the game.Graphics are simply ugly for a 2015 AAA title and the game runs surprisingly bad even on fairly good hardware (GTX 970, i5 4690k). There are some very bad textures and models in this game. The game's visuals are inconsistent. Certain areas look somewhat good and some look downright ugly.The animations have improved, but not significantly. The game still feels clunky and it's very obviously running on Gamebryo. The only significant improvements over Fallout 3 and NV are character creation and combat (shooting in particular). The dialogue wheel is a huge step back and I'm not a big fan of my character having a voice.The good:-improved combat and character creation-crafting systemThe bad:-unmemorable characters and generic quests-poor writing-voiced protagonist-terrible facial animations, bad lip sync-vague dialogue options-poor visuals and Gamebryo",BoatLoadOfSeame

63195,Bloodborne,PlayStation4,7,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Bloodborne is undoubtedly a hard game. I think the one on one gameplay is even more sinister than in the other souls games and doesn't excuse mistakes. That is nothing new. But this has to be pointed out, because you can't build a character to your liking in this game (f.e. most common tank in DS; RPG elements mostly missing) and therefore even if you are lvl 100 standard enemies still give you a run.Further problem for me was that the enemies are often just bad (f.e. eels which mostly cannot be countered due to their number and size). This is mostly an issue in the later part of the game where the enemies get re-used and altered and new ones with ridiculous attacks get implemented (f.e. the dude which stuns you and steals insights - you can't do anything against him if he hits).I really liked BB for most of my time playing it (80+ h) but sometimes you get to a point of real frustration and die often, which mostly consumes your blood vials and if they are gone you don't have any! Then you basically have to grind special enemies and areas for blood vials (unnecessary). After death you should always have enough vials again.The whole grinding part for itself is not good thinking. Not that the lvl grind is hard in the beginning but due to the lack of real grinding areas (f.e. lecture hall is soon exhausted and needs to painfully reload) it's really repetitive. And starts getting annoying after you are around lvl 60.The armor sets are basically cosmetic because the differences are marginal (electro fire physical etc.). I played through the game with the starting equipment and it was often the best. Furthermore for those cosmetic changes you have to grind hard later in the game (armor set cainhurst about 120000 or so blood echoes).As with all Souls games the impact of your decisions aren't that clear to you in the beginning and you often loose a lot to learn ""who to trust"". Well others might consider this a Souls thing and be good with it, i just found the lack of real consequences (besides items) and therefore your real interest rather disappointing. Make side stories memorable.But the biggest problem for me in this game was just the trial and error approach to different situations followed by a loooooong loading time each time. I mean come on, the swamp is poisonous that's all right but if you loose orientation you get ""frenzied"" all of the sudden (basically insta death). Nightmare mensis, I wont even talk about that really annoying but mostly unsatisfying part of the game. Why do I have to fight me through that area if the only goal is the lamp some way ahead. It is plain illogical and not fun.Obviously BB is a wonderful looking atmospheric game with basically good gameplay mechanics but lacks in the later part of the game really behind. I like a challenge but you can't deny you can over-exaggerate.It just so happens that the later part of the game seems to me like they have exhausted all their ideas (enemy design, location), there is no variety in it but therefore the more pain.",Sunykamey

The people look and feel more realistic than the robotic drones of Oblivion, and the game feels like it adds more opportunities and side quests than ever before. The main quest is very good, even if it is rather short, and the addition of the war in Skyrim gives you a larger sense of freedom as you can join either side. Now with the negatives, the game is bugged, and laggy, however this is to be expected with a game of it's size. Also the towns and cities feel darker and more depressing than Oblivion, and so do the guilds. Although thankfully the mindlessly dull dungeon treks have been brightened up by the addition of better designed caves and dungeons which makes the game much more new and exciting than Oblivion. So yes, the game is littered with bugs and lag, but it is definitely one of my favourite games of all time.",CursedKnight187

How can I give a rat's arse about a plot to save the crew of one tank when I've just wasted enough people to fill a football stadium? Honestly I can't see how this game is rating so highly because in terms of gameplay it's a step down in evolution from Rainbow Six: Vegas, in fact I'd say R6: Vegas has more going for it. Finally I'd also just say I resent the fact this is the most expensive PC game I've ever bought, with an RRP much higher than usual, and it's also one of the shortest single player games, and it's not even like it took much effort to make considering it's not even using a new engine.",PhilH.

Also, the first scarecrow scene was great, but they overdid it, I mean, 1 time = good, 2 times = still good, 3 times... errmm ok...? 2 times and 1 fight would've been perfect, but no, croc had to eat him.

On each level players can place units, ranging from machine guns to anti-aircraft guns, in specified locations each of which can be changed or upgraded at any point to best defeat the wave after wave of enemies attempting to reach your toy box. If enough enemies reach the toy box the mission is failed. The hybrid element comes in as at any point the player can take direct control over any unit and fire the turret manually. At certain points an overkill mode is unlocked allowing for an extremely powerful commando or helicopter to be dispatched and controlled to deal huge damage to the enemy.For a while Toy Soldiers: Cold War does provide a bit of fast paced arcade fun with a little depth provided by the choice of units that can be deployed. Mowing down wave after wave of enemies from a turret does become dull pretty quickly however and, other than a slight change in background, each level plays virtually identically for the most part. As a result it doesn't really offer long term appeal despite the inclusion of online leaderboards and a few multiplayer modes.Unless you’re a huge fan of the tower defence genre this is not a game that many people will play for all that long.",drlowdon

Though the creature creator is undeniably slick, its lack of impact on the simulation is appalling. The player exists in a world virtually without consequence, where creatures hang around their nests doing nothing, waiting for you to walk up and either wave hello, or eat them. In the tribal stage this becomes ""hold a concert or slaughter them"", in the civilization stage it becomes ""preach, trade, or slaughter them"".The worlds are fundamentally dead and boring past the glitter and sparkle. Their procedural nature fails to include any landmarks or points of interest. It's just a grid of nests, tribes, cities, which do little but wait for you to effortlessly dominate them.This wouldn't be so bad, if the stages didn't overstay their welcome and offered more. Am I seriously expected to play a game of ""Simon"", that never goes past 3 or 4 elements, over forty times just to continue as a social species? It's clear the designers wanted every creature made to be functional, so there's no element of experimentation when creating a creature. More often than not, a player will choose the interactions they wish to excel at (of which there are maybe a dozen of the canned little things), and splice whatever parts give them the best ability in that area, regardless of aesthetic. And just before the creature stage closes, revert to some more pleasing form.As other reviews have stated: This is a remarkable product. But as an interactive work it lacks consequence, challenge, and meaningful patterns. Spore is light-years behind the sophistication and creative insight of The Sims or Sim City. I would give Spore to a child or novice gamer in a heartbeat. If you have had ANY exposure whatsoever to the RPG or RTS genres though, play a friend's copy first.

Same thing for spell properties and damage.  You're given a DPS rating for the weapons in your hand but no average spell damage.  And the most mystifying thing of all is the character attributes.

What we have here is an offering that so far exceeds the original concept in every category that it impresses me in spite of my high expectations for it.The single player is one of the most masterfully paced experiences I've played since the early Modern Warfare Games. The multiplayer now features a permanent unlock system and does away with the burn card system all together. Progression feels satisfying and is always giving you new toys to play with as you work towards unlocking the next new toy. The abilities significantly, and smartly, change the way you play the game and result in emergent play styles that are fun and satisfying in their own ways.The presentation is polished to a satisfying degree resulting in a fairly constant, high frame rate throughout the game. The movement system, while impressively complex, is so well designed and executed that using it is intuitive and easy to understand. It's a point that easy to overlook until you look at other games that attempt to allow you to do half of what Titanfall 2 does with much less success.Combat is blindingly fast and satisfying from the moment you jump onto the battlefield till the moment you almost make it into the evac ship.My only criticism I have is that one can occasionally find themselves wandering in a barren battlefield due to running in the wrong direction after spawning. This issue will likely diminish as the prevalence of map knowledge increases over time but it can still creep up while many of us are still getting our bearings.Overall, Titanfall 2 is a game that impresses me directly in the wake up Battlefield 1 which also impressed me in a big way.

It is especially distracting when the fantastic musical score is drowned out by the non-sensical mumbling. This flaw was present in the original though, so I would still rate this version higher than its predecessor. 2) The D-pad allows you to control the camera, but occasionally it feels as if the camera rotation speed is just too slow to be effective.

Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” is already a classic, while Shakespeare’s works are ancient. The Greek Empire reigns supreme in the twin continents of Terra Australis and America. Its capital, Sparta, is the most prosperous, cultured and advanced city on the planet. Now, the most powerful military in the world, turns its attention to other shores, other worlds to conquer…”It could be a hell of a scenario.It is my current (first) playthrough of Civilization VI.How do you build a Civilization in Civ VI? The Settlers remain as they always were. The “Builders” (replacing the “Workers”) finally rid us of endless turns of waiting, finishing every job in a single turn. Alas, you can use a Builder ONLY THREE TIMES (later, with certain perks, more). However, over 50% of the work that the Workers used to do, is now a matter of city production. Enter DISTRICTS, Civ VI’s biggest step forward. Everything a civilization does – pursuing science, creating Great Works, generating a robust economy or building a mighty army, establishing a potent religion or appeasing your population with Amenities – has to do with Districts you construct for your cities. This is a very time-consuming endeavor, one that calls upon you to make wise choices, for a city’s tiles are NOT infinite, and those Districts are going to be there FOREVER, as will the stunning Wonders that you produce!Scientific advancement remains as important as ever. Civilization VI divides the Tech Tree in TWO fields of knowledge, which evolve concurrently, Science (no-brainer) and Civics i.e. perks that you choose (from a set of Policy Cards) to form and re-form your Government. Geography is more important than ever. Access to resources and terrain will be the make-or-break element in building Wonders and Districts, creating units, even BOOSTING scientific discoveries. The quests from City States help on that front too.You gain City State benefits by sending Envoys; if you send more Envoys than any other Civilization, you become their Suzerain, and aside from Gold, Faith, Culture, they become your allies. And since City States are so useful when they are on their own, be kind to them and let them deal with Barbarians only, not your armies.This time, Barbarians are SMART: they send Scouts to your cities. If those Scouts get a peek, they report back and soon you have many more Barbarians attacking AND trying to kidnap your civilian units! So, KILL those pesky Scouts the moment they appear! Thankfully, you can now BIND civilian and military units, essentially providing protection to SettlersBuilders, Religious units and those infinitely precious Great People.A robust Culture is your way of claiming Great People, in the process creating Great Works (housed in appropriate Districts!) to win the Cultural Victory, but also strengthen your civilization, by e.g. providing a window for additional policies or boosting your scientific advancement. Alternatively, you can FORCE Great People to be yours, with Gold or Faith. Yes, Faith is THAT powerful in Civ VI. Each civilization can get one Great Prophet and start either a Religion with predetermined tenets and symbols, or make an entirely new Religion from scratch. (I chose the Starry Turtle and founded the “Children of the Great A’Tuin”!)To spread your religion, you will build Missionaries, Apostles to (also) gain new tenets and engage in Theological Combat, and Inquisitors to “cleanse heresy” from your lands. But remember: defeating a Civilization that founded a Religion DOES NOT wipe out religious followers! They can continue to exist and flourish. And YOU can accidentally commit Religious Suicide if you are not careful WHERE you build your Inquisitors!As Leaders go, the AI in Civilization VI seems to be less random than in previous iterations. An example: early in the game, I met Scythia. Their Queen was proud and dismissive. But the moment I acquired a much more powerful military than her, she messaged me to let me know how she admires my forces. Then I got greedy and attacked a friendly City State. Since she HATES backstabbing, she hated me, and then Denounced me. But STILL, dozens of turns later, she was NOT as stupid as to declare war on me.With the lovely advent of Corps and Armies (comprised of two and three Units respectively) I expect I will at some point see colorful stuff, like Siege engines accompanying Tanks or some other unreal weirdness. But I LIKE weird; after all Civilization IS all about weird, alternate History.And this is where I stop. There are plenty of things left for you to discover. If I can say ONE thing that some people might choose to perceive as negative, is that the game CONSTANTLY FORCES YOU ON YOUR TOES. EVERY turn is potentially important. THIS, I see as Civilization VI’s greatest victory.",menthys

The dark, Gothic Victorian art direction make the game a joy to look at even after the graphics' age shows. The character design is brilliant, it is clear who every character is from a glance and yet they are twisted in a wonderfully dark way. Cheshire Cat's continual advice in a dark voice is fun to listen to, as is Alice's British accented continual disinterest in the inhabitants of wonderland. Areas are exciting and interesting to look at and examine due to the wide variety of settings and architecture therein. Twisted childlike music is very fitting and the menu theme is a great audio introduction into the game. Unfortunately I hardly noticed it once I got a ways into the game, likely due to my interest being in efficiently collecting what there was to collect and advancing the story. This is due to the lackluster gameplay which is simply average and generally unexciting, especially for the middle portion of the game. The game shines the most in simply exploring the interestingly crafted world as the combat fails to be exciting for the majority of the game. Exploding Jack-in-the-Boxes and Demon Summoning Dice are a couple of the many weapons which are interesting in design but unexciting to use after initially acquiring them. There is also a jarring difficulty spike when Alice is forced to fight the Jabberwock towards the end of the game. American McGee's Alice is a worthwhile experience merely to experience how to properly craft the parts of a game other than gameplay. It leaves you wanting more games with such style and less games with such dull gameplay.",Alexander

Developed by Rockstar and Team Bondi, L.A.Noire is not to be described as a typical similarity to Red Dead Redemption or GTA. The shooting and camera mechanics are still there, but its a whole new ball game from there. The player is put in the shoes ofL.A. Noire, a game that uses the next best thing( revolutionary facial animation) to create a very dark and violent 1940s detective story. Developed by Rockstar and Team Bondi, L.A.Noire is not to be described as a typical similarity to Red Dead Redemption or GTA. The shooting and camera mechanics are still there, but its a whole new ball game from there. The player is put in the shoes of Detective Cole Phelps, an incorruptible cop bent on finding the killer and putting the person in the gas chamber. He also has a face that makes him look really annoying( he got the cheeks and dimples on the face to back it up), which in real life would cause citizens to roll their eyes when he busts in saying ""LAPD guys( with high emphasis on the word ""guys"") I'm here ask to some questions"", but that's a bit off subject.Rather than present a shootout on every mission in the game, L.A.Noire relies more on dialogue and clue finding rather than combat to create a riveting and charming game. The player will first start out finding clues from a crime scene and then the meat of the package comes in, the dialogue. As Phelps the player must question witnesses and suspects to find clues and get an answer to the main question( who did it?). This is where the game makes use of the revolutionary facial animation as nearly all the time the suspects or witnesses will likely be holding back particular useful answers. It is up to the player to beat the questions out of the person( verbally)  to get the answers he wants. The game uses a 3 button mechanic for the conversations, but is very intuitive and engaging. If you think the person is holding back, doubt them, if you think they're lying, you better back it up with proof or your quest in finding the killer will get much more difficult.This is not a game for the action hungry crowd, but rather for the people that want a for once engaging story to play. The pacing of the game is to a certain extent flawed but picks up by the time of the second desk case,but people may lose interest as the game somewhat drags during the middle of the game. L.A.Noire's presentation is best described as game with a late night TV show like charm to it, as each case is presented with a backstory, with the case name popping up on the screen as though it's a new episode. The personal story of Phelps is much to be desired as the game merely focuses on the cases and not the character until the third act, which is the best part as it provides a subtle gameplay twist. The shooting may be a little to easy for experienced gamers but is not a big deal as it is merely there to put a bit of action between the dialogue and give combat and driving sequences with a 1940s charm to it. The music is top notch and is perfectly suitable for the atmosphere. Free roam is there, but restricted as you cannot kill civilians and get those all too familar star warnings, you are a cop after all. Instead they're just used for moving to and discovering locations to advance the story or to show off the admirable architecture of the landmarks of Los Angeles. The game's graphics are a bit more superior on the Playstation 3 but is not a big deal, nor should it be a deal at all. But rather, players should decide which control scheme are they used to when it comes to shooting sequences.Overall the game is not for everybody, but for those that want a truly different and original experience instead of typical action heavy games may want to give this game a try. As for me, I was not dissapointed. Just don't expect it to be the game of the year.",wb33brown

149374,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings,PC,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I am a fan of the Witcher series since I've read the books back in 2005 or so (and this fact really helped enjoy the game better) however even if you haven't read the books - this is a very good RPG in itself.The pros:+ Excellent graphics. Slightly different than in Witcher-1, and generally a bit better, as expected of a newer game.+ The combat system got improves since Witcher 1 - here it is MUCH more dynamic. No more click-rythm, instead you have to evade, block, and counterattack within tight moments after enemy attacks - to win a fight. It has a pretty good learning curve.+ In general - the game is quite difficult, even on Medium, and that's after having beaten Witcher-1 relatively easily.+ The nice ""dark fantasy"" world remains. Elves get racially discriminated against, town guards take drugs as bribes, and use said drugs... Witches are trying to survive the ignorant mod that fears and hates them.+ Triss. Deserves an individual notion :-) From the start to the finish of W-2, there's more interaction with her here than in Witcher-1, where she was just one of many interactable characters.+ Interesting characters in general. Each has personality. They are explored more than in W-1.+ No ""good vs. evil"" - just a lot of people (and other creatures) with their conflicting goals, feels and wants.+ With the above said - often you can decide who to help and how to judge those around you. You even decide whether a king gets to live or not!+ Not a lot of grinding, if any, for better gear. In fact you start out with quite decent gear: a Witcher's Steel and Silver sword, and not until quite late in the game can you find a weapon that's better.+ No **** quests like ""go hunt 10 squirrels and bring me the furs"". Most quests are backed with a story that something really bad happened, and only a Witcher can help the person in need.+ The quests feel on-the-spot, relevant to the situation. So unlike Commander Shepard saving the galaxy, and then being told to deal with some scumbags that stole something from a merchant, or the Inquisitor in Dragon Age looking for a lost cow.Cons:- Importing a save from Witcher-1 has minimal impact. Your imported weapons that were superior to anything in W-1 are there but they are inferior to many footsoldier weapons, for example. Same goes for your crafted Raven Armor. Didn't notice much plot contect that was linked back to W-1.- The locations aren't big. In fact they are kinda small.- Many rocks and static objects were copy-pasted around the levels in the most shameless way.- Can't jump/retreat during combat.- Often combat is initiated by a cutscene that puts you in a bad position. Sometimes you can tell what's gonna happen and wish you had control of the character, but no.- The cutscenes where you do have some limited control of the character - suck even more, because you have to do something, but can't do what you normally wanna do, and are forced to figure out what the heck does this particular cutscene wants you to click and when. Ugh!- Potions last 10 or 20 minutes of ingame time. No more long-term buffs.- Balance issue: the fire spell Igni is so overpowered that, once maxed out - turns into some Infernal Flamethrower of Doom that can be used as your sole weapon at defeating ANY and all enemies, including bosses. This pretty much defeats the purpose of learning to use the sword effectively - which is very challenging in a good way.- Unless you do side quests a lot - the game feels much shorter than W-1. High diversity of replayability though - depending on which side you choose the playthrough can be very different.But overall the cons are minor, and this is a great game, highly recommend to both fans of the Witcher world, as well as people looking for a good RPG in general!",ShodanSpectre

On the other hand, the main character is somewhat unique in that his major motivation is making money and he aggressively wants to avoid joining either of the warring factions. But the most important part of the story is that, unlike AC3, it is mostly unobtrusive.GRAPHICS: (9/10) - this is a gorgeous looking game in almost every respect.  There's a good variety of environments, from period cities of varying elevations (to facilitate the freerunning) to deep jungle to tropical islands.GAMEPLAY: (7/10) - this is kind of hit-and-miss, depending on what the game asks of you.  Each of the 4 gameplay types represents about a quarter of the experience:Ship-to-ship combat is good (7/10), kind of like space combat games if you couldn't move up or down, but what makes it interesting is a very developed, shifting 3D ocean that is constantly buffetting your ship and changing the angles.  I also like how quickly you go from sailing to aiming a side cannon at individual enemie on a ship, then swing over on a rope and go straight into hand-to-hand combat.  One nice touch is that you can sneak-swim onto an enemy ship that's otherwise overpowered for your ship, kill all the soldiers in hand-to-hand, then return to your ship and conquer the now weakened and crippled ship in one shot.  What I dislike about ship-to-ship combat is that, other than size and flag color, basically all ships you fight are identical in look and structure.  I feel like they could have designed more than one enemy for you.  Additionally, it would have been nice to go below decks for combat, instead of just up the masts once in awhile.Freerunning (3/10) hasn't really changed from AC3, but the environments are quite a bit better and smoother, particularly in jumping from tree-to-tree.  It's very intuitive, but it's still hold-down-a-button and point the analog stick, whereas any true platformer would require individual presses of the jump button.  There's also a swimming mechanic for underwater side missions, which is cool, but slow and eventually gets boring.Combat (5/10) has a few new enemy types that often require a different button press (i.e. ""stun"") to defeat certain enemies, plus the ability to throw enemies (off ledges or into other enemies) instead of insta-kill adds another layer.  And sometimes you have to press a button to grab a human shield just before you're shot.  But it's still way too easy to be fun most of the time.Stealth (5/10) is still functional but not improved.  It's still based primarily on moving between bits of grass and insta-killing anything that gets near.  Your only other options are a berserker dart (makes an enemy attack his friends), hire dancers to distract guards, and a smoke bomb escape; that's fairly paltry compared to any other stealth game.DESIGN: (9/10)The game starts with you experiencing the major gameplay types (ship-to-ship combat, freerunning, stealth, then combat) all the in the first mission with only a few seconds of cutscenes intruding on that.  There are FAR fewer enforced-slow-walk-for-plot-exposition parts than in AC3, though there are still some.  Similarly, you spend very little time in the ""future"" world outside the animus, another great choice, although even this half-hour total was still the worst part of the game.  I never even got to the sailing portion of AC3 because I couldn't tolerate the pathetic ""platforming"" and the fact that they buried the good stuff so late in the game, but AC4 understands that it is a game and puts its best feet forward.  There are a bunch of side missions, and you never have to do any of them more than once if you dislike one.  And if you just like open-ended missions where you get to a guarded target and assassinate him, there are like 30 of those as ""assassin"" side missions.  So it's a long game (21 hours) but it held my interest long enough for me to beat it.  If they could just make you actually press the ""jump"" button when they wanted you to jump and made the melee combat more challenging/interesting, this game could have been a 9/10 easily.",plotlesviolence

The newest offering Animal Crossing New Leaf delivers the same addicting gameplay with many new additions to keep you coming back for more.If you have never played Animal Crossing, the basic idea involves you living and interacting in a small town where the other residents are these adorable animals that want to be your friend. The home you live in is expandable and you can fill it with furniture collections and knickknacks. Your day is spent doing errands for your animal friends, catching bugs and fishing for bells. Because the game is in real time, as you go throughout your day so does the life in the town. Time and seasons change and occasionally there are town events like fishing tournaments or fireworks display.New Leaf has brought a more extensive and personal touch to the gameplay. Here is just a small list of the many new additions:The first player who moves into your town gets to be Mayor! Their duties include town ordinances and public works with the ability to spruce up the town with benches, flower clocks and other decorations.Expansion to the museum with a second floor that allows you to create your own showcase.New stores including shoes, a coffee shop where you can work part-time, and Club LOL that features nightly entertainment.Travel by boat to a cute island to play mini games and buy island or mermaid themed furniture.This is definitely a game for collectors, and as a collector of things, Animal Crossing New Leaf taps into my OCD with gusto! I do recommend checking out the Strategy Guide, either in book form or online, to keep track of your collections. As for the game play, I wish they had added more to the monthly events and happenings since they seem to be on the skimpy side. But even with that tiny complaint,  I still find myself checking in daily with the animals to see if they need anything, going shopping to find out what’s on sale at Nooks and stopping by the Roost café for a cup of coffee made with care by Brewster the pigeon. He knows my preference too, Mocha blend with 2 sugars and a little cream. Aahhh..perfect every time.A-",YeahYeahCool

The combat is extremely simple yet rewarding, the side quests are varied and engaging, and the storyline is absolutely over the top hilarious.As a long time fan of the show I do have to say however that people who are not familiar with the show will not have nearly as much fun with it as I did.  In the side quests, collectibles, and the story line there are hundreds of jokes that only people who watch the show would understand;  I feel like that was the part that most engaged me.  Although the game play itself was fun and rewarding, that is not what got me through the game itself, it was seeing which character from South Park would make an appearance next.I did not give this game a perfect 10 based on the facts above and also that the game was a little too short.  I hate to say this but I would 100% recommend to rent this game, it is not worth the full price $60 due to the fact it is only about 15-20 hours in length with doing everything in the game.One piece of advice I can offer anyone on the fence about this game as well is that if you are easily offended do not bother with this game.  I personally was not offended but did catch myself on numerous occasions saying things out loud like ""Oh come on!"" and ""No... no... are you kidding me"".  There are jokes and scenarios in this game that top any of the most offensive South Park episodes in recent memory.Overall though it is a great Role-Playing Game and homage to fans of South Park everywhere.  9/10 Would Recommend!",ichewonbagels22

Some people on Metacritic have criticized the game's Survival mode for being ""forgettable"". Those people definitely didn't play multiplayer. Minecraft, in any mode, is way more fun with friends. Either host your own game server, which you can download from the game's website, or join one of the many public community servers. Most of these servers are multi-world and offer a little bit of everything Minecraft has to offer. Setting up a server takes a bit of tech knowledge, but it only gets confusing if you're trying to run the server with mods or plugins.The combat in Minecraft is very basic. This part definitely could have been better. No matter what the enemy's preferred method of attack is, the combat of the player in Minecraft is nothing but ""hit it with a sword until it dies"", which can still be surprisingly intense when you're defending your home from the infamous creepers- silent, stealthy enemies that approach the player and explode, damaging the surrounding environment.And of course, that's the entire point of Minecraft- the editable environment. You craft tools and use them to dig or mine blocks, which can be blocks of dirt, stone, and even man-made or crafted materials like wooden planks and glass. The survival mode requires you to use tools to break blocks, while the game also features a creative mode, where players don't have to worry about enemies, and can access infinite amounts of any block and break them instantly, using this mode to create massive intricate building designs. Some even create pixel art using the various colors of wool block.The game's controls and mechanics- the inventory system and hotbar- are easy to learn on-the-fly. You'll be mining and crafting within minutes of creating your first world. Crafting in Survival is lacking something very important, however, and this is something that's bugged me about Minecraft since day one- there is no crafting tutorial! Games that use crafting systems usually tell you what items you need, but in Minecraft, not only do you have to know what items you need to craft, but you also need to know how to arrange them- a fact that's completely ignored by the game. Someone who's picking this up for the first time either experiments and screws around until he/she finally learns how to make a crafting table, or looks on the wiki for crafting recipes.The game is still constantly being updated and new content is being added. Bugs are still present, though they fix loads of them in every update and none of them are game-breaking. All in all, if you've got a creative mind and haven't picked up this game yet, you really should. It'll suck away hours of your time, but it's totally worth it.",Enforcer574

In Skyward Sword, the game is designed around the motion controls, and many of the controls don't feel like they could really be replicated without them.  They're very intuitive; my only complaint is at times they can be finicky -- i.e. they don't always respond to what you're *thinking* -- for example, you are thinking ""swipe this way"" but occasionally instead it swipes a different way.

164275,Pikmin 3,WiiU,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I am a longtime fan of the Pikmin series. I have been hoping for a third entry into the series since I finally finished Pikmin 2 only a few years ago. After preordering and picking up the game earlier this year, I can say I wasn't disappointed with it. The game looks beautiful in HD graphics. The objects appear almost lifelike within the game, from the fruit, to the characters themselves, while cartoony in appearance, they look great, and have an improved look compared to captain models from the first two games. I enjoyed many of the features the new entry, the WIi U Gamepad provides a great map view of the world, and is very useful in tracking down stray Pikmin, I had an issue with that on Pikmin 1 and 2, as night would fall as I was searching for said Pikmin. I found the 3 captain controls very helpful in the mission modes of the game, having the ability to send one captain to one area while focusing on another was a genius idea. While I was a bit distraught over the absence of purple and white Pikmin from the campaign, I was glad to see them in the mission modes, while they were replaced by rock and pink Pikmin that fly. The rocks are great for taking enemies out quickly, and the pinks are good for attacking enemies that fly above so they can be brought down for the other pikmin to finish off. The game did have a few flaws though, the campaign, while enjoyable and fun, was rather short in length. There wasn't that many mission levels to begin with, but that was made up for through the addition of DLC, all of which I have bought, and will continue to purchase as long as they keep coming, and creative levels are introduced. While I did understand that the story focused on the 3 captains from Koppai, I was somewhat disappointed from the lack of appearance from Olimar in the game, aside from the data files that were left behind. I was kinda surprised to see that all Pikmin types are allowed to carry Bomb Rocks (I am glad that this is a feature that returned) now, instead of just yellow Pikmin alone. It's what made the yellows stand out, aside from their electricity resistance, which they also kept from Pikmin 2. I liked how they implied from the beginning that Olimar was dead, that alone brought me off my seat, and beat my childhood over the head in the process. I can't say what exactly sucked me into the game, but I know for a fact that this is a great game for Wii U owners, current and future, to pick up.",Gamesaddict43

Maybe it just needs more to do in the world, more friendly npcs or factions as the planets feel very empty and robotic. No wildlife. No new enemy designs. The enemy AI is terrible. Single player campaign is cheaply executed. Raid finder modes not there since we're missing out if we don't know anyone or are part of a fireteam. Just ditch the raids and focus more on strikes which are better anyway. Rated this very low when it came out but I've realized it's much better than the first. It does better on some things and worse on others but what else in the shooter department has this much creativity without hindrances like Fallout 4's terrible base building add on that felt more like a chore. If you like science fiction and shooters this is great but please Bungie don't make it all about Eververse and pay to play or even just focusing on raids. Shaders should not be limited and just ditch the mods. Exotics too common and most of the time end up being the sames ones over and over. So much potential there it's just not being given any attention and instead focusing more on micro-transactions and whether or not you have raid fireteams. I get more enjoyment working with complete strangers in the strikes or crucible. It's like World of Warcraft when Blizz had enemies attacking the capital cities pre-Cataclysm. Those sorts of open events are way more interesting and offer more surprises than any raids. Raids are completely pointless and just a way for companies to cheat out solo players from epic loot and make you lazy by letting others carry you instead of bringing your own solo experience to the table.",Lightside

The worldWill you get your money's worth out of this game? Yes! I have 250 hours on a single character in this game, more than twice the hours than any other game in this series, and am on my second playthrough. This game captures the spirit of the Fallout universe perfectly. Not too serious but not too silly. There are funny moments, bittersweet moments, and ""OMG Lookatthat!"" moments. The world and environment are rich, and are almost characters in their own right. It's has the best storyline Bethesda has ever created, but beyond the story there is a huge wealth of content. The game is a fusion of RPG and FPS, but it's not an old school style RPG, nor is it a twitchy FPS. This is the best open world sandbox game I have ever seen. This is a game for explorers and builders. My advice is to turn off the quest markers and take one's time checking out the world, rather than trying to rush through the story line as fast as one can. One could compare this to a Skyrim with a better sandbox, or a Morrowind with better quests.The combat is far superior to the prior titles, but it doesn't need a twitchy trigger finger to succeed. The VATS system is now slow motion, instead of a time stopper that it was in Fallout 3. Bethesda has also doubled down on the crafting, which is optional for those that are not into that. The crafting includes chems, cooking, modding weapons, armor, and power armor, and even building your own network of settlements and caravans. Player freedom is everywhere in the game.Finally, the NPCs are superb. Nearly every NPC is unique, even those that are generically named ""Settler"" or ""Guard"". Even the raiders have personalities. The companions are the best in the series, with wonderful voice acting, and most with extensive backstories. They are no longer slavish followers, but have their own likes and dislikes. The player character is also voice acted, and while this may dismay some users preferring older style games, the acting is superb and does not detract from the roleplaying.I recommend this game for those who enjoy the Bethesda style of open world roleplaying games.",Brandybuck

206166,Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom,PlayStation4,8,"Ni no Kuni 2 adds a lot of great new gameplay mechanics. The Kingdom building has a surprising amount of depth and ties into almost all other aspects of the game. Unfortunately, it also left out a lot of the elements that made Wrath of the White Witch so good, such as collecting and taming familiars. The combat is also far less strategic and more of a hack and slash. The story was goodNi no Kuni 2 adds a lot of great new gameplay mechanics. The Kingdom building has a surprising amount of depth and ties into almost all other aspects of the game. Unfortunately, it also left out a lot of the elements that made Wrath of the White Witch so good, such as collecting and taming familiars. The combat is also far less strategic and more of a hack and slash. The story was good enough to keep me engaged but it lacked a lot of the nuance that made the first game great. Overall I really like this game. I think people who liked the first will also like this one and it offers something new but I don't think it is on the same level as the first in terms of story, characters, and combat.Gameplay 8 -  The thing I liked most about the gameplay is that it has a lot of variety, it is a mix between RPG, strategy, and city building but what makes it unique  is how all of those elements compliment each other.  Upgrading your Kingdom allows you to upgrade your weapons and magic in combat. Finding new citizens through side quests allows you to grow your population, upgrade your buildings and technology. Certain characters you find improve your military and give your army advantages in skirmishes. Dungeon crawling and questing can grant you new items that can be used to win over new citizens for your city. It all works fairly seamlessly together to make an addictive experience. On the downside, a lot of the side quests are just basic fetch quests. There is usually a bit of story involved but many of the quests felt like more of a chore than a fun immersive experience. Combat is also quite shallow. There are some cool spells but I found most of the time I ended the battle before even getting to use my more impressive abilities. There were a good number of boss battles but almost all of them  were quite easy. The enemies look better in this game than in Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch but there is much less variety. Since enemy monsters can't be tamed like in the first game it made combat far less interesting and there was less motivation to engage. The menu system is good but not as good as the Wizards Companion in the first game.Story 7 - The story is enjoyable enough, it has a lot of similarities to the first game while still having its own identity but it is more simplistic and has far less lore and depth. There are a few twists and turns but I found it fairly predictable. It kept me engaged but never really amazed me. I did appreciate that almost everything is well explained though and it does a good job of justifying how the world works even if it is fairly simple.World 8 - While I didn't like the world as much in this game as Wrath of the White Witch, it was still full of many interesting locations. Every area that you visit has something new to offer and all of the major cities in the game are totally different in terms of their design and culture. There are quite a few different dungeons to conquer and while there is a lot of repetition there is also a lot of variety. There aren't quite as many puzzle sections as I would have liked but enough to keep things interesting and fresh throughout the whole experience. The over world seemed a bit sparse but just like in the first games there are some really cool ideas both in terms of visual world building and lore.Characters 6 -  The game gets points for having a huge cast and each character that you recruit for your Kingdom has a little story. Considering that there are over 100 that is very impressive. Unfortunately I just found that almost none of them really evolved.  You learn almost everything you need to know about each character within minutes of meeting them. For an RPG of this scale I would have liked to see more depth and meaningful character development especially in the main cast members. Evan went through far less development than Oliver did in the first game. Roland's story starts out very intriguing but it failed to really build on that intrigue. Batu and Tani are kind of generic side kick characters who never really grow or have meaningful interactions with Evan. The main villain of the story is also far less interesting than the villains from the first game. I didn't really find any of the characters compelling.Visual Design 8 - The game looks very good for the most part. The anime style looks great in cities and dungeons. The character designs are simple yet appealing and the menus look good. There are some really good monster designs, although it would have been nice if there were more. The weakest part of the game visually is the over world and skirmishes. For some reason they decided to go with a different style for the over world in this game and I think it looks much worse. The big headed characters just look silly and I don't know why they chose to change styles because the first game over world looked better.Sound 8 - The music is great and voice acting was pretty good.",artificeprime

Character customisation: D2: Talent points and attribute points were assigned by players to their character.D3: Talent points are replaced by runes, and attribute points are spread automatically (not really mattering in the long run)Who wins? Diablo 3. Because in D2, the stats that were put by players were enough strength to wear an item, and the rest would get dumped in vitality.  The mechanic was annoying, and the new attribute system takes care of that hassle. 2. StoryD3 does not fail to deliver storywise. Where D2 revolved around the character, D3 revolves around the important figures of the world, with drama between all of them, and the Character as the mediator for world issues.3. Gameplay.Difficulty levels make a difference. In D2, a champion mob even on the highest difficulty setting would be just xp or gems/runes/magic items. In D3, a champion mob on a higher difficulty means dying most of the time.The bosses feel like a challenge, and no longer just an itemcheck. You need to think about the spells you bring in to the fight, and you need to have tactics.4. ArtCinematics and music is just superb, and this is already common for blizzard games. It is good to know that they invest in good quality cinematics and good ambient sound.Voice acting on the other hand was not of the highest quality, killing some of the immersion.5. Auction house:As items are not bind on equip/pickup, item value will decrease very fast. As far as gold action house goes, this will allow players to have access to items they wanted without the necessary grinding. As far as real money auction house goes, it is simply a way to make a passive income as a company, after the game has been launched, and prevent illegal gold selling. This is common business logic in today's market, that we as gamers have shaped. Certain products gained profit over this method and will continue to, so obviously every other game will have this feature. My opinion is we should not judge the game based on this, but rather the company.6. The Always-Online-DRMThis is something no gamer agrees with. Although this may sound like an excuse, there is a reason behind it, and it is linked to the above point. Duping was a major issue in Diablo 2, and if the developers wanted to make a stable auction house, and especially a real money auction house, every item drop, stat, and inventory needs to have server side checking. This is why single player is online. So a user cannot simply hack items into his inventory so that he could earn a profit. This is understandable.What is not understandable on the other hand, is the fact that on a European server, with a 100 MBit connection, a user would have 300 ms lag(from Europe).

The characters in Heavy Rain are only fleshed out briefly when they are introduced, then fail to grow or change throughout the rest of the story. They often act with little to no motivation other than forwarding the game's senseless, hackneyed plot and consistently spout awkward lines covered in bad American accents. As a plot-driven game, these are all fatal flaws. I'm left wondering if those lauding Heavy Rain are just lying to themselves, have lower standards for what is considered ""good"" for a video game, or are just too ignorant to know any better.",NathanB

47148,BioShock Infinite,Xbox360,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This does contain spoilers folks. I got the game at it's midnight release, and the ONLY REASON it has a 9 in place of the 10 was the campaign took all of about 10-11 hours (that was with me milling through everything) and once you're done, you're done. (Unless you're up for the more difficult 1999 mode) So let's get into the game, from the moment you land in the church, the music was (In my opinion) mastered to the place. You get that feeling of a child when he's first taken to an amusement park, my eyes were lit up when you step out of the church doors and that wonderful view of Colombia in the skyline. Going through the game, shooting was great, considering this IS NOT A FULL BLOWN SHOOTER, you cannot expect it to be like one and still have all the other mechanics. My favorite thing? The connection with Elizabeth, (I was personally hoping they'd fall in love, BAD IDEA considering the end) but the connection they have established was phenomenal, definitely one that is seldom experienced. When you go to rescue her a second time, you only want to inflict as much pain as possible once you see the first chair and hear her screaming, the blood on the floor and all the tools to leave to your imagination what was happening to her, and when you do save her, and you pull that giant needle out of her spine, I personally was tearing up a bit. Overall, easily the best game I've ever played. Story has great twists, and I have concluded that hell hath no fury like an un-siphoned Elizabeth. Semper Fidelis everyone!",tylermcleod

This isn't the only issue. The game is easy and very short and it doesn't present you with particularly inventive puzzling. Also, many of your items come far too late in the game for you to fully explore. Overall the characterization is the saver here - Linebeck, the dopefiend captain is often on hand to slack off and add some foppish wit to proceedings. As is his ex flame Jolene who's attempts to chase him down reveals a more adult theme for the older gamer. This is a personal score of 91% for me.

If this is your first time picking up a Mario Kart game, I would recommend Mario Kart Wii over this game, if you already have a Wii or Wii U. So why don't I like Mario Kart 8? They changed things that didn't need to be changed. It felt like they took content out. They added things that didn't need to be added. And worst of all, it feels like it was lazy. I'll get the positive things out of the way now, because I'd like to put more emphasis on the negative aspects. The game is fun, as usual. The game is gorgeous, too. The graphics are very nice to look at, the music sounds pretty good. They added a Piranha Plant power-up, which I thought was a strong and good addition- it chomps every few seconds, giving you a small boost each time and grabbing/attacking anything on your screen (even the Blooper that sprays ink). They also added a Music Box power-up, which was an excellent addition because it sends out a shock wave around the user, flipping any nearby enemy drivers and destroying any incoming hostile projectiles (including the Blue Shell) or any bad things left on the road. It's a power-up that requires skill and timing, and there can never be enough of that. Online mode is pretty smooth, I've never lagged and I've never had any problems finding people or connecting. Bikes were also made more similar to karts, which, while it takes away some of the uniqueness of bikes, adds a bit more balance to the game. The game also lets you take on the Grand Prix with your friends, something that should have been added a long time ago. That's it for the good. Time for the bad. And there's a lot more of it. When I first started the game, the first thing I did was look up a list of specific prerequisites to unlock characters (sorry, I didn't feel like finding out for myself), and the characters themselves. When I found something to read, it told me that all the characters are unlocked in a random order. That's stupid. In Mario Kart Wii, there was the more difficult-to-get Dry Bowser, who seemed awesome. And you know how you unlock him? By getting a one star rating or higher on all the new 150cc cups. Not too difficult, but was definitely satisfying to complete that specific goal and have that character waiting for you as a reward. Dry Bowser is just my favorite example- there are plenty of other characters that were unlocked in many different unique and specific ways. Mario Kart 8, however, has the universal method of coming in 1st place in any cup, unlocking one character per gold trophy. So you can't just go for the characters you want by taking on specific challenges- you just play and hope the game gives you the character you want (if there are even any on MK8's roster). My experience works out perfectly for this review- the only character I wanted was the last one I unlocked. That was real nice. Oh, and yeah, I only cared about one- Rosalina. The rest of the roster was garbage. They used all 7 Koopaling bosses from the original Super Mario World. While I was amazed and happy at first, realizing that they put ALL SEVEN of them in the game ruined any kind of excitement and nostalgia I felt. That was a lazy choice. And in case there weren't enough babies, Baby Rosalina joined the fray! Because, you know, we need more of the same exact character. Metal Mario is kinda cool I guess. Lakitu is okay, I love Rosalina, and the heavy/metal versions of Mario and Peach were fine. But, in my opinion, the rest of the roster was lame and lazy. 2-player split screen was made worse. The screen is now divided with a vertical line instead of a horizontal one, making your vision of what you actually need to see worse. Battle Mode was butchered. This one was painful. Remember those fun, arena-like tracks where you could have balloon battles in a frenzy? They're gone. The new selection of courses to battle on are just a few of the actual racetracks from the game. This was one of the stupidest decisions they made. They added some power-ups that are horrible. There's a Coin as a power-up now. It gives you a barely noticeable speed boost and two coins. Useless. There's also a Boomerang, which is seemingly impossible to aim. The ""8"" is stupid too, because it consists of 7 mediocre power-ups and a Star. But you have hardly any control what order they're used in, so I just mash the button until I get the Star. If you hold a power-up behind/around you now, like a banana peel, it doesn't empty your item slot. This takes away strategy from the game. Finally, the new anti-gravity mechanic is practically unnoticeable. I'm sorry to end it so abruptly, and I had more to say, but I'm reaching the character limit.

What I do have a problem with is their personalities. They decided to make the character of Dante particularly edgy and childish - I'd go as far as to say somewhat annoying. Some of the characters are even a little bland and stereotypical - take Kat, she strikes me as a perfect example of a two-dimensional, helpless female character clinging to Dante and Vergil and being constantly emotional. And yet we've heard nothing said about this from feminists - despite other, better developed female characters from more popular series being ripped to shreds by feminists for not being a perfect portrayal of a strong independent female who don't need no man (Anita doesn't care anymore, she's sitting pretty on $8.5 million.)The writing is ham-fisted but sometimes catches me off guard by throwing in a genuinely funny insult. The ending is what I'm annoyed about, it was totally unnecessary to have it go all pretentious and pseudo-Shakespearean with the twitter thing, Taneem including himself in the game and the whole ""Vergil becoming the bad guy"" completely outta nowhere. It just wasn't needed. It might have worked as an interactive trailer for the dlc that's set to come out surrounding Vergil, but as part of the story? It just doesn't make sense - it should have ended after Mundus was defeated (a laughable boss which would have felt more like a tutorial level in older games)The level design looks nice, and plays well for a while, but it gets old rather quickly and the platforming doesn't really develop in any way. By the end of the game I'm bored out of my mind, willing what little combat there is to help remind me why I'm still playing this game. Aesthetically, the design looks really nice, so at least there's that.The combat (arguably the most important part of any DMC game) had me worried. for instance, I was worried about it not having lock-on. that seems to be a non-issue, but the fact that the difficulties are supposedly easier is awful because that's completely unlike every other game in the series. It's meant to kick your arse until you get it together and start playing well - SSS is a rank to be proud of, a real achievement - not something you attain for spamming buttons.The difficulty settings have one saving grace however - the inclusion of the mode ""Hell and Hell"". This mode pushes players to avoid any and all hits, due to Dante dying in one hit himself. THIS SHOULD BE UNLOCKED BY DEFAULT. Why do I have to play through easy mode just to get to a point where I can actually have fun?Overall, I give the game a 4/10, however it would have received a 6.5/10 if I'm feeling generous and ignore the fact that it's a reboot of a very popular series of good games. It just doesn't capture what the DMC series is about - cheesy retorts, action, badass fight scenes and most importantly, difficult combat. In addition, while it does have the makings of a decent stand alone game, it's let down by the writing and character development as well as repetitive level design and easy-mode fights.",Ephesus

Each environment is a treat to explore and the player is rewarded heavily for searching every nook and cranny of buildings and areas. Items are scattered about the wasteland, and each has the potential to be useful. With the new building and crafting system, Bethesda has made it so that any single piece of gear, armor, or junk can be broken down into materials that can be used to upgrade guns and armor, or build various items for settlements.

The amount of one-liners here and there and dialogue as you're walking around and playing instead of in cut-scenes is fantastically done. There is, again, a nice blend of fighting, parkour-esque moving around, and puzzles. There are a lot of different twists and turns to this game too, and the amount of scenes that really make you feel like you were controlling an on-going action movie is pretty freaking awesome!!!

Here are some reasons that I am dissapointed.First, the story is abysmal. Without going into too much detail, it is a bland linear plot with boring characters and poor progression.  The dialogue options are terrible and don't effect really anything. Compared to the Witcher 3, your choices really do not matter at all.The quests in this game are the worst of any Bethesda game, especially the side quests. They are all ""go here kill this"" or ""go here fetch this"". There is an absurd amount to do but very little worth doing. Its progression for the sake of progression.The new construction system doesn't ""just work"" as advertised and is actually really buggy and annoying. Fences are stuck to going awkward directions that never work, structures don't snap to 90 degrees and are impossible to get right. Scrapping materials seems like a waste of a lot of time. Providing for the people in the settlements is tedious and unrewarding. Basically everything about it is disappointing.Gameplay is the worst of any modern shooter.  I know VATS is pushed heavily, but it seems weird that the game never introduces it in any way shape or form. Also, VATS now slows down time instead of stopping it, ridding of the series turn based roots, though actually one of the few changes I enjoy. Overall combat is terrible and seems like just another obstacle in every quest rather than creating an experience. With modern games such as the Witcher (I know I've already mentioned it) making combat into something that is really unique and challenging, Fallout ops instead to make it boring and almost unusable.Graphics in the game look like Skyrim with some extra lighting and slightly improved textures. In fact, modded Skyrim is far better looking than Fallout 4 on ultra. Also, Fallout is incredibly unoptomized and cripples even the best rigs (I am running it on a 980 and intel 6700k with 16 gigs of memory and still can barely run 45 on ultra and still am less than 60 on high with frequent dips below 20).I was a huge fan of Skyrim and Fallout 3, but unfortunately just as war never changes, neither do Bethesda's games. It has been a pretty bland and unmemorable experience so far, and the game is increasingly frustrating and feels like it is from over a decade ago. If you are considering buying the game, please wait until it is further optomised or just don;t at all. It is a mess.",theodoreschmai

If you like old games, or hell, even scary ones for that, you should give it a shot,if you want to try out the survival horror genre, you could try, but like most of the peopleI know, you might pass on it. So even though I gave this game a high rating, I still don't recommend thisgame all in all to EVERYONE but the people who know whats in the package and/or have played games in the same genre. Not that thats out of the way, you may continue onto reading this review)(ORIGINALLY POSTED ON:  March 21, 2014)This game is epic, really. Now, I wouldn't praise it as ""THE BEST HORROR INDIE TITLE OUT THERE EVER"" because, while it is a thrill and joy to be playing, it just isn't the best ever. First of: the controls. They work at times, but you will find yourself in moments where the controls outright feel awkward, the shooting works, but its not always plan a and if you want a GOOD ending, it's best you barley even use it at all. Second off: gameplay. This game can be fun and shocking, at the same time, the horror is there, and this game is not action driven (DEAD SPACE *COUGH* *COUGH*), and thats where this ""survival"" aspect takes a turn for the better. As I mentioned before, some of the controls can feel awkward, and while this doesn't affect the gameplay too much, it still makes some areas harder than they should have been! And finally: you will get stuck... ALLOT! unless you don't have the right mind to know what to do next, or if you don't have a walkthrough with you, this game can be a real pain in the butt. Thirdly, the music and sound design. The music feels catchy, scary, and sometimes nice. Sound plays a major part in this game, or does it? sure its nice to have sound on to know exactly where monsters are, which is a cool concept so your not forced with the peek-a-boo method. I also like how you stick with a pistol and a pistol, because then it can focus more on the horror aspect, and less on the ""LETS SHOOT EVERYTHING WE SEE CALL OF DUTY STYLE"". And lastly, replay value and lasting appeal. While some may argue that this has no replay value, it seems... false. If you DON'T know what I'm talking about look no further then the multiple ending. There are three endings, the red ending, the blue ending, and the green ending, its easy to guess which ending is which but if you haven't figured that out yet, here's what each colors ending represents: RED ENDING/PILL = BAD ENDING, BLUE ENDING/PILL = BAD/GOOD ENDING, GREEN ENDING/PILL = GOOD ENDING. It's not easy to get the good ending ether, which adds on the challenge of NOT massacring everything you see, and the replay value of ""well i got the blue/red ending, might as well try again"". The lore behind this (to me) was interesting, though for some the endings are hard to figure out, unless you've gotten time to think about them, or you watched an explanation video of it. Another problem about this game is that while the lore/story overall is good it can be hard to explain without giving away spoilers of any kind. Also, the game can be found as short, depending on how well you play it (LIKE MOST VIDEO GAMES), if you find it easy, or this is your second time playing it, you may finish it within 1, 2, or 3 hours, but if this is your first time, 3, 4, 5, 6, or heck even 7 HOURS. Another awesome thing is that if you have a Playstation plus account you can get this for free right now (but I didn't come to spread the word).9.75 OUT OF 10PROS:-Smart gameplay and/or mechanics-Interesting story-Great use of horror-Awesome soundtrack-Controls are good most of the time but...CONS:- ...it can feel awkward sometimes-Can be found as short",lazatoy

Thankfully though, they've improved on enough, and added just enough to make this a worthy purchase.The gameplay itself is mostly unchanged, save for a few additions. The shooting is frantic and fast passed alone, but throw 3 other players into the fold, and enjoy as pure chaos ensues. The 4, soon to be 5, different character classes all play well with each other strengths, and the skill trees have been reworked to give much greater customization. Borderland's 'Bazillion' of guns are even 'Bazillionder', as the box says, with the inclusion of a new element 'slag'. The variety of grenades, shields, class mods, ect. have all been greatly improved on as well.The story in the first Borderlands was almost completely forgettable, but it has received a lot more work this time around. Well written and humorous, the cast of bizarre characters and settings offers a quirky, interesting story throughout. The side quests may get dry from time to time, but the excellent voice work and unique characters will keep you listening to every line of dialog regardless.In terms of pure quality, the graphics are fairly lacking. However, the insane, cell shaded style keep it a pleasure to look at, and the chaos during battles offer plenty of eye candy. Get enough chaos going at one time however, and there will be some drop in the frame rate. This doesn't happen too often though, and isn't always too consequential.Borderlands 2 is definitely an worthy purchase, and with at least 4 more dlc packs on the way, I look forward to playing this game for a good long while.

So is it worth buying?The story follows Jak and his sidekick Daxter on their adventures. Each game has its own standalone story although they have a overall story arc going through all 3 games. The story in Jak and Daxter is quite light hearted and funny. The story in both Jak II and Jak 3 is much darker but retains it’s comedy element mainly due to Daxter.First off, the graphics in the HD remake are only ever so slightly improved, there isn’t a great difference,  however the games still look great considering how old the games are. The animations of the characters are solid and at times better than some recent titles. The game also has 3d.  The music and voice acting are also very good, I still found Daxter just as funny as he was years ago. Overall the graphics are good, music and sound is ace and it is certainly surprising that they are still brilliant by today’s standards.The Jak and Daxter Trilogy has the mainly the same control scheme over 3 games.  Jak and Daxter: The precursor Legacy has the main and basic controls that are in all 3 games. Jak 2 adds in vehicles, weapons, jet board and dark eco jak controls. Jak 3 keeps the same controls overall.  In terms of gameplay, the controls are quick and responsive and simple yet are full of depth.Much of the 3 games consist of platforming and combat gameplay. The First game is mainly based on platforming with some combat elements thrown in, the second game has more combat and somewhat less amount of platforming and Jak 3 has a mix of both.There are some minor faults in the gameplay, one that I mainly noticed was the lack of checkpoints during missions. There is nothing more frustrating than killing 39 out of 40 enemies and die by the last enemy and have to start all over again. Also the difficultly is not very consist, One mission could be easy and the next one can be very difficult. However, you will endure and survive just due to how good the game is.Finally, trophies are added and easy to obtain, but jak is truly enjoyed for its fun gameplay and refreshing experience compared to all the violent and serious story stories in games.So is it worth buying? Most definitely, if only for nostalgia, it is a great change of pace from other games and still stand as great games half a decade on.(This is also my very first review so I apologise if it is not perfect)",tmcm147

You might label it ""popcorn RPG"" ( Dungeon Crawler ), played in short bursts. Rather, gaining new armour, trinkets, and weapons can be addictive. You might end up playing over an hour. Especially with shared storage. There is a character retirement feature, where you bestow new benefits and perks. It sounds interesting, but not sure what it means yet. The levels layouts change ( for each character )But, understand the random sections of the level are reused through the game, except for areas that have different textures. So, though the layout might be new, it will still seem familiar. Being the Dungeon Crawler that it is, the action can get wild. Sometimes too wild. I often lost my character in a mess of magic, explosions, and other animations. But at the same time the game offers skills and spells to take on hordes. Lastly, you get a pet that can fight along side, and be morphed into different creatures for new abilities, for a short time. Best of all they can sell your junk back to town as you continue running a dungeon. The music is calming and doesn't drown out other aspects of the game. But there are maybe 2 or 3 tracks I've heard. With all that explained it's not a breakthrough in RPG, But it's FUN. Don't let anyone have you think otherwise. So, for $5.00 sale who could go wrong? I would still buy it for $15.00.

I'd say this is because those games both had distinctive cultural themes; being incredibly surreal and Viking-like respectively.Having now seen what Morrowind was like, I think I'm ready to finalise my score for Oblivion. Let's get the worst parts of Oblivion out of the way first. Compared to both Morrowind and Skyrim; Oblivion feels much more generic and lacking in any distinct theme. I'd say this is because those games both had distinctive cultural themes; being incredibly surreal and Viking-like respectively. The quests themselves still have an interesting variety to them, from simple fetch-this quests to more complex place-to-place quests which I think Bethesda should starts focusing on more rather than pad out games with grind missions. The graphics are adequate, but the environments lack any real distinction from one another and characters have a strange uncanny valley look to them during conversation. Voice acting is also uneven, but Bethesda should no longer lose points for that. The combat would indeed be accurate of real-life swordplay if the combatants both fought by slapping each other with pieces of cardboard. Anyway, enough negatively, let's talk positive. As I said, the quests have a nice variety to them and the main story is alright, if uneven. The environments are nicely designed and the scoring is typically excellent. Of course, above all else remains that sense of true, organic open-ended game-play that Bethesda is renowned for. As a whole though, Oblivion is still an excellent game that is let down by a lack of identity among other Beth games. By the way Bethesda, you don't need to pad out the game with radiant quests, you should focus more on making more of though long-winding quests like they had in Morrowind. Skyrim was a step in the right direction, but man up Bethesda! You have nothing to lose if you make another game as unique as Morrowind!",FFStudios

The story is interesting and not cookie cutter. It is semi faithful to the books, though not completely consistent with some breakthroughs from TW1 imports. It's beautiful looking and the sound score is interesting. The characters seem to have depth and you can feel attached to some of them.On the bad side the controls are inconsistent and grating. As an action game it's horrible, and as an RPG it relies far too much on action elements. If you were to hold up games like Assassins Creed or Arkham Asylum as simple action games that have compelling and inclusive combat systems, TW2 is a jarring and horrible system where neither of your two attack buttons provide any positive or visceral feel; and you spend most of your time trying to not die. The assumption is that you will begin every fight hopped up on potions, setting traps, etc. but it ends up just being tedious. To produce potions you need to gather/buy/borrow/steal ingredients. To produce traps and such you need to find a craftsman to produce these items. Every combat in TW2 is like an MMO raid where you're farming ingredients just to produce the items you need to beat up a few petty thugs. And even then, it's likely you're going to beat the tar out of you, and only your massive health regeneration from potions is saving you.The menu system is extremely non-intuitive and terrible if you try to use the gamepad controls in the game. Which is unfortunately, because you need to spend a lot of time in the menus micro-managing your inventory weight, your item productions, your recipes, and every other aspect of an extremely tedious consumables system.The camera is terrible. It perches on your shoulder, with no way to zoom out, and is generally staring you in your face while people beat on you. There's a target lock system, but since parrying is directional and you can't dodge or parry many actions, it's difficult to stay locked on. The free-form locking switches intermittently for no foreseeable reason, causing you to suddenly lunge past the person you were fighting to try to stab someone out of range behind him.It's a confusing thing to hear the AI actors talk about how scary ""The Witcher"" is, when in fact he happens to be one of the more pathetic combatants in the game. In certain parts you're left cowering behind your female companion waiting for her to save you from the incoming hordes. Gone is the Geralt of TW1 with his acrobatic attacks and theatrical swordplay. It's replaced by mostly blocking, rolling away, or running away. The combat in TW1 was odd, with other creatures and terrain getting in the way of clicking them to continue your combos, but it generally worked. If you had the time to actually watch Geralt (instead of waiting for the next ""click to continue the combo"" icon) he was an impressive killing machine. Not so in TW2. So, if you can overlook the worst fighting system I can actually remember playing in the past 10 years, and an overly tedious inventory and consumable system; the rest of the game is brilliant. I find playing it in short bursts helps split up the tediousness of it and let's the strengths shine through.",Wraeththix

Well I've been playing Madden ever since I was 10 way back in 1992 and this is the very first Madden that I didnt want to play anymore despite their problems. I had so much hope for this years  edition of madden since the aggressive catch was toned down and with new announcers I figured it just had to be better . I understand the game gets a lot of hate from people saying ""its the same every year"" and I am not one of those people because its football its going to be the same pretty much. This is by far the most bug filled Madden or almost any game I have ever played in my entire life and I've played some terrible games. The new ""features"" are mostly big flopping turds. In order to address the past issue of a qb squirting the ball out animation ea has overcompensated  by making almost every sack becoming a fumble. This does not fix the problem and all it does is substitute 1 bad animation for 1 game breaking one.No qb at any level anywhere would fumble this much. It would easily equate to 35 fumbles per season. How is that realistic? Well it isnt at all.The fact that people can spam the strip ball button to generate a strip is terrible. The way to fix that is if someone spams the button the game makes that player whiff and stumble. It is never a good idea to reward bum players. The same with the interception. People shouldn't be able to spam y or triangle because it should be about reading the offense and making a play on the ball. Middle linebackers are still able to bat and pick balls that would realistically be well over their reach. a linebacker who is 5 yards off the line shouldn't be able to get close to a 25+ yard pass and in real life you would look like a complete moron trying to jump in that situation with your hands out expecting a interception and your coach would throw you into concussion protocol right away. Its nice that ea makes patches during the season to address some of the bugs but games shouldn't be released with day 1 patches in mind as in my mind a game that needs patched and still releasing it is just spotty work and sadly is the norm in the gaming community as a whole and shouldn't be accepted. Instead of fixing glaring legacy issues with the game such as above mentioned mlb issues and warp tackles  the game wants to focus on presentation and the need to change the kicking meter as if that is what the fans were clamoring for. At the end of the day this game is nothing more then a shiny turd. Yes to a review publication it may look all nice for those unearned high review scores but the more you dig into it the more you see and smell that it is just a turd. Sadly Madden 17 you belong in the trash. Its just to bad that ea doesn't have any competition in this genre because im certain it would rate higher among fans and reviewers alike and the only reasons this game sells is because it is the only option and mut. With decreased pack odds over the past few seasons ea just wants to milk more money from the players and that is a extortion scam I no longer will be apart of.",solsunforge

I was very confident that I would be getting one, so I looked into some possible games that I would like. It didn’t take me very long to find Blizzard's new console creation, called Overwatch. It was recommended on many websites that I looked on, (Amazon, Gamestop, and blockbuster) I was very interested in the game from the start. I watched many  trailers and game play videos, to make sure this was the game I wanted. I loved it, I couldn't wait to start playing it. I showed my parents, and they thought it also was a cool game except for how pricey it could get. You are required to buy Ps plus / or Xbox Live which gets pretty pricey, and the game itself which costs forty dollars.Christmas morning I found out that I was correct, I got the Ps4 and Overwatch. I hurried down and set it all up and shortly was able to play. The game immediately introduces itself with the characters explaining why you were chosen to become apart of their elite force of heroes. You are then sent to a screen that has many game modes including season three, quick play, arcade, custom, and player versus AI.Quick play is my only a shorter game that you play against people who are your level. In arcade mode there are many different types of game modes including three Versus three, the event mode, no limits, brawl list, and Mystery hero. The most recent event mode was, capture the flag. No limits is where there is no limitations on the hero's your team chooses. Brawlist is a playlist of different events. like everyone has to be one hero, or everyone has to be a Certain type of hero.When you choose one of these game modes you enter a skirmish while you wait for your main match to load. In this skirmish you can try out new characters and the map. I really love this feature because instead of having to watch the loading sign as you wait for a match you can play with other people that are also waiting for a match. Once your match has been found they pull you out of the skirmish and bring you into your match. Your then put in a kiosk where you choose your hero. After everyone selects their hero you enter the map. The teams wait in different ends of the map, until everyone is let go at once and you fight. At anytime when you die, you can change your hero to change the course of the match. After the match ends you watch the play of the game, and you get exp. you use the exp from the match to level up.In the end my point is that this a very good choice if you are choosing a new game to play. The animation is much better than any other game I have played. I truly believe that this game has great  potential for the future, I don’t see this game getting old. It always has new ways to bring back there players. New events come out often, keeping the game up to date. Overwatch has also received many awards such as game of the year, Best Studio/Game Direction, best multiplayer of 2016, and many more. I rate this game 4.5 stars.",Keaton_Miller10

There are plenty of quests to do, people to meet, and dragons to kill.  However, none of it is really innovative.  Other than dragons Skyrim doesn't really add anything new to the Oblivion formula.   Just about everything that made Oblivion good is there, and not much else.The graphics are beautiful, the game-play is smooth for the most part, the dialogue and voice acting are top notch (even if voice actors are reused ad naseum).  Sadly the game has a serious number of little flaws that, when added together, really make Skyrim and overall disappointment.Starting with the interface.  Definitely developed with consoles in mind.  For PC users it's slow, clunky, and just plain bad.  Even using my 360 controller with the PC version of the game it's just not right.  This is probably why I don't own a console, this minimalistic design scheme is weak and uninspired.The interface is most troubling because it gets in the way of the meat of of any RPG; combat.  You'll often find find yourself accessing the inventory several times through combat to change spells, or drink potions, or switch from dual wield to weapon and shield.  Even with the ""favorites"" button which can cut time navigating the menus it still becomes an annoyance breaking up the flow of a particular battle and ruining the overall experience.Moving on to keyboard controls they are just plain screwed it up.  Even after the patch I cannot make my own custom keyboard setup as the game fails to save any of the changes I make.  And the default controls are a mess.  They could have taken some hints from some of the modern day standards instead of screwing it up just to be different.  Different isn't always better.The level and skill advancement hasn't changed much from Oblivion, except now you can choose various perks from high skill levels that used to be automatically assigned as you progressed in Oblivion.  The spells and skill selection hasn't changed much (if at all) which is also disappointing.Combat is action oriented hack and slash where your skill with the keyboard (or controller) is more important than your character stats.  As everything you face will be tailored to your level you will, for the most part, never find anything too hard or too easy if you approach the encounter right..  Honestly, I think my characters skill with a bow should be more important than my skill of aiming the bow for him.  While it's a standard for action RPG's it lessens character development.You will find tho that making a character to your play style will be pretty easy.  The balance and difference between various play styles is well done and feel quite different for the most part, requiring different strategies for encounters.  Mages, warriors, rogues, and rogue-mages, and warrior mages all feel independent of each other. This is perhaps the highlight of the game mechanics.The biggest disappointment of this game is Bethesda's promise of certain things that they failed to achieve.  One was the ""alieness"" you felt in Morrowind.  They promised players would feel like a stranger in a strange land with Skyrim, much like the unique presentation of Morrowind which was lost with the generic setting of Oblivion.  Skyrim has no such sense of being unique in any way.  It's more or less like one would expect an RPG set in snowy mountain regions with nordic influence.Skyrim is a fine game.  It's fun to play and it's vast.  There is lots to look at and do.  But it's not perfect.  It's certainly better than most other open world RPG's (Gothic 3 & 4, Risen) but then so are Morrowind and Oblivion to this day.  Sadly, Skyrim fails to take what Morrowind and Oblivion games us to the next level.  It just gives us more of the same but with a worse interface.",drachehexe

Meanwhile, for Persona 5, it got me in the first hour of gameplay. I am constantly surprised by how the story is planned out, in a good way. Only thing is that I don't feel the strong bond as I did in Persona 4 yet. But it will get there after more time playing the game.Character designs are out of this world. I love the artwork of every single character in the game. I hope they keep this kind of artwork style forever for the series.The music and graphics are amazing, and work very well together. For those comments regarding graphics being like 10 years out of date, I am wondering where they can find such good graphics 10 years ago... I honestly dislike all the debate on the frame rate, etc. As long as the game graphics look good and enjoyable to the player, there is no reason to care about such things.Battle systems are like Persona 3 and 4 with little to no new elements. This is probably the only complaint I had.Last but not least, I do feel there is not a lot of change from Persona 3 and 4 in terms of entire game structure. HOWEVER, that is the least of my concern. I want to relax and enjoy the game, not to constantly look for ""new"" things. When the game gets bored, then it is a problem and requires update. So far, I don't feel that way at all.Overall, this is a wonderful game. For any JRPG fan, or someone who just wants to read a good story, Persona 5 is a must buy.",LightOTTBeat

Good job, you tried to improve graphics that were already working, now the clips have bugs and the game is so huge it eats a lot of space from my laptop's hard drive. Combat had already got so boring I lowered the difficulty before I started multiplayer and story.Onto the multiplayer. Such golden promises, a lot of expectation from people and... ta-da! They ""created"" what's been created in numerous games before. Repetetive, dull multiplayer that's seen after you play a single round of it. It has no chat besides voice, and personally as a female gamer I'd hate to talk to strangers, knowing how it has ended up many times. And what about people that aren't really into shooters and come from the RPG side, or without a microphone? The only drive to keep playing it is unlocking new weapons and characters and the playing itself reminds me of a Disney made childrens game that at some point has a shooter mini-game. If I want to play a shooter game with no ""goal"" or purpose, I'd rather pick something like Left for Dead 2 or Bulletstorm, or hell even Call of Duty: MW. With real kick-ass weapons.What the ****, Bioware? I can't romance James Vega? I went to Mass Effect Wiki because I was curious about the romances. For my utter defeat, I found I cannot romance the (in my personal opinion) hottest character in the ME universe so far. I even signed a petition, a petition, to get a DLC for a possible romance. Which would also be the only DLC I'd ever consider buying for the game. Note, consider. I do not dig aliens. I do not dig whimps. Even though, I have to give it to Kaidan, he's manned up. Did I already mention I do not dig aliens? I wish I hadn't picked any romance in the game, but how was I supposed to know it'd just be 1 man, 1 alien and lesbians in the end. In my opinion the lesbians are there to sell the game more anyway. Personally I really don't like it that my assistant in both previous games has been after my character's bum.Besides that, I never finished the game. I played it for a good couple of hours and decided I'm not putting up with having to play multiplayer that murders my brain for a better ending. The story felt like an on-going drag that I just wanted to stop looking at even with my short play time. Much things didn't make any sense. And I was also disappointed I seriously cannot romance Mr.Vega.There's been a lot of complaints that the ending is very bad. I probably won't make it there, seeing that it was difficult to motivate myself to finish ME2 either. I shall be glad.I can very shortly analyze the reasons I would push myself to play it. 1) I could live in hope to beat Illusive Man, 2) Wrex is splendid, 3) James Vega.No expectations, no disappointment. I wasn't expecting the game unlike many people I know, which most likely makes me a lot less disappointed in Bioware and the stupid game. I was more disappointed in Dragon Age 2, which was a joke.",Scarlet

Magazines and sites post compareable ratings to games that go on to win awards and golden joysticks which I must say is incredibly irresponsible of them when customers buy their publications to read their reviews.Firstly I'll cover the cons of FIFA and I'm sad to say that this list is longer than the pros.- Pacing and Crossing MechanicsSimply... crossing and heading/volleying is far to easy, you can take apart the highest difficulty of opponent by multiple goals if you can break and cross to your strikers.  It doesn't matter so much about the defender's AI (though it can help) it's just the fact that headers go in most of the time even when they are close to the keeper and would be realistically saveable.-Bugs and Freezes and Career Mode woesOne of my favourite modes has always been Career Mode and it's sad to see that FIFA (perhaps deliberately) are letting it stale.  I really don't care about Ultimate Team, I'd much rather play as my favourite League Two team and get promoted all the way to the heights of the Premier League.Firstly is the ridiculous retire rate of players which quite frankly can wreck teams when one of your best players decides to quit at the age of 29.  As an example I bought Marvin Emnes when my team were promoted to the Championship and he retired a season later at 29... realistic no? XDThe game freezes in Career, moreso than in other modes which can be a pain when it does it before an autosave.-EA Server InstabilityJust annoying to be honest, even to a point that I had to change passwords in order to access FIFA online (whilst every other game I had still worked).  The EA Football Club also decides it randomly wants to disconnect when every other online game I play is fine.-EA Support/CommunityThey are well known for being terrible and with FIFA it seems the case once again with countless problems being ignored on the forums and I know a few frustrated customers who are swearing off buying another FIFA game on this gen of console.ProsGameplay -Under the bugs there is a competent football game which is enjoyable to play especially in parties of friends.  The pacing and movement is better than 13 with improvements to the defensive controls which were irritating on 13 for me personally.Besides the easy crosses most other aspects seem to be well balanced with the ability to be able to take on players and play to the touchline (something you could do on PES with great ease for many years until FIFA noticed how clunky their control was).On balance this review is based on measuring FIFA against other franchises and companies sports games and many, many, many offer much more depth and less buggy problems.

6025,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Switch,6,"As a Zelda fan that has played almost every Zelda game there is, I have to say that this is undoubtebly the worst entry in the franchise (yet).This game is a mix of a completely dumbed-down Zelda game and a completely dumbed down open world RPG like the Witcher 3. What made the previous titles so fun to play, the varied dungeons, items, music, side quests, combat mechanics are all goneAs a Zelda fan that has played almost every Zelda game there is, I have to say that this is undoubtebly the worst entry in the franchise (yet).This game is a mix of a completely dumbed-down Zelda game and a completely dumbed down open world RPG like the Witcher 3. What made the previous titles so fun to play, the varied dungeons, items, music, side quests, combat mechanics are all gone or wattered down and have been replaced by tedious features like cooking, running for hours and hours and killing the same stupid ennemies to get weapons, not because they are better and more complex to use, but because your previous ones break. The fact that you have no direction means nothing, as there is no point in doing anything, you just get some more effective weapons, clothes and food, that's all, the ennemies are all the same and are all set up in the same camps over and over, good open world games normally have a tonn of varied quests, lots of ennemies and characters, meaningful character customization (so the opposite of this game) and a much more interactive world than this game. The Witcher 3 really showed what the genre is capable of. Zelda games are set in the action-adventure genre, but this time the action is dumbed down and repetive, the adventure is worthless since you will already have discovered most of the stuff in the plateau area. I really miss the old Zelda dungeons where you got very interesting items wich resulted in a very interesting gameplay, looking back at the people complaining that Skyward Sword was too linear and didn't have enough stuff to explore, I think it would have been much better if it stayed that way. If only this game would serve as an example of what Nintendo shouldn't do with Zelda, but seeing the metascore of 98 makes me think that this is the end for the Zelda series, atleast if you liked the interesing gameplay of the predecessors.",Halyo

Rather it would have been if I hadn’t sunk a relatively large amount of time in clinging to the hope it would get better.I think everyone, especially fans of the earlier games, will be extremely disappointed in Fallout 4. Most of the elements that made Fallout unique have either been stripped out, dumbed down, or completely removed. In exchange we now have a moderately interesting but mostly frustrating to use village simulator. That's right, you can now construct mini towns for completely lifeless and uninteresting AI! It seems as though the development time spent on this particular feature was sorely needed elsewhere. Gun customization is a nice touch but generally boils down to adding a few different preset mods to a limited number of base weapons and armor.One of the other new features is the conversation system. I think there are implementations of it that could work but generally it just feels wrong in the context of Fallout. Additionally, as other users have reported many choices seem to lead to the same outcome. Being a jerk, sometimes even outright refusing options will have the same result as choices like “Let’s do it!”. Furthering the feeling of choices not making a difference, there are other well discussed issues such as invincible NPCs and commonly being denied the ability to do things that you could in past games.Combat feels slightly improved compared to past Bethesda entries in the Fallout series but overall doesn’t do any one thing particularly well. There’s no concept of cover and gun play generally involves pointing and clicking while you strafe. That wouldn’t be the worst thing ever if shooting felt as tight as something like Counter-Strike. Unfortunately, the default settings like mouse acceleration, smoothing, and other issues like extreme frame dips make your standard point and click with a mouse much less satisfying. Sneaking is present but extremely basic. It certainly won’t make you feel like Venom in MGSV. VATS is unique but essentially only exists as a brief moment of auto-aim that provides relief for the otherwise sub-par shooting experience.Another disappointing area but not totally unexpected is Fallout 4’s graphics. I don’t believe they’re quite as terrible as some of the 0/10s would have you believe but they definitely aren’t what you would expect out of a “AAA” title. I would suggest making judgement on this area yourself through YouTube videos, screenshots, etc.I won’t touch too much on the story because it can largely be affect by things like exploration, side questions, and other factors. For the most part, if you’re expecting something along the lines of The Witcher you will likely be disappointed.Finally, In typical Bethesda fashion the game suffers from a range of issues including crashing to desktop, models randomly disappearing, getting stuck after using terminals, and only being able to hear NPCs talk when you are facing 180 degrees away from them. Browsing online it’s clear I’m not the only experiencing these issues. Rather I seem to among the more fortunate who haven’t run into anything game breaking yet. Some people don’t think these bugs should be factored into the score because they will be fixed eventually. However, these bugs did affect my overall enjoyment of the game in more than a marginal way.Overall Fallout 4 was a mostly mediocre experience that probably would have been great as a $40 game not associated with the Fallout franchise. However, being that it was a $60 dollar game and it was a part of the Fallout franchise I simply can’t recommend anyone buy this game for anything more than $40. It may not be a terrible game, but in the context of “Fallout” games it’s well below average.",aervans

Don't think you'll be seeing anything like what's in the trailers.

Several. Years. Same game. Same old game. A couple new units, a couple new tech, but most of the units (90%) are copied and pasted from SOASE.So I'm really curious as to why people like this game. I played the original flavor, and maybe thought it wasn't a waste of $30, but I didn't play it much since it was very rough around the edges, and I was more accustomed to games like Company of Heroes and Civilization which were polished, fun, and well produced.

'Rebellion' is a waste of money, a useless game, a joke, a trick to steal your hard earned money in exchange for an old game with a new name which was mediocre to begin with.What I'm trying to say is: DO NOT buy this $10 expansion for $40. This is an expansion to an existing game being sold as a stand-alone game. There is no option to buy it as an expansion, even though 90% of the game is from the original SOASE.

It starts out very basic and let's you get a sense of how to move and shoot in combat. Then, as you begin to unlock character abilities, the depth grows, and the difficulty increases at a near perfect pace.The Mario and Rabbids mashup is just so charming. I love both of these IPs and to see them brought together in such a nostalgic and thoughtful way is wonderful. Another element that I want to touch on is the fact that my girlfriend is enjoying the game every bit as much as I am. We're sort of in a competition to see who can finish first. We've had it since Tuesday, it is now Saturday, and we both have nearly 30 hours in. I want to stress how uncommon it is for mainstream video games to truly cater to both a male and female audience. Nintendo does this better and with more titles than any of its competitors, and that's important to me, because it shouldn't just be us guys that are catered to through this beautiful, immersive art form that is gaming.For those that are finding the game difficult in later levels. I can tell you that if you fail a fight, take the time to really analyze how it played out and adjust your team accordingly, you'll be just fine. Look for those synergies that exist between different characters. Look at how the enemies group themselves and move. Rabbid Yoshi and Rabbid Mario's ability to force opponents to move, for example, works tremendously with Mario and Luigi's ""Shoot on movement"" abilities. I'm on level 3-8 now, and I've  definitely lost a couple of fights, and restarted quite a few more to make adjustments, but i've never once felt like I didn't know what to do to overcome one of the fights once I had seen it and really thought through the combat.The only reason I didn't give this game a 10/10 is because in the free-roam areas, movement can be a little wonky maneuvering around blocks and such. This becomes a bit frustrating when doing timed puzzles. But, it's far from game-breaking. I have never needed more than a few tries to get through any of the puzzles. Also, there are some ""nice to haves"" that aren't there. Like being able to see: if I move to this space, where will my weapon be able to reach"" before you move.Overall, this game is so well done. And, there absolutely is variety in enemy types, map setups, and strategies. Sometimes they'll throw an easy fight at you just to introduce a new type of enemy before you face them grouped with other types in a tougher fight.I can't recommend this game enough to anyone who owns a Switch. Like I said, I was never a fan of tactical shooters, but not only do I love this game, I feel like it helped me to better understand the mechanics of a tactical shooter. Once I finish it, I might just go install XCOM again and give it another go. Who knows, i might just end up loving it.",mds27272

You've heard the story about how that component was farmed out to the dipsticks that make the halo multiplayer, and it shows: it's halo with doom-flavoredI'll be honest. I was scared for Doom at first. I had a formulaic and hilariously terrible gameplay experience in the closed and open multiplayer betas, and I continued to have that same **** experience in the multiplayer after release. You've heard the story about how that component was farmed out to the dipsticks that make the halo multiplayer, and it shows: it's halo with doom-flavored window dressing. But the moment the game launched, I heard nothing but good things about the campaign. I watched the Game Grumps play it, tried the demo, and got the game for myself in the recent Steam summer sale.The glowing reviews don't even do this game justice. Doom 4 is the perfect unholy marriage of everything that was once good in 90s FPS with what little is nice about modern ones, and its success is both a testament to the quality of that subgenre and a slap in the face to the military shooter I hope it will feel for some years to come. Channeling the first two Dooms with a vengeance, Doom 4 hurls you headlong into the action immediately, with brisk movement speed, no cover, no regenerating health, double jumping (eventually), no reloading, armor pickups, secret areas, powerups, the ability to carry every weapon at once and, if you're a stickler about that kind of thing, no cutscenes. It blends these with the amazing visuals you'd expect from ID's in-house engines and the modern mercy of the objective waypoint, sparing me from those long, agonizing hours of my youth spent blundering about Doom 2's infuriating mazes. New to the series also are alternate fire modes for your weapons, which replace the bland and boring iron-sight gameplay of modern FPS with Unreal Tournament-style combat options, with upgrades for these alt fire modes and ""demon rune"" perks that both are earned by and help you do more of the Doomy things you'd already be doing- shooting, rip and/or tearing, and finding secrets. I have heard absolute Doom purists complain about these upgrades, but I find them an enriching addition.On that note, I must speak to the signature mechanic of the game: the glory kills. It was originally feared that these too fundamentally altered and broke up the signature gameplay of Doom, but I view it from a different angle. They are the icing on a new kind of murder cake that this game has created, and I hope other games will follow its example. This Doom is not just a sequel to Doom 1 and 2, spiritually if not directly. It is the culmination and acknowledgement of the memetic evolution of Doom and it's nameless protagonist, including the infamous Brutal Doom mod. The achievements reference everything from classic cheat codes to the doom comic to the ""shoot it until it dies"" protip, and the phrase ""rip and tear"" is even used in-game. This is the story of Doomguy as the legend he has become, a berserker-packing man-and-a-half who can literally rip demons in twain with his bare hands and just happens to like power armor, guns and chainsaws because they make his job easier. There is just enough plot and lore entries to reinforce this idea, telling a story of a lone champion's eternal vengeance.The fact that glory kills reward you with health does indeed make the game easier, but that's because the game would be a lot harder if you didn't get health that way. You need to move fast because the demons are numerous and aggressive, and you need to carry all the guns because you actually need that much firepower to tackle everything hell throws your way. You need that armor to survive a few seconds longer, you need those upgrades and runes to give you an edge to offset the demons' numerical advantage... it all creates this gameplay loop that works incredibly smoothly. I enjoyed every moment of the campaign from beginning to end: the fights, the jumps, the secrets, and the plot, which through limited character interaction is very effective at what it does. I only hope that there are campaign add-ons in the future.With the multiplayer as disappointing as it is, with it's stupidly low time-to-kill ratio and various trappings of the CoD/Nexon/Overwatch genre of shooter, such as instant kills, weird hitboxes and total lack of rocket jumping, I thought my experience with Doom ended when the credits rolled after the campaign. The true surprise then, was the Snapmap mode: A built-in editor that allows you to create your own maps for deathmatches as well as solo or cooperative play, using pre-made room segments to create your own maps, and items, weapons, enemies, AI directors, environmental triggers and other bits that allow you to develop your own gameplay within the confines of the game's assets. It's no true set of mod tools and obviously pales in comparison to what is possible and has been done with classic Doom and Quake, but there is some surprising depth in Snapmap and is worth a look. Importantly, it means there is a form of coop in a game that would otherwise have none.",Captain_Chaos

Unfortunately Valve has gone with the popular notion that a game can be carried by it's multiplayer component. NOW this can be true for FPSes like BC2, but a game like Portal where puzzle platforming is core gameplay does not hold to this principle. Now that being said. The game itself was a good, great voice acting too. Although the quality is somewhat lacking compared to the original, it seems more like an homage to the first Portal rather than a sequel. As for the score, I would've given it a 8 or a 9 if not for the blatant marketing ploys.

Dicho esto, paso a valorar el juego.Esta valoración esta solo enfocada al modo campaña, no toco el multijugador.La historia y los acontecimientos en el juego son interesantes y bastante variados, dejando interés a lo largo de toda la partida por mucho que la mayoría de facciones ya no os planten cara. Orcos salvajes, tribus, Caos... sin duda son variados y dan guerra. Añadir que no tengo mucho conocimiento del Universo Warhammer (lo poco que conozco es por los juegos relacionados que he jugado, y por pequeñas cosas que he leido), asi que no puedo valorar este apartado desde un punto de vista rolero, solo jugabilitico.Las facciones por fin son mínimamente variadas entre ellas, ya no en aspecto solo, si no en forma de juego. Por ejemplo, el amor por la guerra y la sed de sangre Orca se traslada muy bien al juego. Una de las cosas en este tema de las que más he oído discutir es el sistema de conquista, ya que las distintas facciones no pueden conquistar todo el mapa por sus afinidades con el entorno y demás. Mucha gente lo odia y a un pequeño grupo le gusta, yo soy de los segundos por que me encanta la estrategia que otorga esto, ya que al no poder conquistar todo, tienes que pensar por que zonas puedes moverse de una manera más correcta para poder ganar una guerra con un enemigo que este lejos.En cuanto a gráficos ya sabéis que esta saga siempre ha destacado. Animaciones, mapa, variedad en las animaciones...Sin duda yo lo recomiendo para todos los amantes de Warhammer y Total War, hacia tiempo que no me lo pasaba tan bien con un juego de esta saga.",Laer

Every minute building on the amazing story that ended in the first episode. Through out ep2 there were more intense moments like the elevator event in ep1. Now I join the long list of people who really love Half-Life and are waiting for Episode 3 or Half-Life 3. Maybe some day soon we can get to the end of the story with the trusty crowbar. I did run into a few sound problems of mostly sounds playing in a loop when they shoulden't.

However, PC gamers cannot properly enjoy the new particle effects featured by the DirectX10 support without encountering major stability issues.  Therefore, the graphical improvements made from Bioshock 1 are rather incremental.  Both games both share the same audio problems and issues with the mouse sensitivity and controls.  However, as long as you know what files to open and which values to change, the crazy mouse sensitivity and skipping sound should plague you no more than it did in Bioshock 1.  This sequel did not take the franchise in a new direction the way Mass Effect 2 or System Shock 2 did.  However, much like God of War 2, Bioshock 2 had a nearly perfect prequel.  As a result, they took an already winning recipe of extraordinary level design and phenomenal combat, and cleverly refined and modified this formula into another incredible experience in Rapture.  Bioshock 2 delivers a less memorable experience, but certainly not an all-around worse experience.  This sequel takes place 10 years after the events of Bioshock 1 and places the player in the glorified fish tank of Rapture.  Evolution has taken its toll on this underwater utopia, and has become a darker and creeper place with incredibly impressive aesthetics.  Bioshock 2 handles moral choice and its consequences incredibly better than the first game.  It focuses more on personal confrontations and less on the philosophy behind Rapture.  The ending is much more meaningful and emotionally overwhelming as the repercussions of your choices unfold into an incredibly satisfying conclusion.  The secondary goals of finding and defending Adam stuffed corpses offers incredibly rewarding challenges.  In addition, Bioshock 2 features new and overwhelmingly powerful enemies that keep the gameplay fresh.  Exploring the underwater skyscrapers in Rapture has never been this much fun.",ChrisOzzie

The year was 2008, and all I wanted for my birthday was one game, a game that had just come out in November, a game I had specifically showed my mother to get, Kirby Super Star Ultra. I woke up early the morning of my birthday, saw a gift that was in the shape of a DS game case, and hastily I tore away the gift wrapping. Inside, wasn't the game I had picked out. Instead, it was Chrono Trigger. In my mind, this was the best mistake my mom had made since I was conceived.Everything about Chrono Trigger is outstanding. The beginning opening with the festival is an example that shows most of what I mean. It teaches you about core game mechanics without seeming like a tutorial, it subtly constructs the world and the plot through every action you take, it endears the player to Marle which ensures that the player has a personal motivation for acting rather than just being told, ""that's what your character would do,"" and does this all while being a lighthearted romp in a festival. It ensures that you feel invested before the story starts, and that once the story does start you will be ready. Furthermore, the hidden ramifications of your actions at the festival, and having no characters forcing Crono to do anything,  highlight the influence that personal choices have in the narrative. The game is a seamless blend between the overarching plot and every action you take. Every main quest, every side quest, and every character decision is all part of accomplishing your main objective in the game. The characters all have distinctive personalities and unique movesets that mesh differently with everyone else, encouraging you to play with everyone, and endearing you to everyone.I could ramble on and on, but seeing all the other reviews it's unnecessary at this point. To summarize, Chrono Trigger is by far, the best JRPG, if not the best RPG, I've ever played.",danmfg

I couldn't get past the third boss for how mind numbingly boring it was, and how the morality ""system"" is so utterly  and insanely broken and flawed, that I just couldn't keep playing. It's definitely one of those games where you either love it or hate it. Guess which side I am?But first things first: if people love this game there must be reasons and there ARE reasons: the writing is top notch, the music is BRILLIANT and SUPERB (seriously, I hate the game but I constantly listen to its music) and the gameplay is varied and enjoyable (I guess?). The game is story based and so you'll end up following it in order to finish it, rather than playing it for the gameplay. If I have to pick a real flaw it would be its length: you can finish it the first time in about 6 hours...but it's one of those games that forces you to restart at least once in order to get the true ending, ""because that's good development sign""Jokes aside, I honestly have no issue with its technical aspect: it's fantastic, and it has no real issues with almost anything...but then why do I hate this game so much?It's simple: the game itself is, in a very general way of speaking, a ""teaching game"" of how ""killing is bad"" and ""doing the right thing is good"" and that's a very rough way of describing it. There is more to it, but the game will essentially punish you for doing any evil things and reward you for doing good things. There is a neutral ending, yes, but it's still the same thing.I'm sorry, I heard this game was supposed to be SO advanced in terms of morality, but all I'm seeing is a dumbed down version of Mass Effect all of those morality system we have so far: I really don't feel invested on being good or evil, because being evil automatically locks you from the good ending WITHOUT ANY WAYS OF REDEEMING YOURSELF. In addition, I found the characters extremely annoying and hard to care about, I wished I could kill them...but if I kill even one of them, I get the bad ending so what's the point?And that's also sad because the fighting is actually good: everytime you get to fight, you have the chance to avoid incoming damage by actually avoiding the enemy attacks, which is a great thing! However, if you decide to go for pacifist, you won't gain exp and levels and will be stuck at lvl 1...i-isn't that so much fun? y-y-y-yay...yay....But I understand all of this: the game is all about to be rewarded for doing the good things, and being punished for the bad things...but I'm sorry we all know that this is not true: sometimes you have to act bad for achieving the good, and being good will often lead you ""to the bad ending"". That's not a theory: it's a life fact, it's a thing that happens all the time and that's why this game really bothers me.Plus, I don't need a game to tell me that killing is bad and Undertale, on this part, was treating me like an idiot.So despite the rant, I highly recommend this game...because it's good, it's NOT FOR ME but I can see why it's good for many others: it's detailed, it's filled with passion and has nothing terrible going on. But it might or might not bother you about its message and story parts, which really discouraged me to get through the true ending and because I honestly didn't care a single bit about its character: they were boring, and if I tried to act differently than ""goodie goodie"", I'd get a slap for being ""evily evil"".On this morality regard, I just played better games...and overall, better rpgs.",vahn
