251606,Mario Kart Wii,Wii,7,"This is definitely the pinnacle of  the Mario Kart series and the best game for Wii, thanks to the highly satisfying online mode which CAN provide countless hours of replay value. HOWEVER, this enjoyment is hampered considerably due to the ever increasing amount of cheaters using hacked consoles to give themselves constant invincibility, infinite blue shells and other unfair advantages.This is definitely the pinnacle of  the Mario Kart series and the best game for Wii, thanks to the highly satisfying online mode which CAN provide countless hours of replay value. HOWEVER, this enjoyment is hampered considerably due to the ever increasing amount of cheaters using hacked consoles to give themselves constant invincibility, infinite blue shells and other unfair advantages. For every 10 games played online, I would estimate you will encounter at LEAST 3 or 4 games with such cheaters. This was not a frequent occurrence when the game was initially released, but over time, and with Nintendo's proven unwillingness to address the issue, it has become a common annoyance which ruins the experience.Aside from the online play, the addition of motorbikes is the most visible addition to the series, and have become quite popular since, more often than not, they are faster than the karts the game is named for. Regardless, the choice between the two vehicle types adds nice variety and good challenge for the underdogs using the classic go karts.Lastly I should mention that while there are about 20 tracks, several of these are from previous games in the series making things seem not so original. A couple extra new courses would have gone a long way to keep things from getting stale over time.Apart from these issues, the game offers an exciting racing experience which everyone can enjoy. The question however is ""for how long?""",MentalVortex

I've played the other souls games, but they always give you the ability to level up from the get go. This ensured that whilst you are settling in, and dying a lot (and in the process getting better at the game), that you do not feel like you're completely wasting your time. Bloodborne however insists that you learn before you can play the game. Some people love this, I wasn't a fan, and I think it was Bloodbornes only misstep.I've loved the previous games in the series but they always felt a little clunky and slow, even when rolling an agile build they don't really compare to the speed at which bloodborne plays. This is the best thing about the game. Inherently it is another souls game with a mysterious story, challenging combat and big boss fights, but dropping the shield and upping the aggression level means the game feels fresh.The world itself is stunning and the detail in which it's been realised is quite frankly staggering. Whilst the levels never truly open out to any great degree they are interconnected in wonderfully elaborate way. Souls games have always got a great sense of discovery about them, the lack of handholding and the difficulty in accessing some areas gives you a real sense of accomplishment and wonder when you do find a new area or shortcut.The game is a meaty one and took me a good 27 hours on my first play through, and this was without touching the chalice dungeons. Others will progress quicker and others slower, but I don't think anyone will complain about the games length. Some of the bosses are somewhat simple in the vanilla run through (only becoming challenging in NG+), some areas aren't as well designed as others with the Nightmare frontier being a rather dull area when compared to the rest of the world, but it's such a small fraction of what's on offer it does little to diminish the whole.Bloodborne streamlines the equipment side of things and whilst the weapon list is substantially shorter the weapons themselves are far more distinct from each other than they've been before. No longer are there 20 different variations on a long sword, they're still 3-4 but they all have substantially different secondary modes. Armour is no longer a matter of getting the best, you start with good armour and whilst there are some higher stat armour sets out there it is usually about finding the best for a situation rather than a defacto power set.For those who've played dark souls, think a quicker, more focused, more brutal game. For those who haven't, despite some early annoyances, the game is quite frankly one of the best I've ever played, it won't be for everyone, some won't have the patience, others don't have the time, but for those who do you will be rewarded with a very special game that leaves you wondering how the next souls game could be any better?",OllyNorton

Sadly WoW has a more competitive combat system. The combo system was an amazing concept however they did NOT deliver on it. The combo system isn't as much a combo system, but a self pressed auto attack. For a combo system to be effective it needs to require some reaction time...sadly AoC's combat system requires none. Honestly though even a mess up on the combo system can be overlooked assuming the other aspects of PvP are good. This is just not the case with AoC. I can't begin to understand why the game developers decided that moving around in PvP was something to not focus on. Anyone who is serious when it comes to PvP can tell you that movement, and positioning requires more involvement from the player which in turn makes the PvP more in depth. Any PvP that requires you to stand still to be at all effective is sad. Yes you can move in AoC, but it is laughable at best. So if you're looking for no-skill click fest when it comes to PvP combat AoC is pretty promising. Now what about the other aspects of the game? Well for starters the graphics are absolutely amazing in some areas while terribly bland in others. For example the cities are amazing in design and in looks. but some of the outside areas are better suited for 2D Models. Now the world PvP is a gank fest on a PvP server which is something I've always found exciting. However whoever thought of the graveyard idea had to be an idiot. Take a PvP combat system that requires no skill and have everyone spawn at a few choice graveyards placed in an area and you have a nubfest. People like me can grief a person forcing them to exit the game and come back another time. When you die you can choose different graveyards assuming you've explored an area. Seeing as how I grief most people when they're stuck loading into the zone they really aren't given a choice as to which graveyard to choose. Upon resurrecting they have half life and can only resurrect in one place... Yeh that system cant be abused at all... Anyways thats my perspective on just the PvP aspect. Sadly this game did not deliver and I was desperately hoping for it be a great game. Sorry to those who enjoy this game but I cant go along with the hype.",ChadF

If you think cooking should be quick and easy to prepare before battle well that's not this game.  Maybe in the Witcher you can instantly fill up everything you know the recipe for but in Zelda you need to spend 30 min crafting each individual meal waiting through the 10 second jingle to finish after every one.    This annoyance continues through the whole game... you'll need to sit through 5 loading screens to finish each shrine and most of the time they aren't even worth it. Shines are generally just very simple puzzles with no visual difference and they pale in comparison to open world puzzles used to unlock shrines.

It has aspects of Call of Duty, Halo, Counter-Strike, and Tribes... it's still early(content wise), but it's an amazing change in the FPS genre.The story is non-existing(who plays a FPS for the story?).. but the genre is a nice modern/sci-fi setting, which really bring out the best in the modern war shooter as well as hitting the science fiction aspect with the Titanfall's.The mechanics of every building being scalable(sp?) is one of the greatest addition to FPS mechanics in a very long time.  After letting my roommate play, I watched and realized that habit(for everyone playing) is to stay on the ground like traditional FPS, but as you start to take advantage of the ability to climb any building, it gives a serious Tribes feel... the entire map is your playground.People have complained about the repetitive nature.... Have you played ANY other FPS?  Every FPS I have ever played.. ever.The game is repetitive yes, but no different than any other FPS out there.  Hop in a lobby, play a map you've played before, kill people.  Titanfall is neither a positive or negative in this aspect... it's done nothing in my opinion to differentiate from the repetitive nature of other shooters, but it isn't any different than COD or Halo in this aspect.Ultimately, the game is a fast pace shooter(fastest COD out there imo)... it has different game mechanics which make it unique(scaling any building, the Titanfalls themselves).The game is not for everyone, but here's the type that I think will and will not enjoy it:Will:Call of Duty players(Not the die-hards that live, eat, and breath anything that Activision throws at them, you'll never win the fan boys)Counter-Strike players-  As a former CS player that has played several other shooters but hasn't really been hooked on any of them), this is the closest I've come to that hooked feeling.  True fast paced, shoot and kill gameplay.Won't:Battlefield players-  While I enjoy the BF series, it's a strategic shooter that has an emphasis on teamplay, this game is a run and gun where you can have success with or without your team.COD Fanboys- There are people that feel like enjoying this game is a slight against COD in some way and it's amusing but ridiculous.So I give it a 9 out of 10.  If you enjoy fast paced shooters, you'll love this.  Plain an simple.  It's a return to the twitch based shooter.  It's definitely the most fun I've had playing an FPS in recent memory.",jrydun

I can't even understand why i need two cds: The first cd has only the campaign, that it's epic but it lasts so much as a kid's popsicle on a hot day in the middle of the beach. Then you have Spartan Ops and Multiplayer, both of them requires you to install the cd 2 before you start to play. Why i need to install cd 2 ( that creates a file of more than 4 GB on the hard drive) to play Spartan Ops and Multiplayer ? Spartan Ops is only 1 f#cking episode, it's boring and it's impossible to play it offline so if you're not a gold member Microsoft f#cks you in the @ss. Then you have multiplayer, where you are allowed to choose between... what ?... 3 maps on the big modes - not even a half of what we had on Halo 3! The graphics are good, clearly not the best but in the top 5 of the console for sure. The scenarios are big and high detailed. I played sick battles on them with no frame-rate issues whatsoever. The ""level up"" system is unfair because it rewards the people who bought the game earlier than others, the sickest weapons and habilities will always be available exclusive to players with high rank level (but still a mile away better than any COD multiplayer). The game also doesn't have any punishment for friendly fire and that sometimes can be very frustrating. There are various modes for multiplayer and almost nothing for the campaign: skulls without points and some ""movie only"" chapters to give you the impression that the campaign was satisfactory: it wasn't. The history is incredible weak, to be fair it would be almost childish if wasn't for Cortana's drama. Unfortunately, it's not a journey because Halo 4's campaign is not long enough for the player to feel connected with the characters and the events. The motion capture doesn't add too much. The soundtrack is good but not even close of being excelent as the soundtrack from the original trilogy.

Talking about puzzles in Gone Home means that the game challenges you to puzzle out its characters through the things you find in the house. You learn all these little details about the Greenbriar family by finding their belongings, investigating them and drawing your own conclusions as to what they might mean. Remember the Ratman hideouts in Portal and your thought process as you tried to figure out what might have happened there? Gone Home has a ton of these little moments of environmental storytelling, but instead of an abandoned sci-fi research facility, it takes place in a setting you know, that you can completely relate to. There was one moment in particular that involved the father of the house who we never see or hear but through several notes and clues I found I was able to understand his inner struggles and his character better than I would ever have any other way. It was a proper 'holy crap' moment and it was glorious. This is why Gone Home is very much a game. It doesn't have the traditional gamey challenges you might expect, but instead sets out to challenge you in very different and new ways and in my humble opinion brilliantly pulls it off. This kind of storytelling is simply impossible in any other medium.It is short at about 2 to 3 hours of playtime and it's understandable that at the current price point that may not be enough for a lot of people but I think it's well worth it. It's an experience unlike anything else and at least for that it should be appreciated even it isn't you cup of tea.",JuanRegular

But then you'll begin to think that perhaps Sony built this game around the absolute bombastic opening moments and the rest of the title be damned.You would be wrong, you would be so wrong.The content you get in those opening moments is just the tip of the iceberg. Underneath that opening is a masterful weaving of plot, storytelling, character development, and some of the best combat in a long time.The visuals are stunning at the base--factor in HDR and 4K and the movie-quality levels of camera angles and shots and you'll find your jaw dropping more often than not. The music is so pinpoint perfect in the package that I legitimately want to watch the making of the game to get a better insight into just how they went about making this game.The dispassionate Kratos was by far the absolute best touch. If you've finished God of War 3, this Kratos is the drained of all that rage and anger just from beating Zeus to a bloody pulp. Arteus is the perfect summation of that anger and rage and the need to temper it in a package.God of War is just one of those titles that come along and all the stars align. I could nitpick about things like how I wish the camera might have been just a touch further out during combat or perhaps if they gave the player more options in regards to button mapping, but they are so small that it really doesn't affect the overall package.This game is a masterpiece. I have a rule about not giving any game an absolute score (10 or 0) because there is no such thing as perfection, but God of War gets the highest mark I will give. This title is something that would be taught in school for people creating and designing video games.Update* 5/30-I decided on knocking off a point due to the obnoxious amounts of grind-padding towards the end of the game. GOW has always been known for the amount of collecting it has (power-ups for weapons or health etc...) but the sheer worthless amounts of it towards the end game is a downer. Pace-shattering padding and it wasn't really necessary. Most of the gear nominally makes you more powerful, but beyond tacking Muselphiem early (which I did) the rest of the ""gear"" isn't all that wonderful.Niefhiem is a god awful idea as is grinding out the ""Best gear in the game"" (It barely is). Nor is it worth doing the maze over and over and OVER to max it out. Sigun--the hardest boss in the game..I was able to do it with zero upgrades to the set (I was level 8) and did it on normal.My point here is this: Don't waste your time with the grinding, it breaks the pacing of the story, the relationship with Kratos and his ""boy"" and adds so very little to the overarching narrative. Hit the power threshold you need to complete it and move on, the rest adds nothing.Also, a minor point for me to raise. To the dev that designed the Winds of Hel: I don't like you very much. If you are the same person that also designed the first escape from Helheim and that spot on the bridge (YOU KNOW WHICH ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT!); someone needs to sit you down and ask you why you like hurting people so much.",Goo4you

My PC crashed within 2 minutes of track time on Ultra, which doesn't happen after 2 hours on BF3 on High! Anyway, the only graphical difference between the 360 version and PC is the more consistent environmental textures. Cars look no different really, apart from more reflections. The green tint can be annoying as well. However, that's the only downside to this game. Achievements are good, career is of perfect length and variety and multiplayer is even more rewarding than DiRT 2, and more balanced and polished. This really is an ultimate package. I'm glad that there is now full controller support for PC. You can navigate menus easily and most controllers will work with the game. This is a racing game for everyone. There is rally, rallycross, gymkhana, hillclimb, one-on-one crossovers and landrush. You really can't go wrong. There are now assists so you can cater the experience to suit you. Vehicle set-ups are simplified like in DiRT 2 but now the game will automatically choose the optimal even if you don't change anything. Only gear ratios are constant, but they're more personal preference. Anyway, apart from the inefficient and taxing EGO 2.0 game engine, which quite evidently isn't very good given how demanding games like this, F1 2011 and F1 2012 are for very little eye candy gain, it's still just as good on PC as it is on 360. The lack of improved graphics is dissapointing, but that shouldn't be enough to stop you buying this amazing game. You can read my 360 review of why this is the case if you want to know more.

The game doesn't run at a consistent frame rate, which felt slow to begin with.  Seems really off putting in a game that should have  a focus on combat.

This game goes above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to being the most casual, easy, boring, button-mashing trash ever. The ""hard"" difficulty ""Nephilim"" is easier than the easiest difficulty in DMC3. It's easier than easy mode in **** God of War 3. ""Son of Sparda"" it advertises as something that will require skill! It doesn't require anything except the ability to recognize when one of the monsters is doing their extremely telegraphed (so telegraphed in fact that they LIGHT UP IN BRIGHT NEON LIGHTS when they are about to do it) attacks.  Expect about 5 seconds to react to most enemies.  Not even kidding, time it.  One of the challenges I won by doing 2 attacks for 30 seconds. One, I would hold O to uppercut, and two, I would press O again to do a downward slash and then I repeated that until everything in the room was dead.  It's not like that's even an isolated incident.  Some moves provide so much invincibility that there's no reason to stop spamming, ever.Long story short, I am beyond disappointed.

This is not a problem. You see, what 'Sins' does is strip away all the surplus and really get to grips with what makes a fantastic strategy game.It was during my second playing of the game that something happened: I couldn't stop playing. It's like peeling an onion, only to cry a little more as another layer appears. It supplies something sadly lacking in many of the games I've played recently, depth. The controls/menus/UI are all deceptively simple, this just makes the game easy to play. Complexity comes from the myriad strategies possible from the many different options and tactics that can be employed as the game develops. Each game, I might add, feels unique. With a huge list of maps, options that can be tweaked on and off, and the ability to produce your own maps.I'm only on my fifth game, yet each time I've started up a new game I've become even deeper immersed. It's great because you can save whenever you like, so you can play little by little or a lot at a time, it's up to you. And when you feel confident (I'm not there yet) it can be played with a live opponent/s! Huge potential for employing the diplomatic elements of the game.I bought it for under £10 on steam, well worth the money. I expect it will go on to provide me a huge amount of satisfaction way beyond when other, more visual games have long fallen by the wayside.

People also complain that ""you have to pay another $120 for the full campaign"" which is not true, this game includes a much more in depth, much longer, campaign focusing on one race, they could have shortened it and made it comparable to the others but they put in a lot more effort to make this campaign be the best of any RTS, which I think it is.",KrzysztofJ.

THIS IS THE AMAZING SURVIVAL EXPERIENCE EVERYONE IS FAWNING OVER! It pisses me off even more that Metro Last Light came out this year and yet this piece of instant kill **** is the one that got all the attention. The game relies on the Instant killing clickers for Its difficulty, because those are the only enemy that you cant beat the **** out of. Your resources are always low not because you are constantly using them to fend of your enemies, they're limited because the world is so stupidly empty that you never had them to begin with. their is no tension about resource conservation when you NEVER GET THEM, human enemies almost never drop ammo, (which is just stupid, like I just manage to kill them when they had just used their last bullet) and guns just suck so why even use them, especially when you can LITERALLY BEAT ZOMBIES TO DEATH WITH YOUR BARE HANDS AND WIN. The game is a joke when clickers aren't around and then its only hard because they **** instant kill. Stealth is boring and has no tension because clickers are so damn easy to sneak by, (just move slow and hold still when the start to throw a hissy fit) and any other foe can just be beat to death. for a comparison lets look at Metro Last Light a far superior survival game that gets it right. supplies litter maps if you just know where to look, and the world is so detailed you'll always find new things you have to SCAVENGE and doing so is always rewarding encouraging you to do it more, while the last of us barley ever has **** anywhere, and if it is something it will always be something you don't need, like empty **** bottles. In Metro Last Light the threat comes from the enemies themselves, In the harder modes you can be quickly killed, but if your skilled enough you can avoid it, your not getting killed by a Animation is what I am saying. When you get into combat it requires the use of resources that will deplete the more YOU fail, the game gives you enough to thrive if you have the skill and if YOU **** up then YOU have to pay the price, not just get insta-killed and restart again or just punch the world to death. Metro Last Lights combat is fun, interesting, responsive, and satisfying while the last of Us has generic combat that's hard because its clunky, and I despise clunky controls because you end up fighting them more than the enemy. the stealth is where the last of us wins right? I disagree, while the stealth in Last Light is simplistic, that simplicity honestly makes it unique, whereas The Last Of Us has  stealth that is just like the stealth in pretty much every other stealth game made recently, I MEAN YOU EVEN HAVE DETECTIVE VISION COME ON! But aside from that its also just annoying, there is no satisfaction and it far too often breaks and I get seen through objects or when I shouldn't, Where in Last Light I only get spotted when I made a mistake or when I should encouraging me to try harder at it and look forward to a chance to prove my skill rather than dread the next stealth section. The best way to express my dislike for this game is the simple fact that the only time I had any fun is when nothing was happening and I was constantly dreading when the game would come back. that's not the sign of a good time. Also yes the characters and voice acting are good but Im too annoyed or bored to give a **** The game part of the game has to be bearable for the story to matter and this is honestly one of the worst third person shooter OR stealth games I've played in my life. The best description I could give of this game is if someone took dead space and uncharted taped them together and striped all the aspects that made those games good out only to have a bull come in and **** all over them to fill in the gaps. This game sucks, and I will NEVER understand why people praise this ""game"" like the patron saint. **** this game for wasting my day and **** everyone who would call it superior to Metro Last Light, or Dead Space 3 for that matter, It would be a blasphemy to say that Last Light compares to the Worst of the Dead Space games, let alone overshadow one of the best survival games made.",epicfuzz45

If they are needed to tell the story, then they are okay in my book. Gameplay is well done. All the gameplay flaws from Sons of Liberty have been ironed out and your vitality in a combat situation is well improved. Now to some of my major complaints. I actually found the camera excusable in Sons of Liberty due to the small and narrow corridors. In Snake Eater, the camera work is less than stellar. Environments are expansive and huge. The camera is useless now that I can't see ten feet in front of me and the radar has been omitted. I ran into several occasions where the game turned into a frustrating run and gun in some of the areas populated by numerous enemies. There is now a food system, which I thought  was implemented well, but now there is a cure system in which you have to pause the game and cure EVERY injury you receive. As you might expect, it can get rather tedious and is just an extraneous addition when bosses hit you with attacks that can constantly drain your health unless cured. The story of the game is superb. It becomes well appreciated and is very thoughtful. The soundtrack is once again composed by Harry Gregson-Williams and I have to say, it is a lot better than the occasional jazzy, lounge like tracks in sons of Liberty. But during the majority of the game, no music is heard except for bosses and alerts. I thought this made the game seem somewhat empty and unfinished. The graphics are gorgeous. They definitely push the PS2 to its limits. Overall, this is a good game especially if you are a fan of the series. It never reaches the heights of Sons of Liberty, but is a welcome addition to the franchise. My score may seem rather low, but if the camera issues and the cure system were fixed, I can definitely see this title receiving a 9.",pinipigbomb

Quick time events often change the way it plays. Lastly they will be a few ""you will rage moments"" in this game because of the enemies taking almost all of your ammo in the gun to kill completely which is a perfect example but hey it was the first game and it got improved in the sequels Get Over It.Overall- A good start through Naughty Dog's successful run in this game turns out good.Final Score : 8.4",Nightmarewrath

In a world where the video-game industry continuinally churns out tiresome, uninteresting manure like an overfed cow, Larian Studios finally delivers an extensive (and I mean, very extensive!) co-op campaign filled with ridiculous strategic depth, head-tilting puzzles and riddles, and a whole host of moral dilemmas to test your very customized characters.Of course, no game can ever truly be perfect, but as far as I'm concerned, Divinity: Original Sin II is about as close as a developer can hope to get. There are some balancing issues, the occasional bug, and some strange tactical decisions by the AI, but overall the game is a must-have for any man, woman or dwarf that enjoys a strong, well-established fantasy setting and turn-based combat that requires critical thinking, finesse, and a just a pinch of explosive creativity.As a small note, a very small minority of buyers beware: the story is a bit wacky and may not be the most serious at times. If you're looking for 12 hours of grueling, dark, humorless plot, you may be disappointed. For most prospective purchasers, this shouldn't be an issue.",ireviewbadgames

Touted too often as an artistic choice, in most games the presence of retro graphics is most likely the result of the developer's laziness. In some, such as Minecraft, it compliments the nature of the game quite nicely and perhaps nicer than more modern graphics would. I can thankfully add this game to the latter list, as the presence of 3D graphics or voice-acting (all dialog is in text form) would actually take away from the characters and story. It is meant to be simple but elegant, and the graphics do suit it in this case.Bearing in mind that this game is not trying to be a game so much as an interactive story, I won't really critique the gameplay elements so much. They mostly consist of searching for items with relevance to the story itself, and so fall under the story category. There are a few very simple puzzles that seem a bit out of place.Since this game takes the role of an interactive story, most criticisms of it must be based on that aspect. Fortunately, To the Moon really does pull its weight in that category. The setup is simple  a man is on his deathbed two years after his wife passed, and his last wish was to go to the moon for some uncertain reason. The two main characters, who act as observers most of the time, are doctors with the ability to enter the man's unconscious mind and alter his memories such that he believes he actually did. In order to do so, they must trace their way back through his memories until his childhood to find out why he wants to go to the moon. The emotional story centers itself primarily around the man's relationship with his wife, and builds to a climax that is both startling and heartbreaking.The two main characters sometimes clash with the plot in a non-productive way, however. One of them is meant to provide comic relief  and admittedly, there were some pretty fantastic moments in that field  but on occasion the comedy will come in contrast to the serious tone of the story which you are observing at the moment. Also, many of the elements of the story feel made up, out of place, and contrived simply to provide a reason for the story to continue in the manner the developer wanted. This is a sign of poorly thought out writing.But overall, To the Moon will provide you with about 3 hours of the most powerful writing I have ever seen in this medium.",gmboy902

There is no modern cover system implemented, which makes the combat feel a bit lacking, but it is not mandatory. It´s just that after R6:Vegas´s brilliant cover system, all other shooters feel a bit out dated. CoD 4 shines on some rare occasions, like the AC-130 scenario that actually feels like what the real thing is, the ability to shoot through some walls is a great addition.

If not, well, you've seen it done before and probably done better. A.I. is nonexistant on both sides of the conflict (i.e. your squad mates are useless). The game has a story, albeit a not very gripping one. The main character might as well be the one from the Doom series for all the personality he has (virtually nil for those unfamiliar with Doom). Weapon selection is decent, however, your choice of weapons is determined by the game and not your preference or proficiency. Don't get to attached to that magnum, because the ammo is going to dry up in 30 seconds. Want to try and beat the game with just the Fareye? You can try, but you'll have to melee 90% of the enemies, no matter how conservative or accurate your are with your ammunition. The game tries to create an atmosphere of fear in some areas (waves of zombie-like Chimera running at you in the dark), however, it's so telegraphed and predictable that there's no tension. Multiplayer varies. Issues aboujnd, but is quite fun when everything is working right. This game boasts 64 player matches, but good luck finding one.

Each class has their job to do to contribute to their team to reach their objective. Which could be capturing the point or capturing the enemy's intel. Each class has their own way to helping their team may it be building defenses or keeping team mates alive or disrupting the enemy team. They all have thier advantages and disadvantages, no class is overpowerd or even considered ""god like"". The 9 classes all have different personalities, looks and nationalities. Other games you'll just play as a souless generic soldier, mercenary that just say ""Capture the point!"" or ""Ugh"". Where as TF2 you'll play as CHARACTERS with different personalties. The scout may say ""BONK!"" or the heavy may say ""Entire team is babies!"". Also   Recieves updates weekly with mini updates and then huge updates which occur around in 4 months. TF2 has a large and friendly community, adding mods, items, maps, etc.Hatswell I don't see in anyway that adding hats has made the game worse. Though it may be added to make Valve have cash  so what? Other companies such as EA and Activision do differenet maybe similar marketing strategies. MMOs such as Maplestory and others make money via cosmetics. Besides you DON'T have to pay at all. No one forces you to pay for a hat. Valve may persuade you as Premium as you get more backpack slots. BUT Valve still does not force you to! It's not as if Valve will delete your account if you don't pay under 1 week if you're a free-to-pay. It's your choice and my choice whether you or I want to add money for hats. You and I could play Team Fortress 2 completely free paying $0.00 forever. But I decided to pay since I just felt like paying Valve for such a great game. You could think that each transaction for a hat is instead of paying Valve for a virtual hat instead for giving valve free money for a great game and getting a thank you in a shape of a cosmetic item.Now about Team Fortress going free-to-payI don't see what's wrong with it, I mean isn't stuff thats free usually good? It might of brought alot of new players but whats wrong with that? Whats wrong with playing unexperienced players that want to try something new? Everyone used to be bad at a certain game and the only way to get good is to keep on playing. I mean the Team Fortress 2 community is still strong and healthy for 6 years! Thanks to the free-to-play update the community is bigger than ever! What if there was free-to-play. There wouldn't be as much players as there are if it wasn't f2p and TF2 would of slowly died. TF2's community is built up of 5-12 year olds after the f2p update? That ain't true and if it was so what? Sure they may be annoying but eh deal with it. Call of Duty and Battlefield also has the same problem. Players are bad? Everyone starts off bad. I myself  started off free-to-play and was bad. Now that I have played the game for some time, I wouldn't consider myself bad or horrible, just in the higher middle (6/10). Everyone just gets better by playing the game and it can't hurt to have more players.Now about the ""Unbalanced Weapons and Classes""Let's see. That laser weapon people keep complaining? The Cow-Mangler 5000? It's a pretty underwhelming weapon now that it's received it's nerf sometime ago. Even so in it's un-nerfed state you're not a god at all. Sure you may be able to kill a couple people but there is always a way to be killed. Such as a Pyro reflecting the projectiles, Heavy Medic couple, Team Work? TF2 certainly is not pay to win as anyone can craft the weapon or find it. The new weapons may seem overpowerd but there is always a way to beat it and if it's really ridiculous it'll prob receive a nerf pretty soon. Laser weapons not following the 60's art style? Yeah it is it's what you call retro futuristic, look it up. No class is overpowerd.. It may seem so at times but thats just the player being really good as they may be playing competitive. Spy is overpowered? He could insta-kill you and you're team mates but thats up to your team. The point of the game is to work together as a team and if you do the spy probably could die before he could go on killing spree. The unlockables sometimes are, somtimes aren't direct updates to the defaults. Sometimes the best weapons are the defaults.There may be some weapons better than the default or others but still theres always a way to beat the person wielding the ""god gun.""I am going on a HUGE rant but that is all I see people giving such a great game a low score. People may say this game is repetitive but I find Call of Duty and others far more reptitive. Call of Duty, Battlefield, Halo are all great FPS in their own way but I always find my way back to playing TF2. In the end TF2 is my favourite FPS out of many others since it is creative, unique and overall FUN.",PikaCheeks

This is why you should go in not expecting a souls like game. This is a 2D game not a 3D game.

Good level design, good character customization. If you love platformers you will love this. And there is a lot of platforming in the game. This is why you should go in not expecting a souls like game. This is a 2D game not a 3D game. So think more Castlevania with stamina than dark souls. The biggest connection the game has to souls games is the die system and that's it really. The game is a good price and it's better than a lot AAA games. You certainly can't go wrong buying this game.This game is amazing and a really fun. I hope it does really well that we can have a sequel. I found it to have a rather interesting story. I love the art style if you are fan of indie art in games, anime or web art you will love this style. And when you are playing the game you can feel the time and love that the devs put into the game. It's very rare you will get that type of connection with a game. So many AAA games were thrown lots of money at and tossed out the door. So this game is refreshing. I know a lot of people would like a map for this game and It would have been nice, but I did find that the salt and sanctuary wiki one worked really well it's just a rough sketch of what it would be like but I found that to be enough. You can find it if you google as well ""salt and sanctuary map"". Once you get use to areas you will find your way around fairly easily. Another good point about this game is level design is amazing everywhere is connected I've only known a few games to be like this, so for an indie game to get it right. Well done Ska Studios! I look forward to see more games from this company even if it's not a sequel to this game.If you like old school Castlevania, Metroid, Dust: An Elysian Tail and other similar 2d games. You will love this game. As others have said it also gets inspiration from souls series games. It has same system in which when you die you have one chance to get the XP back, fail and it's gone forever. I really love this system and would love to see it in more games. How I see this game mechanic is similar to other game mechanics like levelling your char, save and continue, checkpoint, autosave, stamina, special attacks, etc. Well souls games were the first I believe to create that die system. We don't bash other games for copying other game mechanics like having save and continue, checkpoints, levelling and stamina in them. These are really standard things in the gaming world these days. And that's what I would like to see from this game mechanic. However I don't think anyone should bash a game just because it copied a very clever game mechanic.  If someone comes up with a really amazing idea in the game industry that will help make games better then people should use it for their game. This is how innovation usually works if someone/company does something really well then other companies/people usually copy it. It The reason I bring this up is because I see a lot of people that are bashing salt and sanctuary calling it a souls clone this is not true. The game could stand on it's own with out the souls stuff.  It just makes the game better. It is has some unique gameplay mechanics of it's own with the brands. Attaching the charms to the weapon something I really like. Want extra range on a weapon, or attack power just equip a charm.The only really downside to the game is the lack of music which is a shame I love game music. However music is usually extremely expensive even just to buy a licence of a already created track can be really costly. The game does have some music 3 or 4 background tracks that get repeated. On the plus side I rarely found it bothered me the repeating music. If the game had more funding it could have gotten some more music clearly the devs had to prioritise with the budget they had. Either way they did amazing job I'm not going to score points off for something that is out of their control. They did amazing job with the resources they had at hand and I'm glad they spent less on the music. They certainly made up for it in the good gameplay.",jrzone

And this is where the game really falls down.  If you don't have at least 4 friends online to play with, then you're forced to play with randoms (Heists, for example, don't have a single player option and very few missions do, too).

The year was 2008, and all I wanted for my birthday was one game, a game that had just come out in November, a game I had specifically showed my mother to get, Kirby Super Star Ultra. I woke up early the morning of my birthday, saw a gift that was in the shape of a DS game case, and hastily I tore away the gift wrapping. Inside, wasn't the game I had picked out. Instead, it was Chrono Trigger. In my mind, this was the best mistake my mom had made since I was conceived.Everything about Chrono Trigger is outstanding. The beginning opening with the festival is an example that shows most of what I mean. It teaches you about core game mechanics without seeming like a tutorial, it subtly constructs the world and the plot through every action you take, it endears the player to Marle which ensures that the player has a personal motivation for acting rather than just being told, ""that's what your character would do,"" and does this all while being a lighthearted romp in a festival. It ensures that you feel invested before the story starts, and that once the story does start you will be ready. Furthermore, the hidden ramifications of your actions at the festival, and having no characters forcing Crono to do anything,  highlight the influence that personal choices have in the narrative. The game is a seamless blend between the overarching plot and every action you take. Every main quest, every side quest, and every character decision is all part of accomplishing your main objective in the game. The characters all have distinctive personalities and unique movesets that mesh differently with everyone else, encouraging you to play with everyone, and endearing you to everyone.I could ramble on and on, but seeing all the other reviews it's unnecessary at this point. To summarize, Chrono Trigger is by far, the best JRPG, if not the best RPG, I've ever played.",danmfg

The lore was interesting. And the gameplay options were immense. Its boundless flexibility let you play the game the way YOU wanted to play and does not force you to play in a linear fashion. It was bundles of fun to enchant armor and weapons and alchemy was useful as was spellmaking which added a new dimension to the game that no other game to date has come close to matching, not even subsequent Elder Scrolls games. I still remember floating around with levitate or laughing in my 100% invisibility suit. Yea they were game breaking but in a game like this, it really did not matter since the game was not 100% about combat. It was just plain fun to do and once you do, you store the suit away and try something else for fun. No game has ever held my attention as long except maybe X3.Despite being my all time favorite game, it still had flaws that persist even in Oblivion and Skyrim.#1 - Combat was boring. Even though making spells is fun, normal combat is dull and enemies were way too easy to beat in part because they are just weak inherently and because the AI was bad. Some improvements were made in Skyrim but combat in ES games is still a weak point and needs to be addressed.#2 - There is no economy balance. I remember the great promise in Oblivion of a living, breathing world with NPC's doing jobs and participating in the world. It never happened. Turned out they were just scripted and the economy and world were still static. Morrowind was the same. by mid game, you pretty could own the entire island. Wealth is too easy to find which makes things somewhat dull since it does not feel earned.#3 - Lore was very strong in Morrowind but ironically, the story was somewhat meh. I wish there was a little more flare to the end game with harder enemies and a much grander finale but as it turns out, combat was simply trivial even if you did not exploit the game in any way. The enemies were just too weak and defeating the final boss was a trivial matter. Even the god Vivec was lame and could be defeated at level 1 with a bow and tons of arrows. I suppose this is just an extension of #1 above in some ways but I really wish that fighting was more epic. At least equip these bosses with game breaking items akin to what the player can make.Its a fantastic game, possibly the best RPG ever made, and with texture upgrades it still looks great today but it is still not a perfect game. Hopefully they will read this before they make the next game as the series keeps devolving. The ES games are still great and I liked Skyrim but it is not in the same league as Morrowind. Its too dumbed down in comparison and not nearly as much fun to play.",marc5477

And I don't care for coop things: when I want a group, I play table RPGs with friends in the flesh.I don't blame too much the setting and the rules system. D&D is what it is, its rules get worse with each newer edition, for reasons I won't discuss here, yet the video game version has to run with that. Using kitchen sink Faerun, the worst campaign setting ever designed for D&D, wasn't mandatory, but I understand it is commercially successful, since it feels more like contemporary USA than exotic ancient times. Don't worry if you don't get my meaning, it's not an important point.Now, also with the times, the game goes 3D, losing the past appeal of the IE games, and looking seriously dull as a result. I can now play in 3rd person perspective. But I'd rather not, thank you very much.Time to mention some serious flaws. The biggest possibly concerns the companions. They are gone. Now you have mercenaries, all waiting for you in orderly fashion at the same inn. No interesting introductions, no unlocking, no nothing. You can pay and pick one to come with you. Yes, one. And you don't control it and don't access his inventory. With half the fun gone with each of these restrictions, there's about 6% of fun left. I decided to play solo and never looked back.As usual, I built a rogue. I could pickpocket, but it never, absolutely ever, brought me anything of worth. And 99% of the time, nothing at all. I'm serious. And for some retarded reason, there's a bloody cooldown constraint between 2 attempts. That one seriously grated my nerves. Even for a rogue, the quantity of locks and traps found on anything, even a barrel, constitutes an abuse. The fact that what a trap is supposed to protect is often worth less than the trap itself speaks volumes of the design effort. Also, thanks to insane randomisation, you can find riches in a street barrel and junk in a treasure chamber. Setting traps happened to be another waste of time; better sell them, if you can find the only merchant who will buy them (just another nonsensical constraint.) Sneaking works good though, I have to say; I've never had the need for magical invisibility. Sneaking is surely the most powerful tactical tool in the game.Merchants also got downgraded. Their inventory, just like yours, is a mess. You have to peruse each object one by one just to see if one of them is anything special. You also buy and sell items 1 by 1. Want to buy a potion or magical item ? Description tells you what spell it emulates, not what it actually does, and that's it. Better yet, 2/3rds in the game, I realised that even merchant prices are random ! And with a huge interval of randomness. Yet another time waster of a save/load routine.Let's speed up some more inanities: You can't find or even buy low levels spells after a while. At this point, leveling to Wizard 2 would cost you millions of XP anyway, because multiclassing is seriously flawed. Your equipment is much more important and powerful than your skills. Many skills do nothing but bring or save you money, therefore they are completely useless (as usual, you carry millions of weightless gold pieces in your front pocket.) cosmetic dialogues galore,  no quick load shortcut, broken path finding, dreadful voice acting, useless consumables… Sorry, can't be exhaustive in less than 500 pages.What good is left then ?, you ask. The variety of builds, i.e., a rich character creation system. UI-wise, a good toolbar. And combat is dynamic, still varied, if never really challenging once you bought the protection belts. I can't tell you what non-undead bosses can do because they don't have a chance to do anything against an assassin. I almost forgot: if they decide to talk when nearly dead, just go out and have a 7 courses dinner to give the assassin's paralysis enough time to wear off.",Voyou

Keys(a 2.5 octave midi keyboard that can be played sitting or as a keytar) adds the last traditional rock instrument to the mix.  With keys and harmony vocals(as first seen in The Beatles Rock Band) you can now have up to 7 players simultaneously rocking out.

You're playing the actual guitar, bass, drum, and keyboard parts.While not as flashy, the new song management system is crucial for Rock Band players with hundreds of songs in their collection.  Also handy is the ability to save custom playlists.  The song selection is a great mix of classic hits, new stuff, and deep cuts. The only cons I can see:1. A few songs from RB1 and RB2 won't transfer into the RB3 library.2. Gone are crowd-singalongs for RB3 on-disc songs.3. To get the full Rock Band experience you need to spend a lot of money to get a pro guitar, keys, drum cymbals, and all the great DLC that is available.

The campaign is fun, the story isn't fantastic but there are some interesting sections to play through and the characters have some mildly amusing dialogue, although not as much as the first game. The online multiplayer is where this game really impresses. There are only 3 modes, squad death match is where 4 teams of 4 players go around the map and try to reach 40 kills before any other. Rush involves one team of 12 attempting to destroy two points before advancing, up to five times depending on the map, and doing so again. Conquest is the classic Battlefield game type where 12v12 teams attempt to gain control of flags and elimate all enemy respawn tickets (250 each I think); the more flags you hold, the easier is it to deplete their tickets. There are four combat classes, assault where you get access to many assault rifles, and have the ability to resupply comrades with ammunition to earn extra points. Engineer has access to silenced SMGs and RPGs, as well as the ability to repair friendly vehicles, or hi-jacked enemy ones. The Medic class can revive recently killed team mates, as well as supply health packs to those who have been badly wounded in a gunfight; this class can use machine guns. The Recon class has access to sniper rifles, and can stay back from the main fight a spot enemies (all players can spot, but recon class can spot from a distance and pick off enemies). Recon can call in mortar strikes on a position.The maps are huge and destructible, virtually every building and tree can be razed to the ground and huge craters appear in the ground where mortar fire rains down. You can play with 4-squad mates, whom you can chat with, and you can respawn on them if they're in trouble or safe, depending on how daring you are. Respawning is the best of any online shooter, you only get killed on spawning if you spawn on a squadmate in imminent danger. You can spawn quite safely in the team's base. Vehicles play a huge part, with different kinds of choppers and tanks and others to take the attack to the enemies. The guns looks and sound fantastic, and with the volume turned up and 'War Tapes' sound setting on, it really immerses you into a proper battle. Be warned, if you're used to playing Call of Duty, there is a steep learning curve to get used to the heavier feel of the game, but once you get through it, there is no game better at making you feel like part of a battle or part of a team. It's the best online shooter out there, so give it a go.",dupplawt

I'm an avid Bioshock fan and I thought the first one was fantastic. Second one was nowhere near as good but had some great moments and it was great for fans wanting more from the Bioshock universe. However, for all the rich storyline details and a wealth of subject matter that makes you think about the gritty details,  I feel Infinite has failed to live up to expectations in more than one area.I am not going to mention spoilers as the story is the strong point within a very linear product. Not that replay ability has ever bothered me, but there is zero chance of returning to this game once completed and that's not just because of the story and how it unfolds, this is due to the filler sections that are a chore to play through first time round. This, in my honest opinion makes this game worth less than the full retail price.Secondly, the graphics are standard. As a member has already mentioned they have filled the game with lighting, bloom and post processing trickery that tries to hide the graphical short comings. I am playing on a top spec PC and I am pisappointed when comparing Infinite to other games on offer.Lastly, the final nail in the coffin for me was the combat. I felt like I was back in 2007 with the only upgraded features worth mentioning being the combination of vigors and better weapon physics.Having just finished Dead Space 3 (an evolution for a series although many disagree), MoH War fighter (how that got 35% from PCGamer UK is beyond me) and Max Payne 3, Infinite was a game I felt I had to complete just so I could uninstall. The other games I have mentioned were a blast from start to finish and I didn't want them to end. It is hard to put my finger on what it is about Infinite I really don't like and maybe LIKE is the wrong choice of words... It's not that it is a bad game; it has all the attention and care we have come to expect from Levine and his team. But Infinite, with all its potential to be a gaming masterpiece, played it too safe for me and stuck by a formula that worked in 2007 to 2010 but today, is a storyline the only thing that pushes games forward? I personally think it a game needs to be a more balanced product that offers a good story line and good gameplay mechanics A game featuring these should be labelled as potential masterpieces.",keeling2008

The game is very open end, and you can take on challenges the way you see fit, whether that be through brute force, sneaking a back way  through vents, cloaking your way through, or hacking a computer and making a robot fight for you. The voice acting for the most part is solid, and the plot is enthralling, with the added effect that what you do influences plot points. An effective dark atmosphere is created, although the gold and black colour scheme may not appeal to all. However, the game is far from perfect and has definite weakness. The AI  in particular, can be quite dumb at times, especially with regards to their alertness to your presence and their reactions. Sometimes enemies get stuck in doors and sometimes they run around like complete buffoons. In addition, the boss fights are unnecessary and do not belong and often rely on saving and loading until you eventually do enough damage to kill them. This concept does not fit well with a game where choice is one of the most prevalent aspects. These pitfalls aside, Human Revolution is still a great game which presents you with many choices and ways to tackle a problem. A link between various genres is done successfully and as a result, an enthralling package is produced, despite the shortcomings.",lach1223

Before I start, let me say that I've only played the game a little with my friend, so I couldn't get that much of a feel for it.

The twoLooks like I'm going to have to jump in here and help out this score as much as I can.  Before I start, let me say that I've only played the game a little with my friend, so I couldn't get that much of a feel for it.  But I am going to base it off of what I've seen so far, which is the full campaign and several hours of multiplayer.  First of all, let's stop comparing this to MW3.  The two are not truly comparable.  Second, let's look at what makes a game good: Depth, replayability, completeness...  The story line was excellent, as it gives you a chance to make your own choices, which is new to a CoD campaign.  It avoids the complexity of an RPG, which is what the cod series has done on purpose to focus more on multiplayer.  The zombies is more complicated than ever, which adds a challenge, but I think another kino map is needed with less complexity just to balance it out (for those who liked to run in circles until round 100).  Next, replayability: the game has infinite replayability on multiplayer: even if the playerbase ends in 10 or so years, a person can still play against AI in combat mode.  Ok.  Let's look at the multiplayer.  Gamers need to keep an open mind:  I like to explain the gameplay like a cross between BO1 and Homefront.  The lower but still good scorestreaks are decently easy to get, so everyone can feel good when they play, and the better players can go for the higher scorestreaks while forced to play the objective to do so, since more points are given for doing that than just being a mercenary.  The pick 10 create-a-class is an ingenius addition alone -- one of the best they could have made.  The maps are decently balanced as far as I've seen.   Completeness:  Obviously, the developers could have spent more time on it, but the fans demand so much in so little time, that I think that they delivered what they could in relatively excellent quality.If you look at this like a standalone game without prequels, then it's pretty darn good.  Let's keep in mind that call of duty is a revolutionary concept, and this game truly added to the original while keeping a lot of it's aspects.

It is perhaps too much and overwhelming. Thankfully this is quickly, if not quick enough, overcome through character progression. ThereShadow of Mordor is a sublime game that combines hard difficulty with fantastic gameplay along with a story that will please all Lord of the rings fans and gamers alike.The first thing that stands out about tis game is its difficulty at the beginning. It is perhaps too much and overwhelming. Thankfully this is quickly, if not quick enough, overcome through character progression. There are times when it seems unfairly hard out-with the progression mechanic, sometimes being surrounded by too many captains for no explicable reason (at one point I was surrounded by 4 captains just trying to free one slave). But at the end of the game success feel all the sweeter due to the games difficulty.My biggest problem with the game was the respond rate of enemies. At times it was ridiculous. At times I could see enemies responding around me in areas I had just cleared out, this a slow tactical approach for me at certain times. his was especially true at the beginning as you move through the world slower and more cautiously. The long term effect of this is that you don't feel like you are impacting the world, not even a small corner as all enemies will return so quickly. This is only natural due to the setting, Mordor, yet is unsatisfying mechanically. What it lacks is the taking over of areas, an expected mechanic of open world games. However implementation of tis could cause different issues.The world feels small and that is an issue. You lots of tasks in the same areas/strongholds and that c be tedious especially with refreshing enemies (Differs greatly to a game such as dragon age inquisition). On the topic of the world, the environment lacks variety. This naturally is the nature of being in the shadow of mordor and it is fixed slightly in second half but I still feel like more could have been done visually in the areas to differentiate each area of the map.The much hyped nemesis system is simply fantastic. It is true innovation. Enough people have talked about how it works that theres no need to cover this, the most surprising thing is that it just works so well. Through the nemesis system the world feels connected and living. This is where impact on the world comes in. It can become a fantastic distraction from the main plot that can devour whole evenings of your time. It is very exciting to see future applications of this system. Getting the ability to control enemies changes the game and the nemesis system completely at the right time. The game just gets better and better.The story is fantastic. The characters are fitted into the known lore nicely. And the lore is slightly altered to great effect. The story is paced superbly and truly gets to an epic peak fitting of the license. Old characters such as Gollum are fantastic and new characters, Torvin especially, are great.The game boasts some excellent side missions, particularly the weapon related missions. However freeing slaves becomes too repetitive. Added to this is a good range of collectibles scattered across the map. Unlike some games the volume of collectibles is perfect and not too overwhelming. They add story and aid progression nicely. However the pay off for 100% collection is pretty poor.At the core of the game is excellent gameplay. The combat is excellent. It is fluid and weighty and as mentioned difficult. There is great progression eventually from weak to strong. There are great abilities to unlock that add depth to combat and new ways to approach it and thankfully the AI is fairly strong. One issue is that climbing may be too powerful. Enemies lack anywhere near the same level of climbing or manoeuvrability. This makes escape easy and height a great advantage. They generally resort to trying to make you fall rather than follow Games like Assassins Creed have overcome this issue with mobile enemies and this is lacking here. Otherwise the combat is pretty flawless.This is simply a fantastic game once you get some progression and adjust to the difficulty. A must play.",Davidscj

If you are looking for some sort of hybrid between the Hot Pursuit series and the Burnout series that tries to be both but turns into neither, then this is your game. Need for Speed: HotIf you are looking for a reboot of the Hot Pursuit series, then don't look here. If you are looking for an upgrade to the Burnout series (the game the creators made before this), then don't look here. If you are looking for some sort of hybrid between the Hot Pursuit series and the Burnout series that tries to be both but turns into neither, then this is your game. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is a game with all the bells and whistles to attract any racing gamer but with none of the depth to make it worth-while. So let me just start in with Single Player. There's no story, no substance like any of the previous Need for Speed games and, after about 5 hours, you'll find yourself droning on between the different races because there's just not a lot of interesting to do. It also doesn't have the flare of driving to each race track that Burnout Paradise had, which would have been fabulous considering its a driving game so I like to spend the game... driving. And then you might be thinking that at least it must have killer races, except most of the racers are time trials and you will spend literally the first 10 hours of gameplay trying to just get some stupid gold medal for no reason. It's not worth it. Basically, Single Player will not hold you over and it's beyond boring. So then I swapped over to Multiplayer. It's amazingly flawed. First of all, you can't play anything online unless you've unlocked one car for either racer or cop in the single player. Whomever designed that system, it's really bad and stupid. But I thought meh, I'll earn more for being good. Except the game not only rewards having the highest level, but gives you a HUGE boost for being the highest level in the game. So a level 7 vs a level 20 is not an even match. How did that slip by the creators? Still, I let that roll off my shoulder and decided to at least try. The multiplayer feels exactly like the single player, bland and flawed. I think my favorite flaw is that racers can drive backwards and go behind the cops and wait. Why the hell is that even allowed? But wait, it gets better. They also call this a dog chasing a rabbit type of game (No joke, that's almost a direct quote from before the game came out), except it's like being a dog with absolutely no teeth. Seriously, I could catch up to the racers but I couldn't do anything to them as a cop. On the other side, being a racer isn't about racing anymore, but more about swiveling in circles around the cop. I think the creators need to really retool and refocus this game so that it's more towards what it's supposed to be about. Racing. If a racer stops, give him a few seconds before he's disqualified for running away. That way they have a reason to always be moving forwards. Also, racers need to know that they are still in a race, where first place is the only winner, not this ""group win"" crap where even if you get disqualified for holding the cops up you are a winner. It should be racers against racers and cops and cops teamed up to take down the racers. Not racers vs cops. That's I think the largest flaw with the online. And on the other side, cops shouldn't be able to hurt each other as easily as it is in this game. Seriously, I launched an EMP and it decided to latch onto the cop to the let instead of the racer right in front of me. That's bad programming and it ruins the game. Last, the online felt... dated to say the least. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend.",Nobod3

This isExcept for combat, there is not much going on for Divinity: Original Sin. Environments are decent, crafting is decent, yes there are many, many recipes but nothing that stands out. Most dialogue is fun. Quest navigation is all right, the player is given enough clues to get going, and the journal logs all the dialogue from the first line in the game.Now for the bad part: No races. This is the most striking thing for me, the dialogue is not voiced, the Bio would be the same, so I see no reason why the developers could not add a couple more player models. More bad: The Rogue class in this game is utterly useless piece of effing dead weight. In calssics like BG II: SoA for example such a character was a valuable addition. But here his dmg is way, way (I cant stress this enough) subpar to the Ranger, Rogues cant dual-wield (huh?!), Rangers with high Awareness (which is a decent stat for them) can just see traps and ground shoot them. Rogues are my second favorite RPG class after Wizards, so this is a big downside for me. Speaking of magic users, Wizards are completely imbalanced. Air magic dominates all school trees, the first support character will cover most other magic needs with Rain, Heal, Teleport (playing with 2 Teleports is too OP) and any other points put in a different magic tree of your main Wizard other than Air magic significantly decrease dmg output. Next: money. Gold is really scarce in the start, so the player cant afford anything other than a few healing pots. Spellbooks look like something from the Vatican Archives, items look like the new limited edition Channel collection. The way around that is to steal from houses which is so easy in this game, its stupid. Another stupid thing is that Secret Agents working for the government are forced to petty theft for chump change. The devs should have thought of some way to get gold in the start, after that gold is not an issue any more, and if the second main character has Barter high enough, the player can hoard on pretty much anything. Which is another imbalance - no gold in the start, gold is irrelevant afterwards. And lastly its not open-world, the game is almost entirely linear and its not very long, its rather short compared to classics and TES games. If you see bad scores, know they are given by children who are lied that they have played real RPGs and are usually fans of ME, WoW and consider Dragon Age to be hardcore (it was the only good one after KotoR but still a far cry). On the other hand the perfect scores are given by Kikcstarters to self justify and suppress buyers remorse. So take everything with a grain of salt. My best tip: skip this one and wait for Pillars of Eternity.7/10",Ivan665

That's a good thing if it was all the same it would get boring like call of duty and assassins creed. 2. Complete **** this is far from a generic shooter and I will explain that later. On to the review, let's start with story. JustOne of the most overhated games of all time. A lot of people give this game crap because it's different from the first game and more like a generic shooter 1. That's a good thing if it was all the same it would get boring like call of duty and assassins creed. 2. Complete **** this is far from a generic shooter and I will explain that later. On to the review, let's start with story. Just like the first game your brought to a lighthouse in the ocean but this time it's in 1912 instead of 1960 and there's no plane crash, instead your on a boat with two mysterious people. The protagonists name is Booker Dewitt, he needs to find a girl named Elizabeth and bring her to New York to wipe away some sort of unspecified debt. This lighthouse launches him up into the sky to Columbia. Columbia's look is based off of that of the worlds fairs. But this city is run by a crazy cult leader named Zachary Comstock who isn't as cool as Andrew Ryan, but effective enough by the end. He runs the city through extreme religion and nationalism. It's also very racist, but that's by default because it takes place in 1912. It doesn't go deep into racism like other people think. But the city knows that you aren't supposed to be there and you have to protect yourself. Once you rescue Elizabeth you and her try to adventure out of Columbia and go to New York, but weird things happen and everything gets involved in the religious origins of the city, alternate universes, why the characters are what they are. It's extremely well told, every character shows emotion and is perfectly acted. I recommend turning on the subtitles to pay attention to everything the characters say. At first you may be confused, but once you understand it, it's really freaking cool and it's amazing how they made such an intricate plot with little to no holes, at least none that I could find. It made sense to me and should to you also as long as you really pay attention. Now for the reason everyone hates this game, the gameplay. It's like the first game where you have guns and superpowers and loot and collect stuff. But it approaches these ideas in a completely different way. You have to remember this isn't a survival horror game like the first one it's more like a swashbuckling action game. But it's not full of scripted sequences, linear hallway levels and bland enemies like many haters say it is. Many things are taken away or simplified. There are no power to the people machines, instead you just buy the same upgrades with money. But you can't get all upgrades in one playthrough so it at least upgrades. The vigors (plasmids) are all given to you and you also buy there upgrades instead of upgrading them with Adam. Just like weapons you have to play it multiple times to see them all. And three tonic categories? Replaced with 4 gear slots. But instead of buying them you have to find them and you don't have to stop at a gene bank to switch them around, you can do it on the go for different situations and there's only gear per slot, and they have bigger affects than tonics. It's different and brings in new strategies for the gameplay. They removed picture taking, hacking is dumbed down to possession, and a few other things are taken away. But it doesn't take away without giving back. There's the skyhook, which is way better than the wrench(but not as cool as the drill) it can be combined bizzarely with other vigors and gears for interesting results, it can be used for gory executions which is enertaining. You can also fly up to freight hooks to get vantage points. The skyline is also awesome and changes things up. It works the way it should and you can fly around the battlefield gracefully and gives access to so many unique battle opportunities. Then there's Elizabeth who will help you find supplies, and also give you supplies. But she doesn't give you an unfair advantage over everybody, many times she will say ""sorry that's all I've got"". She can also summon many things from alternate universes called tears to bring in tesla coils to electrocute enemies, health packs, and many other things. The enemies are bizarre and diverse, from handymans to robo washingtons with mini guns. The gameplay is fun and diverse and highly replayable with lots of opportunity and feels different and fresh. The graphics aren't realistic but enhance the scale and beautiful vistas of this floating city. Everything sounds cool and badass and keeps you in the right mood at the right times, sound effects, music, etc. This game is different but equally as good as the original. If your tired of boring copy and paste shooters every year and want something unique and refreshing, than I absolutely recommend this game and is well worth whatever price you pay (it's like 20 bucks nowadays) This game and Dishonored are also proof that not every triple A title needs goddamn tacked on multiplayer to be worth buying!",MasterThiefXIV

Having not played Max Payne in a while it took a while to adjust to the controls and the AI was pretty tough to beat at first on this difficulty so I felt frustrated and wasn't really into the game.

If there's not a cutscene going on then bet your ass there is a balls to the wall shootout or a ingeniously designed action set piece to dazzle your eyes and boggle your mind. It's like Rockstar is trying to channel there inner Naughty Dog with this effort. And for the most part they succeed. Where they fail, is in the graphics for me. And before you jump my bones, let me explain. Alot of the game is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. Particularly Max Payne's rendering himself and some of the locales (like when Max switches to that Hawaiin shirt and battles gangs in the slums....GORGEOUS. However, there are FAR TOO MANY framerate jumps and poor textures in this game. And some of the animations look just as bad as they did on GTA4. And that was made five years ago. And the nonstop shootouts CAN get just a tad repetitive although they are a blast to play. Aside from that, where Max Payne 3 really shines is in it's characterization and character development of it's lead hero. This is INCREDIBLY well done. You literally feel like you're in the mind of Max. You feel his pain, his frustration, his addiction, his regret, his inner demons and turmoul. You feel sorry for the guy. So when he kicks ass, you're rooting for him. That's one helluva accomplishment. The flashbacks are brilliantly done as well. All in all the game is seriously fun.

200640,Pokemon Diamond Version,DS,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This just might be my favorite game of all time. Granted, nostalgia is a large factor, so I'll be ignoring that. This game has three great starters, making you really think about which you want, as well as plenty of great Pokemon to catch along the way. Now, it's hard to screw up a JRPG, so the gameplay is what you expect. More noteworthy is the story and the characters. Starting with your rival, he's a confident and VERY energetic character determined to be the greatest trainer. This is something that was sorely missed in the previous and upcoming two generations. Your rival is actually competing with you this time, and he actually has some character development. He will come to terms with not being as strong as you, but keep pushing to become better. There is another companion character in Dawn/Lucas (depending on your gender,) but she/he is a waste in my opinion, you never get to battle them though you get to battle alongside them a couple of times. The evil organization is Team Galactic this time. People don't give this team enough credit, they had the BIGGEST plans for any team, and got pretty close to their goal. The leader of this team and the main villain, Cyrus, is the perfect villain for someone of his position. He wants to create a new, perfect universe, by altering time using Dialga. In the end, he deceived everyone in Team Galactic. He had no intention to share his world with them, which makes him a very hate-able villain. To top it off with the characters, this region has the indisputable BEST champion: Cynthia. The only female champion shocked me when I saw her in the champion's room, but overall I guess it made sense. With a team of powerhouses, Cynthia is one of the toughest trainers in the series. But I'm not done, This is the most important generation in the competitive scene. The physical-special split was a much needed split and some of the best competitive Pokemon, such as Garchomp, were added.This game is amazing. But not as good as Platinum. :P",Ectsoplasm

Its strange narrative, point-and-click mechanics and lack of any sort of traditional gameplay makes it appear intimidating at first glance. Yet the game is so well-made, with such detail in its presentation and sound design, that it proves impossible not to be swept up in its magical tale.

The new id Tech 6 brings the graphics and the animation to a more gorgeous level. Sound and music are so-so, not normalized between cutscenes and actual gameplay. Story plot is not very believable and I will explain below. The actual gameplay is very shortcomparing to the New Order and cutscenes takes too much time to watch. Level design and gameplay mechanics in whole are not so outstanding like in New Order.The political part:I played the whole campaign and did some research trying to convince myself that Bethesda and Machine Games weren't affected by the left wing ideology.But honestly I failed. And it's nothing about ""Making America Nazi-free again"".Three things in short:1. The Polish but non-Jewish father.2. The New York underground resistance.3. The New Mexico and Texas white supremacy.And now we are analyzing them one by one.1.In the original Wolfenstein series, BJ's whole family are Polish Jews immigrated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the Galveston Movement of 1907-1914, which caused by the anti-semitic policy of Russian Empire. W2TNC makes BJ a Texas-born Jew with a Jewish Polish mother but a non-Jewish Polish cruel father. But you can not find much more information about the father during the main campaign and the characteristics really look like right-wing white supremacy racist southern slave owners. There is never a white person inside the United States without obvious pro-Nazi tendency in the Wolfenstein series rendered as a Nazi. This is the first time, not even in WTNO and WTOB.2.The New York underground resistance is obviously inspired by The Black Party of 1966, which is a left-wing Pro-Firearm Socialist black organization who build their finance by selling Maoist little-red-book to left-wing students of University of California, Berkeley. Despite the inspiration by Marxism of the Zionism, the Jews in Soviet Russia were cruelly oppressed during the entire Soviet period from Lenin to Stalin to Brezhnev and the Jews in Poland were oppressed since the 1921-Poland-Russia war until 1991-Soviet-collapse. The Communists killed not so fewer Jews under their overseeing than the Nazis. The Communism-loving Jews like Lev Borisovich Kamenev were executed by Stalin, how could you expect a modern Jew to cooperate with Communists inspired parties like the Black Panther? Never mention that the New Black Panther is an anti-semitic group which is also Pro-Firearm and left-wing and even inspired the costume of the Antifa.New York is a tiny land that has only 789 Skm with no much room for agriculture and is Nuked by the Nazi in the game but still can offer shelters, clean food, drinkable water and air for the resistance? I'm not racist but why all young Black Panther and there is only one old white in the New York underground resistance? And the female leader can even breed new-born after getting radiated near the ground-zero?3.For comparing, Texas has 695,600 Skm and the No.1 cattle and calves, the No.1 cotton and the No.6 dairy products in the United States. The New Mexico has 315,200 Skm and the No.9 dairy products, No.16 cotton, and 1.3M cattle and calves produce in the United States. But can not shelter a resistance group with no nukes dropped on them?In history, the African slaves were transported to North America through the eastern shores of the British occupied continent, which makes Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina the highest black population states of the US even today. Detroit becomes the highest black population city in the US due to historically more tolerant to African slaves, which by percentage is 84% in around 2015.But New Mexico and Texas? They are the top Hispanic and Latino population states alongside with California in the US. By data from the United States Census Bureau, Hispanic/Latino and Black/African population percentage in these three states are NM:48.5% vs 2.5%, Texas: 39.1% vs 12.6%, and California: 38.9% vs 6.5%. It's obvious that the Hispanic and Latino population are totally ignored in the game.4. And there are many other details in the game obviously affected by left-wing ideology but I will talk about them some other time.Conclusion: Wolfenstein II The New Colossus is indeed turning left and being politically correct.Please correct me if I'm wrong.",Wolfendoomquake

Nintendo couldn't even beat their own lasting appeal of this game with Brawl (which I thought was a bit too slow). From the moment the amazing opening is played, to your very last GAME, this is a classic for the ages. Not only is the gameplay quick, but it's easy to pick up and play, and the intentionally made technical tricks in the game make it the most versatile fighting game to date. Your ability to gain more skill in this game is practically unlimited in this game. You aren't restricted with the movements of your character. You can reduce your recoil when you hit the ground, slide around the floor, and string combos around in the most creative ways if your good enough. The music is fantastic. Really legendary in the video game environment, right down to the announcer's voice when you begin and end a game. The Adventure mode is perhaps the perfect distraction in single player sector, but while memorable, it's more of an imperfection that we soon come to see improved in the next game. Event matches are a blast, and personally I find them a little more fun than Brawl's. It's creative how Nintendo can fit so many neat modes in this game. Their's slow melee, lighting melee, big, tiny, etc. The photo feature in the game is the most useless addition however, as you can't take pictures unless you choose the mode and plan something to happen. This is another feature that's fixed in the next generation. Still this is the most solid fighting game I have ever played and is a blast to play with friends and family alike.

It's a nice restart for the series, and sets a good foundation, which is really what this game needed after the pretty terrible start. Just across the board improvements. Better combat dynamics, less one shot deaths, plot that doesn't make you cringe, new environs are amazing.But the game is about loot, and they finally seem to be getting the hang of it.Game is less about stacking trifecta now and more about combing key pieces in interesting ways, (and various new affixes) which in some ways circumvents the loot wall, since finding a piece leads to you completely changing your gear around it, which means you need to find pieces to support that. It can get pretty complex when you find yourself weighing the benefits of multiple pieces of gear. If only I could wear 26 pieces! My favorite item I've found are some bracers that restore my resource every time I pick up a health globe. Kind of game breaking, but in a good way.If you played the original, hated Inferno, hated the drop rates, and hated how dull the items were, it's probably worth checking out.

This game was very much a mixed bag for me (thus the five)....most of the other reviews here have covered anything, but I'm going to add mine because maybe it'll help me feel a little bit better about the 50+ hours I just sunk in to this game.  Did I enjoy the story?  Yes (I can handle some melodrama, that's fine...and sure I can swallow some of the awkward writing).  No surprise about the game being beautiful (and it really, really is, especially in HD).  Then there's the gameplay: linear, linear, linear.  Walk cutscene, fight, walk, fight, cutscene.  Ok, this mean the story needs to keep me interested (and it did, I kept going).SPOILERSThen Orphan shows up.  Death To All?  Really?  So if I don't have the right accessory then I have to rely on luck to not instantly die?  REALLY? 50+ hours later and I'm screwed--I don't have the gil to buy things, and my saves are at the ending...so I guess I lose.  Thanks FFXII.All I can say is make sure you read a walkthrough/guide, or expect to be really frustrated at the end.",rave_rd

ActorsLA NOIRE - a revolution in video game design but a flawed one at that.L.A Noire is a game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. You play as Cole Phelps, a former war hero turned LAPD cop who is trying to move on with his life after the war. The game is set in Los Angeles, California in 1947. The most famous aspect of L.A Noire is the 'MotionScan' technology. Actors play out the scenes and every movement is motion captured and placed in the game. The result is a truly engaging detective experience where body language and facial expressions are a key tool to cracking the case. L.A Noire is a game which wouldn't have been possible without this technology.L.A Noire's gameplay is made up of 4 scenarios. Driving around LA to cases, investigating the evidence at the crime scene, interrogating witnesses and suspects and car chases/on foot chases. Many people will say the game is linear, but it honestly is not. Because of the nature of the game, every case is unique, which can't be said for Grand Theft Auto.Although a lot of people will be impressed with the content of this game, some aspects of L.A Noire has been done before. Searching for clues, investigating items and keeping a notebook record was done in 2000 by Shenmue but L.A Noire does it FAR better and expands on it. Phelp's notebook keeps a log of 'People of Interest', 'Locations' and 'Clues' relating to a case. If you join the Social Club, you can use intuition points which are earned by ranking up, to remove an answer for an interrogation, ask the community or show all the clues.That said, L.A Noire expands on these concepts, puts them in a narrative that they fit and provides an engaging story and experience which you shouldn't miss.Buy it!!",FeelinLuckyPUNK

121336,Fallout 4,XboxOne,6,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I love everything about Fallout 4, but I don’t like the game.So Fallout 4 is a tricky one for me. I bought into the hype. I lurk the sub-reddit with all its crazy bug gifs. I get jealous reading about amazing sub-quests that lead you down a deeper and deeper rabbit hole. But 20 hours in, something has still not clicked. It might be the environment as I’ve never been a big fan of post-apocalyptic worlds. It might be the Xbox One version with its poor load times, or even the steep learning curve at the start of the game that has caused me numerous frustrating reloads.Whatever it is, I just can’t seem to push past it. Whilst the storyline is basic in the best of ways, that of a parent looking for their missing son, the delivery seems heavy handed and often jars against the expectation of what you imagine you would do in that situation. As an example - a few hours after leaving the vault and learning your fate in this new alien world, you become the general of a once legendary group of rebels. I understand Bethesda want to empower the player, but something about this feels oddly over-important so early on and it really detracts from the simple drama of finding your missing son.It’s not all bad. The graphics, whilst already feeling dated in 2016, do enough to immerse and I think there has not been enough mention online about the extraordinary sound design and soundtrack. The timesink of crafting upgrades for weapons, armour, houses, settlements and power armour is very much welcome in a game that begs to be binged. And even though the VATS system seems somewhat game breaking, the combat is exhilarating from the start.Overall, I’m left feeling like I’ve missed out on something key to Fallout 4 which is holding me back. I get excited when I read a story about a hidden quest, a powerful weapon or a twist in the storyline - but unfortunately the experience for me doesn’t feel worth my few hours of after work gaming time.",workthengames

I can't recommend it to non-gamers, as to understand the inherent logic of this game; you need to be in a position where you already understand the tropes and limitations of games.This game takes the idea that you as a gamer have 'learned' ways of playing games, and that before you even play a game you have a common understanding between you and the developer about what should happen in these games.The Stanley Parable pulls the rug out from under you. For many I can imagine that just doesn't work. I've had a good laugh reading all the 0's that are posted here. Most are absolutely correct! But that's the point. The game is totally self-aware; and I almost feel like many of these 0s could be posted by the developers themselves as a form of meta-irony. The narrator of the game literally mocks the expectations of the gamers who play this with their built in understandings. In a way; many of these poor reviews are other stanleys who are having the joke played on them.The Stanley Parable calls into question the very meaning of what games are, in its narrative and existence. The game is self aware of both the 'interactive fiction' games like Dear Ester and the hyper game-play focused military FPS games.The Stanley Parable questions how any game can have meaningful choice, and yet presents the player with the most meaningful choices of any game ever created. The game recognizes almost everything you do; and takes great pride in pointing out how pointless your insistence of choice is on a designed game.It essentially points to one big conclusion about choice in games; and that is that choice in games is what you make of it.On a more aloof and intellectual level the game no doubt speaks to many aspects of social theory, including social constructivism, and also touches on logic, philosophy and psychology. If ever there was a game that could be held on a higher pedestal it is this one.On a 'should you but it, shouldnt you buy it' level: It should be pretty clear if this kind of game interests you. However it is definitely a game that cannot be ""tried"" ""demo'd"" and it certainly does not work just by watching the game. The vast majority is not just the spectacle or story; it's about the interaction between the player and the game designer. You cannot experience that by watching Let's Plays of the game, it simply does not capture the game properly.If you're on the fence, try the demo; it contains absolutely nothing of the full game but gives you a sense of it's tone.The Stanley Parable also makes it's younger half life 2 mod look like a rough draft in pencil; it bears the same name, but captures none of the greatness that makes this title an instant masterpiece.I hope this review helped you understand more about the Stanley Parable; if not then it doesn't matter, and that's the point.",fasterfasterfas

Anybody who did is obviously tampering with scores for a laugh. They may be trolling or simply hate the game but 0 is not a number for a game like the last of us*It is rare for me to find a game that moves me emotionally. Whether it be sadness or joy, this game has done it. Naughty dogs newest game is a pinnacle of storytelling, starting from a heart-breaking beginning to an ending that has been on my mind for weeks.Visually this game astounds me. The characters are so human and the environment, believable. The visuals enhance the fantastically violent nature of survival and at one time or another made me wince. This is not a negative factor however as it amazes me.The storyline granted is slightly cliché but just because someone did it before, doesn't mean it cant be done again. Not only was it done again but it exceeded any predictability with strong emotional connection to the characters and feelings of utter hopelessness at times. The gameplay is incredibly fun as no two battles need to be the same. Some argue that the game is linear but I argue back by saying ""its not linear, you just chose not to explore"". You have choices of weapons to modify and make and in doing so might help you or hinder you in the future. You need to plan ahead to survive.The soundtrack is beautiful and suits perfectly to the apocalyptic yet beautiful wasteland of America. The collapse of man of course caused by the cordyceps. basing a disease on a real life fungus adds to the believability that one day this could happen. The enemies in the game are split into hunters  melee. gunners, Molotov throwers, armoured) and the infected. the infected change through grotesque stages, each more deadly than the last. they are creative and very fun to kill.The only problem I found in the game was made to counteract an even greater one. your allies are sometimes invisible to the enemy until you are exposed. This sometimes breaks immersion but was done so that the whole game doesn't become one whole escort mission which it definitely is not. Some people may say that the enemy A.I is braindead. Some people give this game a 0 for this one reason. Some people are stupid.My verdict is that this game deserves all the praise it gets because it deserves it. It isn't overrated and certainly isn't bad. this game will be remembered for generation. This is for the Ps3 what Mario was for the NES. I will give this game a 10 although I don't believe any game is perfect. But until then very few games meet this standard.",nonbiased

Its ok when you need to go long distance and can fly over buildings but when you just need to get on top of a ledge or do precision-flying through streets the controls can be abit awkward. I also believe the maps should have labelled the names of characters as you hover their face, and the names of the different districts and buildings.

There is also capture the area (Most balanced) and a combination of the previous two game modes leading to a hybrid of sorts. All be told there are a whopping ... three game-modes to play in.As with most games where you're locked into a character with unique skills and attributes there are some  who are exceptionally strong and those that are .. well.. In need of a minor buff, some tanks don't feel 'tanky' at all and support characters that are capable of dishing out the pain like a pure dps character. Almost every match-up I've had so far (It is early days yet I'll give the game that) has almost everyone choosing the sniper/dps hero's leaving me to have to pick up the slack and choose the support and/or tank.Since all the Hero's have unique skills it follows that there is a champion who counters those skills and enables you to progress as a team, it becomes extremely monotonous when you have to rock paper scissor your way through a match, although you can buck the trend and have a team made up exclusively of one hero (Yes hero stacking is a thing, blizzard didn't learn from league of legends), which on some maps is extremely broken.It does have it's charm however, the characters are all quirky and interesting (If lacking in the lore department), some having that edgy, dangerous look about them others are charming and cute, while some are a combination of the two, all of which are rendered in a very beautiful, stylized graphics engine. You have various vanity unlocks for each of them, from in-game emotes, skins, lines they can say and various different sprays, there is enough useless junk to collect that would give Ubisoft games a run for it's money.All in all I would wait for the price to drop before purchasing this game, it's fun in short bursts but it has it's issues to say the least, but seeing as this is a blizzard game the price wont see a drop until sometime in the next decade.",Janosuk

69203,Super Mario Sunshine,GameCube,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        super mario 64 was great, but then after that, nintendo made a mario game that was very different than the others, super mario sunshine. Now this is one of my favorite mario games, but it's nothing like the regular games, it's probably the only mario game where the mushroom kingdom is not seen at all. So the plot is, mario is going on vacation to isle delfino And once ariving, he sees that the island is splattered with graffiti, after picking up FLUDD A water/backpack thing, they fight a giant graffiti Parana plant. after defeating this thing, the police take mario to court, after probably the most unfair court session i have ever seen, mario is sentenced to clean up the island. it turns out shadow mario (an evil version of mario) did the graffiti.  so now here's where the gameplay starts. the gameplay in super mario sunshine is just like super mario 64. you finish the level by finding a shine spite. now the first thing i have to say is that this game is HARD, probably the second hardest mario game ever behind super mario bros 2 lost levels. so anyway, all of the missions aren't the same goal. the levels in this game are called episodes, and you have to do something different every time to get a shine sprite. like, find all 8 red coins or, complete a secret level, This gameplay setup is very cool especially in a mario game of all things. now for the secret levels, the hardest and most frustrating part of the game,so what happens is shadow mario has taken FLUDD away from you and puts you in an obstacle course with the shine sprite at the end. these are hard, these are classic mario platforming but all of them are unnecessarily hard, you have to platform through these blocks that rotate, spin, and sometimes even push you off the level, I died about 100 times at the noki bay's secret level. one secret level even has these guys that throw you to the next platform and you have to aim perfectly or else they will throw you off the level. anyway, isle delfino has some of the best areas i have ever seen in a mario game, like serina beach, or the beautiful noki bay. and some levels are just amazing, there was this one level in gelato beach where you are on a giant bird made out of sand flying high in the sky, and in another platform up a hill in noki bay. oh, and did i mention that there are yoshis in the game, the first time yoshis are used in a 3D mario game, only thing is that it's not the original green yoshi, just other color yoshis. and after a boss fight it is revealed that shadow mario is bowser jr, that's a pretty good twist, and this is bowser jr's first appearance in a mario game. this game is very underrated, probably because this was the first time a nintendo console was released without a super mario game alongside it. this made fans want the best mario game ever. but this was a great game anyway.  the plot is great and has probably the best twist in any mario game, the levels are nice, the graphics are great, and the music is some of the best in the super mario series. It's probably my 2nd favorite super mario game.",classicgamer321

However, there was none at all. You start off (after some Jaw-dropping cut-scenes) with the most basic moves of ""Attack"" as the game teaches you about this new battle system. This lead me to run in a very straight line and fight battles again and again with no idea of the characters or the story. By chapter 3, thankfully, you begin to understand what the game is about. The boss fights are pretty epic and will keep you entertained, but the fight that get you there will wear you out a lot. The story more than makes up for this though.The game teaches you about the Paradigm System which changes a group of roles within a party. This makes you focus on switching between offensive and defensive strategies causing the battles to be a lot more fluid. I highly enjoyed this over the turn-based system I expected. It wasn't fun but it was tolerable. Mind you, you might not be able to play the game for more than an hour without it boring you.The story and graphics are what this game is made for. The story is dramatic and touching (but can go overboard at times) as well as great CG cut scenes which I looked forward to as well. A Data-log option also keeps you up to date with any confusion you have which helped me hugely half way through the game. It's a game that rewards you as you play more, however I hated the first 10 hours. As i went through it i was entertained by the personalities of the different characters and how real they felt. Vanille was hugely annoying though. She never shut up. This will probably be the only Final Fantasy game i will ever play and i really did enjoy it. Its a game that i will remember. The criticisms of this game really does confuse me but I guess we are all entitled to our opinion!",Adardar786

Score: 10.0[Gameplay]The moviment is fluid and Madeline is moving at a good speed (not as fast as in SMB and not as slow as N+). What surprises here is that the game brings obstacles and unique moves in each world. This left the game very creative and ends up with the chances of finding the game repetitive and annoying, since the whole gameplay is changing.Just a note here: Celeste is a binary game (with 8 directions, up, down, left, right and diagonals), so the ideal is to play Celeste in a d-pad. However, the Joy-Con Dpad is not very good for this purpose, and the Joy-Con analog is not very helpful, so be prepared to frustrate a bit.[History]I was surprised by this game to present a story and excellent dialogues between one chapter and another, since generally this type of game focuses only on the game and gives us a very empty story. Here Madeline has other battles, battles of which we identify.The narrative tells the story of a girl with the goal of climbing a mountain. On the way to the peak she finds a person warning of the dangers of this climb. Until then it's a clichéd little story giving any purpose for the game, because the protagonist does not even know the reason she wants to climb. However, in the course of the game we discover that these dangers are inside her, where she faces herself, bringing a deep and reflective narrative, making it one of the most important points of the game. Madeline wants to climb, but at the same time she thinks she's stupid enough to do something so impossible for her.[Sound]The soundtrack plays according to the action of the moment. I found the track to be fantastic with the scenery and challenges of each stage. In addition to the track, the game delivers a great set of sound effects, it seems every note has been carefully selected, each character even has its own ""8-bit timbre"" and this I thought was great![Challenge]Celeste is a difficult game, some phases we look at and think: it can not, without the condition of going from there. But we try, try and try and you can. The game is very conducive to trial and error because dying does not bring any punishment and in less than 3 seconds you are already there trying that stretch again. Also, the stages are short, I would say that in 20s you can go through each phase (not considering the deaths), one or the other is a little bigger.Another positive aspect here are almost unique challenges, the game don't keep putting the same obstacles and the same solutions all the time, so the repetitive gameplay is practically zero.[Duration]The main campaign can finish in a thing from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., it depends a lot on your performance in each stage. But the collectibles turn those 6h into more at least 25h, and can reach 50h. So if you seek to do everything in the game, you will need a lot of time and patience.[Graphics]The graphics are good, it has good special effects, but there is nothing extraordinary here. I feel that the team has the ability to deliver something bigger in the graphics just as they surprised the other aspects of the game, but this was to be desired.[Conclusion]10/10! Celeste is by far the best platform game of recent times. It's a must play!",bbcbreno

168097,Gone Home,PC,5,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        The game gone home it`s about a girl named Kaitlin Greenbriar and her empty house. Kaitlin returns from Europe and found out that no one it`s home. Samanta`s letter hang on the door, and Kaitlin will later find out where her sister and family is. Kaitlin have to find the keyhouse and escape the whole house to find out what just happened to her sister Samantha, her mom Janice and her father Terrence.Gone Home was a very interesting game at the beginning. Graphics in the game was a bit scary because all the colours was a bit dark. All the sounds in the game was a bit creepy, I can hear when Kaitlin walk, opened the doors and much more. Sound and the graphics combined together very well. That makes the game seems and sounds interesting and a bit scarier than I thought. Gone home was a bit sad because her sister Samantha has no friends except her best friend Loonie, and they ends up to be girlfriend/boyfriend. In the house, there was many secret rooms and secret doors, that was very interesting for me. Personally I mean the length of the game was not long enough and the ending was so badly. I just got opened Samantha's book and the game was just done already. In the kitchen I think I saw a calendar, the parents went one week on holiday to a wedding when Kaitlin finally came home. Samantha was just gone, and i don't know 100% where she is and what had happened to her. So that's the whole reason why the ending of the game was bad. Kaitlins parents should die and be a very scary, dangerous ghost or zombie. In that way, the game should be very god.I mean that we should play something adventure games like this gone home again, because I like it. Normal english lessons there we have to write much and read in the books it's not fun. It's much funnier and better when we can play games with a partner or alone.

The substitution menu is much harder to use than in previous years but once you get used to it, it isn't all that bad. Also, VC is much harder to use this year as part of EA's never ending conquest to take as much money from their fans as possible. The MyCareer storyline is kind of interesting but if your goal is to play with real NBA players then you will be disappointed because there are two made up players and one of them will follow you even if you are traded and the other will dominate the league whether you are on the same team or not. I regret purchasing this game for the opening price of $60 because it is basically a roster update with worse gameplay. Wait for a price drop if you really want it and don't waste money on the VC because EA will continue to milk this cash cow and make it even harder to earn VC next year.

Not only was the combat way more improved, but now you got a greater percentage of villians to fight and an entire barricaded city to fully explore.

Both truly added to their characters and pulled it off quite well which was satisfying indeed. The inclusion of more villians to tackle this time as well was cool too.

I really found myself impressed seeing all of the characters all in one game and involved in a rather interesting story.With all the good I have one minor issue and that is the inclusion of Catwoman.

There is a startling contrast between the maturity of the setting and the immaturity of the narrative. Naturally, it is difficult to discuss this without giving away too much. But players (especially older ones), may be disappointed with the numerous cheap plot twists and thin characters. The ending feels especially half-arsed.

Some idiot at Bioware for some reason decided to remove mission tracking in journal entries, so we never know how far we are in a certain mission! There does feel like a bit of Michael Bay EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE action going off here, but despite this it would have been nicer to see all out battles going on rather than linear small skirmishes. Now, the ending. Yes, it was bad. It was an A, B, or C option like we were explicitly promised would not happen.

It was nice to see my rogue just kill stuff with style. The spells and skills look nice, First time i casted rock armor i was amazed how much better it looked compared to DA:O. The new Qunari look nice, but in the game you dont see any female Qunari's also you dont see any female Dwarfs. The dialogue wheel is something they tried to take over from ME2, but it dosent fit for DA2. In a rpg i wanna be the character and choose what i say like i did in DA:O, but with the new dialogue wheel i often felt like i didnt bother reading any options. Making me pay less attention to the story. I always knew top was good, middle was neutral and bottom was evul. So i always clicked the top one and didnt bother reading anything else. Which was a huge letdown. In DA:O you had so many diffrent choices and you chose the option which felt what you would have said so you were thinking what you would do, you were in the game. Also the dialogue options were sometimes confusing, because i hoped it to say something diffrent and it kept me sometimes wondering if i pressed something wrong or could the other options say what i wanted to say.Companions:Companion customization is dumbed down. You can't change ur companion armor, except rings,necklace, belt and weapon. In a rpg i always want to customize all my characters. Or maybe it was too much to expect. 1 and half years to make a sequal isnt that much, comparing to DA:O and i guess Bioware didnt have the time to make armors for your companions. But not being able to change armors, resulted my main character who was a rogue, have more armor/defence than my tank. Even though you can upgrade your companion armors, by getting some special upgraders or doing companion quests it isnt as effective compared to DA:O, where you could give them your old set.Another thing about companions, you cant talk to them everytime you want. Basically if you want to know about them you need to wait for the companion quest to open. I always was checking all my companions, because i wanted to know about them more, but i never was able to talk with them unless they had a quest and that wasnt really what i was looking forward to. In DA:O you could talk with them everywhere, which was great, but now the only chance to talk with them is during companion quests and occasionaly cutscenes. In DA:O, you talked with them everytime gave them gifts, laughed at their jokes and dialogues, but now it feels like they removed it from the game. True the companions to have funny dialogue with eachother from time to time, but here i don't bother listening to them at all, unless its Varrick whos talking. Varrick will probably be the companion i will remeber. Compared to DA:O, where i loved Alistair, Morrigan, Shale, Zevran, Oghren and so on. The companions in DA2 arent that memorable.The theme is Kirkwall, you spend all the time in Kirkwall and its surrounding places. Kirkwall is a huge city and you can choose to visit at night and day, which is nice, but the city is empty. I mean there arent npc-s. The huge city seems kinda empty, but that isnt a big problem, the biggest problem is the dungeons and recycled areas. After ACT1 you will spend ur time revisiting the places u visited for several more times. Basically after ACT1 you have seen the whole game. Compared to DA:O, where there were so many diffrent places, citys this seems like they didnt have money or the time to make new dungeons. After revisiting a dungeon the 20-th time you know where the most treasures are and it isnt as rewarding and the game lacks exploration.What is the deal with DLC before the game is even released. They are trying to milk too much money out of the gamers who like the Dragon Age universe. There are 2 dlc-s already, which 1 has a new companion and the other has some bonus items. You can play DA2 without dlc-s easily, because those dlc don't add that much depth to the game. Also on hard/nightmare the game is challenging, however some places are unbalanced and make you wanna tear your hair out. To play on nightmare you gotta exploit all the weakness and the stupidness of the enemys ai. The game started feeling like hit and run. The game isnt as tactical as DA:O, yes you can play it tactically, but after waves and waves of enemys ur tactics mostly end up being useless, because enemy's come out of nowhere and just take out ur mage or rogue. So you never can be prepeared.Dont get me wrong Dragon Age 2 is a good game, but i always kept comparing it to DA:O. DA2 was rushed out, it wasnt polished like DA:O. If there wasnt DA:O i would give DA2 a score of 8, but it felt for me that it isnt as good as DA;O and i always compared to it. So imma give it a 7.0",wiwefak

I went back to dark souls 1 and tested out the hitboxes in pvp and to my surprise the hitboxes were actually accurate i wasnt getting hit by wepons that were out of range , so my question is, why is an outdated ps3 2011 dark souls 1 able to have better pvp hitboxes than a 2016 ps4  dark souls 3? It just baffles me. Also there is an extreme lack of build diversity , all you will see is players using greatswords, straight swords and dark sword  and the fact that fromsoft rehashed everything from dark souls 1 just shows there wasnt much thought put into this game they reused patches , siegmeyer , darkmoon covenant ( which still does not work even after they patched it btw) sunbros covenant , dragon covenant , anor londo , almost every weapon and armor from dark souls 1 and 2 . If you want to play this be my guest , no doubt you will enjoy it at first but once you beat the game numerous times and spend alot of time in pvp you will start to realize that this is just an attempt at making a dark souls 1 clone , i am glad this is the last game in the series for now , this should have never been developed  .",Steven105

274007,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning,PlayStation3,9,"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning provides the most fun I've had in a fantasy RPG since the 16-bit era.

It has already been compared to The Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, Fable, and even Dark Souls, but frankly, I think it feels more like an evolution of hack-n-slash action RPGs like Diablo or Champions of Norrath, albeit with much deeper role-playing mechanics than you normally get from those games.  The focus is obviously on combat, which borrows heavily from the Devil May Cry lineage (God of War, Bayonetta, etc.).  With loot waiting to be snagged around every corner and after every battle, you can quickly build a character in any direction, and weapon-armor loadouts make an enormous difference in how that character handles.  You also don't need to worry about experimenting with a set of skills, since you always have the option of wiping the slate clean or simply shifting your focus to a different set of abilities.  Destiny cards then allow you to buff your character out with stat enhancements that match your desired focus, kind of like a flexible class system.  You can easily create a magic-using rogue or a wizard with a longsword on standby, pretty much any combination you can dream up.  There's no shortage of content, either, since the game's story quests and optional missions easily add up to 200+ hours.  You can buy houses to store your junk, restore your health, and allow makeover options, and these residences can be upgraded in a variety of ways.  There's also a day-night cycle that impacts NPC/enemy activity as well as adding some pretty environmental effects to the lush environments, though no dynamic weather is present like it is in Skyrim.  On that subject, many players have criticised Amalur's level design for being more restrictive than Skyrim's, but in my opinion, the inability to cross mountains or go whereever you please adds to the brilliance of the map layout.  Every area is designed in a memorable way, and getting from one place to the other can be a sort of environmental puzzle, more like classic 16-bit RPGs than the recent open-world trend.  I see that as a positive, since it not only illustrates greater focus on design but also makes it a challenge to get from one side of the map to the other.  You'll need to meet quest requirements, defeat bosses, and gain key items to access some of the coolest locales, and considering the intelligence of some enemy mobs, that provides a real sense of accomplishment.  It's not Dark Souls, by any stretch, but if you fancy yourself a strong gamer, I would highly encourage playing on Hard, as Normal mode can seem too easy for veterans of the genre.  Like Dark Souls, though, battles require a bit of strategy and precise strikes, but all of it is much faster and more forgiving than Souls.  This game really is meant for fans of loot, combat, and exploration, and it does all of these elements very well.  The only shortcomings are its minor technical flaws (mostly in glitchy audio) and its fairly standard fantasy lore/plot.  The scripting and scenario writing isn't bad within those confines, though, since R.A. Salvatore provided most of the storytelling.  Also, Todd McFarlane's artistic direction is cool, but it's much lighter-hearted than some of his comic book and action figure designs, resembling a more detailed World of Warcraft or Fable-esque aesthetic.  Even the game's controls are a little like Fable, but again, Reckoning is clearly the more advanced evolution between the two.  All in all, I would actually call Reckoning my favorite fantasy RPG of this generation, above Skyrim or Dragon Age: Origins, but considering it satisfies a different set of criteria than either of those games, it can co-exist with your other favorites just fine.  Buy it for its fun factor.  Buy it for its unique mixture of elements from other RPG heavyweights.  Buy it because it's the first time we've seen God of War combat in an action RPG, and frankly, I want more!",JPoppaWUSC

This is truly one of the best games in the past decade, and one of the few ""epic"" games ever. No - I am not giving it a 10, because for one it is much too short, for two the max level is WAY too low except if you DLC, which is **** and for three the games posses after all these years game breaking bugs, which if screwed up and would never have been tolerated if it had been a japanese title.",jim109109

ThenOkay, this game is just AWFUL. And this is coming from someone who spent over 100 hours on it and beat the game on Inferno with my Wizard so I've given the game more than its fair chance. The first couple of times of beating the game are very fun, especially with friends, I will hand it to Blizzard. The art is nice, the music is not bad, and the environments are somewhat interesting. Then you reach the brick wall that is known as Inferno (the hardest difficulty) and you realize what Blizzard has been planning all along.The mobs in Inferno suddenly become godlike and all your gear becomes instantly obsolete. Elites and even regular mobs will kick your ass unless you upgrade your very quickly. To make matters worse the game PUNISHES YOU for playing co-op on Inferno, the already disgustingly difficult mobs become near godly and unless you and your friends are supremely geared it's going to be an excruciating exercise in futility. Problem is that 95% of the loot you get in Inferno is literally garbage, so bad that even the NPC vendors will be reluctant to accept them. Magic find increases the chances of getting yellow items, but chances are they are still crap. There are far too many possible attributes during item rolls, so as a result you will almost always get items which make no sense whatsoever (example: Wizard hat with Strength, or Barbarian sword with Intelligence, etc.) and weapons in Act 4 of Inferno with 200 DPS. It's infuriating. It is so bad that when I killed Diablo on Inferno he dropped only blues, and not just any blues but TERRIBLE blues, stuff so bad you wouldn't even use it on Hell difficulty.So you're thinking to yourself, WHY WHY WHY would they do this?! Why make the mobs so difficult and the gear so bad?!?!WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE REACH THE GOAL OF BLIZZARD'S GAME DESIGN IN DIABLO 3: THE REAL MONEY AUCTION HOUSE!!!As stated Inferno is so ridiculously difficult and the loot generally so bad that the ONLY WAY to progress is to use the Auction House. I only managed to beat the game by bidding low gold on items and shopping intelligently, but it took wayyyy longer than it should have. Not only this, I was BASICALLY FORCED TO USE THE AUCTION HOUSE TO BEAT THE GAME. Trust me this isn't just unique to me because I suck, 90% of my friends gave up at Inferno Act 1, those that stayed have had no choice but to use the Auction House as well. The game isn't skill dependent, it is only gear based.PROBLEM IS that the gold prices of items have flown through the roof due to inflation, botters, and exploiters. So expect to see any half decent weapon for at least 10 million gold, which is no small amount of money. So a lot of people have resorted to using the Real Money Auction House and it's absolute chaos. I've seen people spending over $500 (yes real cash) on a SINGLE ITEM, a virtual item folks that will probably be obsolete in the next patch or expansion. I personally don't believe in spending real money on video game items (especially absurd amounts like stated above) but to each his own. -----So I really can't help but feel like the entire game was designed to revolve around the Real Money Auction House. The difficulty is absurd at inferno, many of the bosses are basically gear-checks (can only be beaten with certain amounts of DPS) and the loot is so bad that you have no choice but to use the Auction House.This game is a money grab, it's pay to win, and I'm not sticking around for when they implement Player vs. Player where it's going to be the battle of the credit cards.I will admit that I got more than my money's worth and it was fun at times, but this franchise has been ruined and this is by FAR the worst Blizzard game I have ever played.

Mass Effect 2 is the reason I can say that video games are beginning to have the same impact that movies have on an audience. Throughout the game, fighting and conversing with my squad, I really began to feel for some of my teammates. I finished the game awestruck and wished that I could have made some different choices beforehand to save some of my dead squad. My only complaint is that I felt the story should have focused more on the main mission at hand; maybe added a couple more important decisions and an extra quest before heading through the Omega 4 Relay. Also I wish the final battle had been longer; all that build up for an amazingingly put together but short lived close. Nevertheless I still cannot believe that I was so pulled into this game and how breathtaken I was as it ended, I didnt want it to end.I still cant stop thinking about the incredible battle sequences and cutscenes.

I think the main problem is that the developers tried to combine a sand box style game with straight forward shooter elements. In a shooter, constant combat is exactly what you want, but in a sandbox game, it's nice to be able to explore or travel to and from missions without getting attacked or feeling like you have to creep along the road and around each outpost.

I am in love with this game. It combines my love for Real life Nordic people with the awesome Elder Scrolls lore. I was blown away with the opening scene, simply amazing. The gameplay is awesome. I really like how peoples heads track you when you move around them. As if they're real people. The AI is pretty good in my opinion. I feel like I'm actually part of their world and they are not just there for me to talk to, or kill. The terrain is pretty accurate as well. beautiful pines, birches and aspens. beasts that actually look like real world beasts. The first time I seen a dog and a child, I was like, about time! Though there were dogs in TES:IV they looked rather bland. The dogs are very life like in this game.  I love the crafting that they have brought into the game. you can make every piece of gear or kit you'll ever need in game.  From armor to swords and potions to a salmon steak. Mining, skinning, chopping wood, fishing. All very awesome.Now on for my very small complaint. The IU is terrible, much rather have the oblivion or a hybrid of the Fallout UI than this one. As well as the mouse speed. Even on the fastest setting the mouse tracking is slow.  Your arms and armor to not receive any damage, which I got a little disheartened about after seeing such amazing blacksmith set ups throughout the game. I was hoping that there would be a cross over from the Fallout series where you could use two of the same items to repair one and etc. As for leveling up and skills. This was kind of hard to figure out but after a few level ups I started to get the hang of it. As for combat, I'm getting rather tired of my followers getting in my way and taking a blow from my axe instead of my enemies. I hope there is a way I can fix this later on in game (a perk perhaps?) or someone makes a mod to fix the problem. Also, The only challenge I seem to get is by fighting giants and mammoths. Everyone else is usually dead in 2-4 hits without me getting less that 90% hp in damage. Well, this is my person opinion about this game. I have enjoy it very much so far and plan on having many more hours of fun with it, I'm not even 10% done with it as I've been exploring and taking in the wonder views. Amazing job Bethesda. I only wish that I could have afforded that $2,000 gaming PC I wanted for this game and the collectors edition.",jshkorn

The only complaint I have is that I wish it were longer.  It's a bit short, but for a downloadable game that is to be expected.  This game represents what video games should be.  After being let down by most modern games due to their mindless, button-mashing gameplay...this game gives me hope that someone out there is still interested in making a good game.  I was more impressed with this downloadable game than the full-priced games you buy in the store.  So much more thought was put into this game than most big-budget modern day games.  Most games today try to distract you with big set pieces, explosions, and dialogue...meanwhile their gameplay is dull, mindless, and repetitive. Limbo is the opposite of that. Limbo follows in the tradition of legendary side-scrolling puzzlers like Oddworld, Flashback, and Out of This World.  I recently downloaded the original Oddworld: Abe's Odysee from PSN and was blown away by that game....but after finishing Oddworld I was depressed because I though that in today's gaming landscape no one would ever have the balls to make another game like Oddworld.  Well the makers of Limbo have proven me wrong.  this game is masterfully DESIGNED....every aspect of the environment is carefully designed to force you to use your brain and figure out how to get from point A to point B...Most modern games are not designed thoughtfully - most modern game developers simply create environments that have no purpose but to look cool, then they throw you into the environment and expect you do nothing but mash buttons and shoot things...in most games you are never required to solve problems...but Limbo was designed with care and intent. Someone finally had the guts to make a game that requires you to think....someone finally took the time to design a game with purpose...that game is Limbo.",skim123

I've heard many say that ALttP is their favorite Zelda because many of the elements in future installments derive from it. But just because a game possesses elements(Takes a deep breath...) All right, here we go. I think A Link to the Past is slightly overrated. Not to say I think its bad, but I would consider it a weaker Zelda title today. I don't even think I'd put it in my top 5 list. I've heard many say that ALttP is their favorite Zelda because many of the elements in future installments derive from it. But just because a game possesses elements that future games will build upon doesn't mean that it is the best. In fact, such a game should grow worse as the series progresses. Though ALttP has aged considerably well, it falls into this category.So what do I not like about ALttP? Well, setting aside my taste in art styles, I can't say I hate anything about the game. Granted, the dungeons don't have much variety in style and the music tends to drone on, but other than that it's a solid game. The combat is fun and exploration is nearly perfect. I suppose the one thing that bugs me the most is how the game establishes itself through its story. The story is considerably basic and still maintains the feeling that it's an 8-bit game, where story wasn't relied heavily on. But with games nowadays, and even back in the 16-bit era with games like Chrono Trigger, story is one of the biggest driving points for the player. Games can't afford to have an uninteresting set of characters or atmosphere now that so much more is expected out of them.While this game is a classic in every sense of the word, I can't get over the feeling that I'm playing a dated game every time I play it. While it certainly deserves praise for what it has done for the franchise and will not be forgotten, I simply cannot call it one of the best.

It has a current metacritic score of 86/100 and is a seriously fun game. It features full dual monitor support (each screen in showing a different location, eg. one on your base and the other the front line, or whatever you like. very handy for an RTS) The default population cap is 1000 units per player.The expansion Forged Alliance adds new gameplay features to the game, several new units for the three preexisting factions, and is further optimized for increased performance.Gameplay in Forged Alliance is largely the same as in the original Supreme Commander. The player uses a giant bipedal mech called an Armored Command Unit (or ACU) to build an army with which they can conquer their opponents. Forged Alliance expands on the original gameplay mechanics, adding new units, modifying old ones, and introducing other improvements to the user interface.[4] The most notable addition to this expansion is the addition of a new faction, the Seraphim. In addition, the three original factions  the United Earth Federation (UEF), Cybran Nation, and Aeon Illuminate  also receive a number of new units. Other new content includes new maps. Several improvements to the controls and behind the scenes mechanics have been made as well. The interface has been revamped, as well as improved pathfinding and aircraft flight dynamics.[4]The original Supreme Commander allowed the player to employ all four traditional battlespaces  air, information, land and sea. Forged Alliance adds the ability for the UEF faction to construct orbital weaponry which the player can control. These satellites are impossible to harm directly, forcing opponents to find and destroy the control centers maintaining them.Guys, you should really play this game.

I've read through probably hundreds of reviews before deciding to spend my hard earned cash on this game, mainly because I was so dissapointed with the previous GTA IV.  I have never seen so much high praise for a game, ever.  I have also never seen so much hopeless and useless bashing of a game (more on that in a moment).  All of the things I felt needed fixing in GTA IV, they fixed, especially the driving mechanics.  The first few hours I spent playing GTA V, were some of the most fun I've EVER had playing a game.  Fantastic player control, humorous, well executed and convincing commentary, incredible ambient sound and amazing music.  The graphics are incredibly polished and like others have said, quite an accomplishment for the 360.  Many people are bashing this game for seemingly pointless reasons.  Some, because they want attention, some because of jealousy and some because they are just hopelessly ignorant.  I say look at user score distribution.  Even the people trying their best to pull the rating down for ratings sake are still failing as of this review.  Finally, I will confirm as I have read again and again in the last few days that this IS one of the best games ever made and quite possibly the best game that i've played in my life.  That is spanning 24 years of gaming, 12+ systems and hundreds of games.  The Cake is Done.  Enjoy!",arcon2

Wolfenstein 2 is particularly disappointing when you compare it to games like Doom or the last Wolfenstein.Frankly, the cut scenes are excessively long, unnecessarily so. Then there’s the issue I have with the disgusting SJW, anti white, anti “straight white male” and blatant pro communism agenda. I wasn’t part of the initial “outrage” from a while back. It’s apparent now that, in true SJW Leftist form, criticisms of this game’s obvious agenda was dishonestly mischaracterized. Criticism of Wolfenstein 2 was dishonestly equated to “I cant believe these racist white devils are mad that you kill Nazis in this game”. That isn’t and never has been a thing. I’m sure there are ignorant, naive people who didn’t look into it and just accepted the misinformation or outright lies being lobbed at anyone who dared to criticize Wolfenstein 2’s “story” (agenda).“Just who the **** are you whiteboy?” - Sister Grace“Well, you ain’t a white a** fascist Nazi pig, then you either colored or you’re a deviant.” (I.e, All white people are Nazis or deviants.) “You sure as h*ll ain’t colored so you trying to pass as a deviant? He look like a deviant to you, Sister Grace?” - Super Spesh (white guy)“ Come and f***ing get me you white a** Nazi pigs.“ - BJ Blazkowicz (white guy)We’ve been fighting every mother****ing day Blazkowicz. White America though?! Ha, they done packed up and given in. See. I guess they don’t have the fighting spirit no mo. Nah, the just do whatever the ****ing Fuhrer tells em to do.” - Sista GraceThere’s the 8+ month pregnant Mary Sue, Anya Oliwa. Anya’s super hero level fighting skills are exhibited in one bizarre scene where she strips off all her clothes and obliterates a room full of Nazis/Panzerhounds while dual wielding machine pistols covered in their blood. At one point she belly flops onto her fully developed pregnant belly, shields BJ from a Grenada she throws.To be clear, I have no problem with exceptionally strong female protagonists. Horizon Zero Dawn, the Tomb Raider franchise and the Last Of Us are at the top of my list of favorite games.

Finished the Single Player Campaign and have not even touched the Co-op, but after seeing the awesome ending of this game I felt compelled to write a review about it.  In this review I would like to set some things straight.First of all, the game is not as short as some people are saying it is.  People that are saying they beat the game in 2 - 4 hours are LYING.  There is no way you can beat the game that fast.  The single player took me 12 hours to beat.  Now that's considering that I like to take my time and listen to all the FUNNY dialogue this game has.  If I rushed it though I probably could have beaten it in about 7 - 9 hours.Did I mention the game is FUNNY?  This is probably the funniest game I have ever played in my life.  I have never laughed out loud so many times in a game as I did in this one.  J.K. Simmons and Stephen Merchant deserve metals.I have seen some people say that the game was too easy, but for me the difficulty was perfect.  (maybe they're geniuses with 150 IQs and I'm a dumbass)  I honestly don't care I just had fun.  In some of the harder chambers I would walk around and not know what to do.  After messing around for some time the solution would suddenly hit me.  And I would think ""I can't believe I didn't think of that sooner"".  I would then solve the puzzle and feel a little sense of accomplishment.  The game has an excellent learning curve, and if you can visualize yourself solving the puzzle you can execute it.  The puzzles are not as dexterity based as some of the ones in portal.I've heard people say the game has dated graphics which is odd because to me the game had excellent graphics.  The source engine still looks great and runs so smooth.  60 fps on the highest settings (no crashes) and I just have a medium powered graphics card (GTS 250).  One thing I appreciate about valve games is that the games run so smooth and look so great on less powerful machines.And about the DLC robot Store.  No one is forcing you to buy anything. End of story.  Get over it.  I can't believe there are people giving the game a 0 solely for that. To conclude.  Thank you GABEN and Valve for making yet another awesome game!

Everything from the environments to the little objects you find strewn everywhere, to the surreal experience of listening to swing music as you obliterate zombies adds to the impressive ambiance of the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout 3. While I have not played the first two in the series, this game has drawn me in like very few can, it is among such games as Legend of Zelda and Mass Effect in that area. This is one of the few games where the player can actually get emotionally invested in the characters and the plot. While I will not give spoilers, suffice it to say that there are plenty of moments that made me want to laugh, cry, and even throw things at my TV. One moment in particular created a feeling of complete helplessness, something I have never felt in a video game. The sheer variety of weapons is one of the most pleasant surprises, especially those which you cobble together using schematics found throughout the world. Most of the custom weapons have an odd fusion of new tech and old tech, especially the Railway Rifle, a modified hunting rifle-type weapon that fires railroad spikes. Every weapon is satisfying and fun to use. For added fun, check out the ""Bloody Mess"" perk, if you can for added combat entertainment.

Not where Mass Effect 1 left off, mind you, but with a clear break because Shepard and his/her famous ship Normandy get zapped to tiny bits by the latest threat to the Galaxy only to be reconstituted by the nefarious Cerberus organisation, headed by that sinister individual called the Illusive Man for gargantuan amounts of money.This little trick is needed to make sure that the new enemy isn't dealt with at once, because with Shepard's powers, high reputation, influential Spectre status and team of experts the end mission could have gotten underway from the start. So instead, Shepard is killed and Shepard is resurrected to start the game with a clean slate so you can gain it all again. Unfortunately someone must have listened to Sympathy for the Devil once too often and and hooked up the hero of the galaxy with the biggest evil organisation of the galaxy for no reason at all. Yes, it is that bad: as in writing as well as in situation.The story is dreadful. A big flaw is how it fails to uphold its own moral system. ME2 uses Kotor's light side/dark side system translated into paragon and renegade. It reduces decisions to 'right' or 'wrong' options, depending on what the creators deem is 'right' or 'wrong' in a given situation. A third option does not afford any awards. Just like with Kotor: being neutral is the worst state to be in.An example how bad this is handled in ME 2 is the scene were you run into a bunch of looters, lecture them about stealing from the dead while you ransacked apartments down the corridors before and will do so after. You actually get rewarded for being a hypocrite.Another example: you get rewarded for convincing a company to buy a slave, even though that company is against slavery. Well done.I do not advocate a moral compass, but ME2 insists on it and it makes a mockery out of it. This is what makes ME2 at the core a flawed story.But the issues run even deeper.You are forced to serve one of the worst organisation in the galaxy whose methods and tactics haven't changed much as far as you can tell, but now you happen to be working for it. Your fellow crew members have no moral problems serving a criminal organisation, one that is known to have experimented on humans including children, not because out of loyalty for you - because everyone though you were dead - but because of any lame excuse that can explain away their lack of integrity.When it becomes clear that the human colony Horizon was offered as bait by Cerberus, without the Illusive Man informing you beforehand, you don't even get the option to leave. And if you are tricked again by him with the Collector Ship mission, you still can't leave the organisation.The writers of this game did the most terrible thing one can imagine on a player, they stripped the player of the illusion of freedom of choice. After the collector ship, neither a renegade like Snake Plisken nor a paragon like Aragorn would have stayed. Nobody would have been take for a ride twice, but for you, because the writers force you to.Piss poor writing is at every corner. Take Miranda's personal quest. In her quests one of her trusted friends betrays her to a bunch of mercenaries merely because she wasn't upfront about her sister to him. Years of friendship down the drain by one single incident. And he doesn't even confront her with his feelings first, but instead sells out her sister to someone he doesn't even know. Because that is how people think in the skewed world of Mass Effect.Terrible terrible terrible writing..Without a good story what is left is a game that allows you to fight spawned monsters with a team of three. For those who like shooters it will feel like a drag, especially as there are no fast buttons to switch between weapons or no way to dash. At higher difficulty levels you run into ammunition shortages, which means that you have to rely more on powers, which makes battles last longer and drawn out. At least one avatar becomes useless at higher levels because her powers don't work on armored or shielded enemies. And they all are. The AI is terrible. Enemies consists mostly of three kinds. Small ones that swarm, normal ones that hang in the back and big ones that charge at you to use their overwhelming firepower to hammer you down.The fun part is perhaps to try out various combinations of powers and team members in various settings and to explore the personal missions of some, if not all of your team mates. But don't be surprised if you forgot what it all was about as it doesn't really matter. And don't worry: there is always a big sign pointing which way to go. You can't miss it. And even if you do miss it, it will force itself on you eventually.",MeritCoba

Generally it is disappointing because combat is the worst thing about this game. After playing around 10 hours I have been frustrated by it a number of times.Ammo is scarce and PC's miss most of their shots unless you spend heavily in combat skills, which means you neglect the massive number of other useful skills which make up parts of the game which are actually fun. Melee weapons beyond a nail board seem to be completely forgotten.Most of the fights, save a few, seem to be standoffs with little in the way of tactical cover, rather two teams blasting at each other until one crew dies. This is a major let down. Even setting up ambushes becomes a tedious tip-toe forward trying not to aggro the enemy, who can run at you like Usain Bolt and get into melee range on their first turn. There is no kind of CC or even debuffs.Loot is randomly generated apart from medical supplies and some mobs. You can easily get starved of one type of ammo so the pressure is on throughout the game to conserve as much as you can.The story is quite good so far, with a hard choice early on with real consequences. The dialogue is well acted and written, although sometimes you will want to turn the radio transmitter spam off so you can actually focus on your story.The ""isometric"" (3D) view is great, although the graphics in general lack a real polish, looking much like the first ""Dawn of War"" game which came out 10 years ago this month. The maps are exactly like the old Fallout games or even New Vegas, mostly brown but with some fun variations on the theme. The sizes are fine and walking them does not take too long. Loading times between maps were around 10-15 seconds for me. I have not found any bugs.There is a lot to like about this game, and like Divinity Original Sin its probably more fun with a guide on how to set your party up (which I think is a really lame thing). The combat is tiresome but the dramatic parts are good and the environment is what you would probably want. I don't think it is worth £30, if you liked fallout wait for it to be £20.",123456

Many of the N64 era of gamers consider this to be one of the greatest games ever made.

Is this game still to be considered the best game ever made? Or is nostalgia a greater factor than the actual aspects of the game? Well, many die hard Zelda fans may be dismayed to hear this, but nostalgia is a HUGE factor of whether or not gamers will feel that this game is still amazing. Players who have never played OoT before this are surely going to love the story, the music, and the exploration and atmosphere, but may not feel it is one of the best games of all time. But as for the many of us who fell in love with the original, this is the same game, plain and simple. The 3ds specific features are overall enjoyable, but not game changing or breaking for that matter. the gyroscopic controls are a surprisingly well implemented idea. The 3D effect adds depth, and definitely has some moments that actually pop from the screen, however, again, it isn't game changing or necessary. Like it or not, OoT is just as amazing now as it was in 98. With the revamped graphics, the master quest, boss rush, and optional hints for newer players, this game is surely deserving of the attention of anyone who enjoys video games.",Botswana

Personally, I would choose Nohr logically, to attempt to thwart King Garon from behind his back, but this path also interested me because it includes 3 characters from Awakening!The only reason I'm not giving this a 10/10 is because I thought the map design was too simple, where you just choose the level you want to play from a list, rather than exploring the map and getting to know where exactly everything is.

It is very rare that a game is found with this level of graphics, game play and world size, especially from 2010. Games even from this era are dwarfed in map size. the area of play is 643.4 square miles and it takes 10 minutes to cross by jet and about 30 to cross by parachute and grappling hook. This brings me to the mechanics. It is surprising that no franchise before has thought of the combination of a grappling hook and parachute, but even if they had, it would be put to shame by the detailed way this is done in the game. This is the kind of thing that exposes endless possibility. you can not only pull yourself immense distances with a single grapple, but you can also tether two objects together. I like to ride on the top of a 747 while it is taking off, tether it to the ground and abandon ship. the problem of handling vehicle destruction is pulled of by instead, making everything explode. I have played the game for about three weeks, and clocked in about 30 hours, and it is still relentlessly fun. While the missions are terribly boring, it is always fun to find the most creative way to pull it off. In a select mission, I had to destroy multiple generators inside buildings. grenades weren't getting the job done, so I bought a cluster bomb launcher, launched it inside, and ran.

Yes, Bioware should've foreseen the fallout of the DLC, and just released it as part of the game. Corporate world; welcome to it. It's not like this is uncommon these days in the industry (or any industry). However, I think lamentations of the writing issues and gameplay have been blown out of proportion. When I finished the game I was quite disappointed since I don't think I've played a game with higher expectations. My main issues were the stub of a story they called the main plot. I did reach 25 hours or so of singleplayer gameplay, but a lot of it was chasing war assets in every cluster of the universe. Also, the half-hearted ending that made me feel like my 100 or so hours of ME gameplay were wasted. Multiplayer is not required for the best ending. I played 25 hours of singleplayer and got the best possible ending, though admittedly collecting war assets was quite tedious. They could've done more with the characters; I only lost Kaidan in ME1, yet, felt like all my efforts saving my team were useless since I saw some characters only a few times. The new party member they add is a complete joke, a dead-end of a character. However this game is not a 0 out of 10. Anyone who rated a 0 is someone who underwent the same feeling of disappointment I did then just lashed back. Story-wise, definitely the worst game of the series. Characters come and go in a blur; relationships consist of just a few conversations. Gameplay-wise, however, ME3 is much better in my opinion. Harder fights, more varied enemies, smarter enemies, more organic-feeling powers. More customization than ME2, thankfully, but also thankfully less than the smothering options in ME1. Environments were very varied, as were the situations. Multiplayer is just coop wave gameplay over and over again, but the combat is good enough that I'm finding myself playing a lot of multiplayer and still not getting bored, as are thousands of others. I don't expect to log that much more time on multiplayer, but it'll last me longer than such a simple system should, and that is because of the excellent combat. I am still a great fan of the series though this one dropped the ball a little. I'm considering another playthrough from the very start.

The level design is great and looks beautiful, as with the predecessor there's no grid, making the routes feel like real, natural places, and making you put more thought in how to find its hidden secrets. Catching all pokemon, training them, battling, breeding, all seems tweaked to make them more pleasant to do. the QoL changes were massive and the region is better, including an extra trial to do.There's new things to do that can expand immensely your play-time even if you don't care about on-line trades and battles, from small add-ups like letting you play and interact with wild pokemon or having more z-crystals to find and collect, to bigger time-sinkers, like how you can:-literally surf on top of a pokemon to compete for the highest score in multiple tracks-find hidden secrets everywhere with new NPCs that weren't there before, some have small stories relating to a pokemon or a secret event-travel the multiverse on top of a beast and find legendaries, shinies or Ultra beasts depending on how well you play and again fight for the best score. There's also new Ultra Beasts and their lore was revamped a lot.-face an entire new saga in the postgame, who was also expanded a lot too by the way-fight the new Battle tree mode that lets you go all out with no restrictionsAnd that's the top of my head only.Everything that I praised in Sun and Moon is either back or better, plus more, making this feel like a worthy replay instead of how previous games like Crystal or Yellow would feel as the same with no changes. I'd say the changes here by far surpassed previous examples the series itself gave, even though those games are some I really enjoy too.I go as far as to say the Alola part of this long series is not just composed of amazing games, they also feel like a love letter to the fans, from the real challenge it brings as the hardest games, to improving and callibrating the content from its predecessors, to the whole mentioned above post-game plotline, that brings a decent challenge mixed with a nostalgia trip that brings so many characters back from all gens. You can even restart the game multiple times and it will feel as if its the first since there's so many options to pokemon in your team, helps that without hms I can do monotype runs and other gimmicks by myself too, which would before be gimped by restrictions that aren't put on you anymore.",Bald_Strikes

At that point in time I underwent a personal revolution, and because of my education, my worldview, critical thinking abilities, and creative and interpersonal skills all changed for the better. This game will forever be tied into that vital and enlightening time, and represents to me a part of the universe that strives to be all that it can be.-Over the past few years, I've struggled with alcoholism and substance abuse. My Dad's genetic code has locked within it a predisposition to addiction-- evidenced by the death of my Uncles. DS was and still is an escape away from the chaos of my life and the second law of Thermodynamics. I'd say that I've played the game for at least 500-600 hours, if not more. That fact in itself speaks volumes about the game's production values, replay values and overall design ingenuity.- There's a few disgruntled individuals who still think that video games are not art. The critical and logical fallaciousness contained within said belief is pretty unfortunate. I'm a musician, and I write songs-- someday, I hope my music will reach others and colour their worlds as it colours mine. Dark Souls is absolutely beautiful, and represents the palate of emotions we feel and the dilemmas we face every day of our lives. Fear, wonder, determination, surprise, discouragement, joy, light vs. dark, moral ambiguity, survival of the fittest, superstition, betrayal, camaraderie etc. DS has it all.-Philosophy is one of the most important areas of study in existence (trumped maybe only by science and the scientific method). Nietzsche famously said that if you stare long enough into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. In Dark Souls, there's almost a feeling like the game world itself is communicating with you, trying to tell you something, and this only grows stronger as your knowledge and playtime increases. There's a deep philosophical message implanted in the game, and players filter it differently through their respective lenses. At its core though, I think Dark Souls wants you to become an Existentialist Hero-- an individual who confronts the absurdity of existence and the certainty of death... and emerges victorious.",KingYellow

I'm guessing most of the ""reviews"" on here are coming from people that haven't even played the game.  I've played every COD game and each of the Battlefield games released for the 360.   I couldn't get both games this year so had to pick just one.  The beta for BF3 convinced me to go with MW3 (not to mention most of my friends were getting this game).I've got about a dozen hours into the MP and feel that it's very comparable to MW2, but with some interesting (but good) changes and better graphics.  I realize a lot of people are complaining that it's similar to previous installments.  My response is, ""yeah, and??"".  They're supposed to be similar.  You can't make sweeping changes to the game and expect to keep the core audience.  This particular formula has made COD the king of the hill of first person shooters.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it!The campaign to this point (about 5 hours in) isn't great but is definitely a step up from MW2.  I'm playing through on veteran and am thoroughly enjoying myself with it.  As with all COD campaigns, the gameplay and shooting is phenomenal.  I find myself not overly interested in the storyline, but if I want a story, I'll read a book.  I play games for gameplay and fun, and this campaign delivers on both accounts.My favorite part of the game is definitely spec-ops.  I've got about 15 hours into survival mode and am overly impressed.  This (imo) is what makes this worth the purchase.  As I mentioned earlier, I've been playing COD forever and don't really care too much about the MP any longer. This mode, however, will keep me wanting more.  Single player or coop (coop is defintely more fun).  I haven't even had time for the spec-ops missions yet, and I really enjoyed them in MW2.Overall, this game is about a 9.25 for me.  It's not an all time great, but is worth the price of admission.  I can't speak of BF3, which a lot of people seem to be whining about on here, but I can't imagine it offers more as a whole.  I really think it's a shame that there are so many degenerates posting reviews on a game.  A zero, really?  A 2, really?  Even if you hate COD, rating it as a 6 or 7 will get your point across.  But marking it a 5 or under is just plain hating and has no business here.  A lot of us read the user reviews on sites like Metacritic to guage whether or not we should get a certain game, and the dumba$$es marking the score down are doing all of us a disservice.

I have not had any severe technical problems. However, the overall product is awful and frustrating enough I had to vent by writing this review. The graphics and performance is terrible. Rockstar has claimed this is a ""next generation"" game and current generation hardware is only capable of playing the game on ""medium"" settings. If that is true, the game should at least look and perform like a current generation game on current generation hardware, but that isn't the case at all. It uses DirectX 9. There is no anti-aliasing. Shadows flicker and look horrible. Textures and character models lack detail. Frame rates are sub-25 on recommend settings. Options to customize graphic detail is limited. Aside from graphical issues, this game requires you to join two online networks (Games for Windows, Rockstar Social Club) for full functionality. There is no option to turn off ""mouse-look"" when driving a car, which makes driving extremely difficult. You must manually turn the camera using the mouse at the same time you are steering the car. Loading times are rather slow compared to other games. Purchased through Steam, the game does not include a manual and there is no easy reference for all the instructions, moves, and tips that only come up only one time in-game. To sum it up, it looks, feels and plays like a bad port of an older console game. I'd give the game itself at least a 7, but this as an overall product deserves no more than a 3.",KurtS

The obvious could be viewed by anyone with a collection of screen-shots. That is, the game looked completely amazing, completely beautiful from beginning to end. To the point where this game could get off completely on it's presentation alone. The game is set in a fantasy world, complete with underground cities giant castles, war torn battlefields, and frozen wastelands.But the true majesty of this setting is enhanced by the fact that you don't play as an epic hero. You play as a couple kids who are way way over their head. This makes everything feel much more threatening and magical then it would otherwise.The story is excellent, and told almost entirely through game play, with only a handful of cut scenes throughout the entire game. There is no dialogue because it is unnecessary. The story is simple, and in this case that is a good thing. It is trying to convey emotions and ideas, instead of complex political messages. So it only uses what is necessary to do that.What keeps this game from getting a 10 is 1 simple things. The first being that the PC controls without a controller are very poor. One brother controls with WASD and space bar. Which works perfectly. the problem is that the other brother controls with the arrow keys and the left CTRL. This gets to a point of actually being physically painful. Just hover your right hand over those keys and see.I imagine I could give it a perfect score if I played it with a controller, but unfortunately that isn't the case.I suppose the length of only 2-3 hours was another deciding factor in it. But really it wasn't that big of a deal, just that for most games I wouldn't think that I had spent enough time playing it to judge it, and with this I am already done.But the 2-3 hours spent in this game are pure and necessary. There is nothing that wastes your time and nothing that doesn't do what it is supposed to.It's the difference between grinding for 100 hours in world of warcraft and spending a few hours experiencing something truly special.If movie tickets are worth 17 dollars this is definitely worth 15. and you will leave this feeling something.",Trollton47

115407,Battlefield 3,PC,3,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        After being disgusted with Bad Company 2. I was very dissapointed with Battlefield 3 and the way the Battlefield franchise is going. Just so you fanboys can flag this and leave here's a summary:+Good Graphics and Sounds+Co-op-Bad SP storyline-dull gameplay-Rent a Server-MP not staying true to the series-Overall FanbaseLet me say that the graphics are at it's best, though I had a problem running it on high, I was still immensly satisfied with the looks of the game. But good graphics don't make or break a game. The single player campaign is a bland storyline where you play as a marine in custody in New York as your main character. The story is flashbacks of his recent career as a marine with every generic thing we've seen in a Modern Military FPS: Nukes and Russians. The story of blackburn is really taken from Call of Duty: Black Ops and every major moment in the game is inspired from a Call of Duty Game.The Co-op was very enjoyable with a friend, though very short. Each mission requires much teamwork and strategy. You play through a series of 6 missions each requiring you do different things from different milliaries.The multiplayer was very dissapointing, many glitches and hackers can be found. Teamkillers and trollers are often always present. And when they aren't, you can often be expected  to be spawn-killed and quickscoped. The health system is terrible. If you stand 100m away, you can spray a full clip into your enemy and he will survive. If you stand 50m from your enemy, we will die with 2 bullets to the legs. Very unrealistic and just flat out bad hit detection. Though weapon balancing is okay, many players will hide in front of walls so their legs can be hidden in the walls, very easy to solve but DICE doesn't have any attention to solve it.In conclusion, if you're a long time fan of the Battlefield Franchise, you will be very dissapointed with this game. DICE has made the game to attract casual audiences to attempt to make a ""Call of Duty Killer"" which is very dissapointing considering Battlefield was very good in it's own way before BC2.",SammyBoyEmo

Frankly, release night was an atrocity, that much is true. However, after logging over 20 hours in the first two days (I honestly couldn't stop playing) I must say that this iteration of World of Warcraft is by far the most polished and engaging expansion. The story driven questing keeps me interested in the lore of Draenor, as well as the leveling process, and I've got to say this is by far one of the least ""grindy"" leveling experiences I've had. The main characters of antagonists of Draenor, the Warlords, are easy to relate to, they have much more emotion to them than almost any other character I've interacted with in previous installments of the game.Although there were a few bugs that I've seen people mentioning (such as flight paths, garrisons, and some quests) I really didn't have much trouble. There were only two times that I actually had to force quit the game and re-log to continue playing.The Garrisons feature is also a very fun and interactive way to progress with the story as well as professions. Having a sense of ""owning"" something more than just what's in your characters inventory is a very liberating feeling. It sets you apart from other people on a higher level while at the same time giving you even more interaction with the world around you.",iarethom

So every game ive played so far has been in terrible lag as it paired me up apparently with people in africa or something. Second problem is that low This game has some SERIOUS flaws in it that apparently the game reviewers totally missed. First, the online mode does not have a lobby (or if it does, im totally unaware of it) so you have no idea who (or what connection) your opponent has. So every game ive played so far has been in terrible lag as it paired me up apparently with people in africa or something. Second problem is that low block scoring has been made entirely too simple. If you choose the suns you can just give the ball to shaq down low and he will score 100% of the time even if hes standing in a 4 man zone. This makes for very uneven play as it turns into just watching shaq score every time for 25 minutes of your life. 3rd problem is that the only way to stop the exploit is to just foul every time someone gets the ball in the paint. OK, so what? its impossible to shoot freethrows with the new system they implemented especially in all the lag you will inevitably have. Not only does the lag make freethrows near impossible, but it makes them totally random, so sometimes you will get a ""Bad release (too early)"" and other times you will get ""Bad release (too late)"" message while holding back [R] for the exact same amount of time...VERY FRUSTRATING. In one online game I played, my opponent just fouled me every time as soon as I inbound the ball because he was losing. I couldnt hit any freethrows and soon I was losing so I started fouling him back. Basically the game was just us fouling each other as soon as we could for 2 quarters. (the game lasted almost an hour) Just terrible. As if these problems werent enough, the game will randomly FREEZE my ps3 when searching for an online opponent. I don't mean that it will take a long time... I mean it will ACTUALLY FREEZE the ps3 and force you to restart. This is happening to a lot of people as ive heard and i'm not an outlier. Anyway, I just wish each of these gaming review companies would spend a little more time with the game before telling people to buy them because now I am out of 60 bucks with a piece of junk game.

TheI had high expectations out of this game. I was a huge fan of the original Crash Bandicoot and Jak  Daxter games so I bought the game based off the developer. I am very disappointed with my purchase. I enjoyed the characters and graphics but this was not enough for me. The game calls itself an adventure game, yet it is more of a shooter, despite being called more of an adventure game. The puzzles are completely hit or miss, some are very easy, others are just down right ridiculous. The game got very tedious when there got to be WAY to many enemies.After playing this game for about 6 hours, I completely stopped playing because I wasn't having fun. Another thing that pissed me off was the fact that they turned the game into a horror game very late in the game. They should have told you they'd do this on the back of the cover or something, this way I'd have an idea on what I'm buying. So if you're like me, and simply not into horror games don't buy this game. I thought the horror aspect wouldn't last to long but it lasts about an hour to an hour and a half. So much for an adventure game, huh? How about sticking to your routes Naughty Dog? Go back to Jak  Daxter, because I hate this game much more than the Lost Frontier. Like I said decent story and characters, with fantastic graphics, but definitely not a good adventure game. The people who gave this positive reviews probably enjoy shooter and horror aspects, I for one don't. Sorry Uncharted, heard you were a great series but you obviously aren't for me.",TheAgentBrandon

You will visit some masterfully crafted environments, and I had several moments where I had to stop and just, gaze. The graphics are on par with the best the system can throw at you.Audio: The voices are well done, though the developer is Polish the game avoids the ""poor voice over"" syndrome so commonly found in ports. The voices are strong enough that they feel natural and at no point interfere with immersion.Story: There are some meaningful themes that run across the series, and often there is no right, only the lesser of two evils. Though I do not know how much my choices truly changed the outcome, the story is still one of the best of all the games I have ever played. This game is a saga of the White Wolf, and it made me think.Between the story, and the audiovisual component, this game puts CDProject Red on par with Bioware as master story craftsmen. Gameplay: Once you get used to the controls, the fighting is seamless enough, though this is where the .3 was subtracted from the game as artifacts of the eventual port to 360 are present in the PC version. The mouse feels ""off"" as best I can describe it, too fast when selecting but too slow a camera if you adjust for the selection. The interface lacks a few basic things, like quickload. The game doesn't do as good a job as I'd have liked of explaining some of the more complex components, it was not until the third act that I figured out how to use mutagens. The mouse feels underused, and there is a sense that the game is designed with a gamepad in mind but not to such an extent as other similar ports. The developers seem to have at least tried to stay true to the PC roots.There is a reason that my cons contribute but 3% of the score. When the game is taken as a whole, the massive amount done right far outweighs the little annoyances. If you like deep, meaningful RPGs, this game is a godsend.I'm now going to go design my own dice poker board.",ElGuybrush

It is a horrid game to try and get into, and a lot of players will turn it off within 30 minutes because not since the likes of X-Com (the old one) has a game been this reliant on literally hundreds of micro options. So it's crucial you get the UI and navigation right - EU4 does and doesn't in equal measure. The menus are strategy gamer porn - but you need a magnifying glass to see them. So it makes the game a pleasure and a chore in equal measure.A key part of the game is a stat called Stability, and it is this that is very much in the hands of the RNG gods, as random events pop up at... well, random, to undo your best laid plans. Rather than add to the game an element of dynamism, they serve to by and large annoy.You can pore hundreds of hours into this, then look back with satisfaction but also an element of ""what the hell did I just do all that for?"" It's fun and tedious, compelling yet labour intensive.In summary, if you love Civilisation and want an extra challenge (albeit an overstated one; when you get the hang of this, it's positively easy), then EU4 is for you. If you haven't played Civ, consider picking up Civ4 first and getting your feet wet before delving into this, as it's a game where even the tutorial takes pleasure in complicating you.",Tubey

If you are new to XCOM series you will like it more than the veterans, because this game is a much dumbed cousin of its elders. The game is quite addicting thanks to some RPG/RTS elements. The deeper you go the more new stuff you discover and new weapons. Other times the missions are nearly impossible to accomplish because you for example get thrown with little to no cover into a swarm of bazooka wielding giants. The natural part of the frustration is losing your men (and women heh)  other times you will have to sacrifice newbies to get a clear shot for the captain. The game can be really hard even at normal difficulty setting so much so that if you`re new to this I highly recommend not selecting a higher setting than normal. The maps are fairly varied, not too much but just enough to keep going forward. There are also a few mission types, honestly here I was dissapointed. Overall the campaign is good, it proceeds just when it is about to get stale. Some strategy and thinking is required. I played 33hours to get through the whole thing, which is a huge number for a game nowadays. Moreso, the game is built the way that makes you want to beat it at least twice, because the first time you did not know the whole set of rules. Gaphics and music is okay.

The action is exciting, tight, and can be quite challenging when using all of the idols. The music is some of the best that I've heard from any game, bar none. The choice of implementing the stylistic narrator is arguably one of the most distinct features of the game, and for good reason, it injects real flavor into the game.TL;DR: I enjoyed every minute of Bastion.

Lets face it, for a game in which the sole mechanic is 3rd person shooting, and who's gameplay relies heavily on using bullet time to aim precisely, Rockstar have severely dropped the ball in the controls department. When it comes to the PS3, the controls are just too unresponsive and lack the fluidity needed in a game like this. It feels almost as if it was a port of the GTA control scheme, which is fine for GTA, but not here. In a Max Payne game you need to be able to aim and shoot, and on the PS3 you cant.Moreover the control scheme itself is entirely counter intuitive. Not only can you not change the buttons on the controller to suit your play style, you are forced into choosing one of only 4 different control set-ups which don't differ enough to cover all the bases and play styles out there. If you don't believe me try making reload the square button and triangle the button for take cover. It cant be done!My other major gripe is the story and art design. Don't get me wrong, the game looks beautiful, and the story line has a great sense of atmosphere and dialogue, setting and characters. The problem is though, that as good as all of this is, it just doesn't seem like a Max Payne game, and ill tell you why. The Max Payne series was always about more than guns, bullet time, crooks and vulnerable women. It was about it's titular character. Max was a cop, a good cop who lost his family in a tragic set of circumstances. Nonetheless he always stayed true to his policeman roots. His role was as protector and detector. He sought out the reasons and causes for what was happening around him and he didn't take no for an answer. It wasn't money that spurned him, but justice and love for what he had lost.And then there is the film noir or neo noir genre that gave the series it's look and feel. The story, design, artwork, setting and characters all were born out of and coincidentally added something to that particular genre.All of these things however, seem somehow lost on both the creative minds at Rockstar and the game itself. Sao Paulo doesn't lend itself well to the film noir genre with all of its sun and colour, and the criminally minded characters that seem to appear in every Rockstar game don't cut the mustard when compared to the first two games. Most importantly Max goes from a skinny, hard boiled, mild mannered, polite, but tortured policeman with a thing for saving women and cracking down on drugs, to a drug addicted, fat, bald, potty mouth Bruce Willis look-a-like with a penchant for getting women killed. I'm sorry, but do you really expect me to believe that Max got addicted to painkillers despite the fact that his greatest love in life was killed as a result of drug related violence?......I don't think so buddy, not by a long shot.I have to admit, Max Payne 3 IS a good game, it's just not the game i was expecting from the Max Payne franchise, nor the one i think is deserving of the Max Payne 3 logo. As a result it is definitely the weakest of the three games and the farthest from the mark.Final score is 6/10 - Good, but not great.",spacedog

Such a shame cos like others I was really looking forward to this title. Maybe with future patches it will be addressed as I'm sure I'm not alone here. I'm giving it a 5 out of 10 because as a game it's amazing, but with it's current performance I feel cheated and may as well have stuck with my Xbox edition. ----------------------------------------------------> UPDATE 13/05/2012 ... Since the recent patches I went back to AW and admit it runs much, much better now. I still haven't completed it but wanted to change my score to justify its current state. It's a good game full of drama. Not really a 'horror' game, but a heart stopper all the same. Score upped from a 5 to an 8.",The_Ommadawn

The quest designs are thoughtful, and express real and believable human needs without seeming as contrived with the express purpose of giving the player something to do.  The options before Geralt, and for the most part the outcomes, make sense.I love the game, but here’s my wishlist….The world is large, but more variation in landscape could augment that sense of being in a vast world.	The leveling system and tech tree are adequate, but could use some tweaks.  More depth of character customization/specialization would augment the game. I would also prefer to see a combat system more akin to LOTR Shadow, Batman, etc. that is conducive to combos.Clearly the above mentioned suggestions didn't ruin the game for me, as I still rate it at 9.5.Truly a PS 4 essential for lovers of open world RPGs.",Dante-X

You'll be finding various keys throughout the game and you'll need to revisit certain areas in order to proceed further.However, it is not a total return to its roots. There are a lot of new concepts here, but that's not a bad thing.Resident Evil is known for evolving with time. RE4 did the same and it was well received.The new concepts include elements like the constant threat of the Baker family; you'll have to sneak through the house in order to avoid the family members. That is something that hasn't been experienced in any other older games, but it is easy to assume that games like Outlast and Alien have hugely influenced this new direction for the series. It is not a bad thing at all, it works very well.However, there are certain things that I didn't like:- Boss fights aren't well designed, and it's very easy to get through them. A game like Evil Within totally captured what a boss fight in a survival horror game should be like, but unfortunately, Resident Evil 7 lacks in that department.- The game really isn't that difficult. There is item management and a constant lack of ammunition, but the game itself isn't very challenging. Perhaps the game desperately needed a hard difficulty that could be selectable from the very beginning.- Puzzles are very simplistic, and they're rather bland. They don't require much thought at all. They're almost non-existent.- I feel like the game is missing a basic enemy character in the beginning stages. You are chased by Jack Baker in the beginning, and after a while you'll come across the Molded, but it seems like there's a missing enemy between these important encounters. A normal, quintessential zombie-type enemy would have added to the experience.Ultimately, the game isn't scary or terrifying, it is rather exciting and tense. Paranormal elements are not to be found here, and in that sense, the game is much more in line with something like Alien: Isolation than it is with a game like P.T.",liontamer

The graphics are a step up from D2, but are reminiscent of 2004-2006, and do not evoke any nostalgia from the earlier titles in the series - hell, there is no light radius!  That was a great feature in the original games.  The story is quite bland, and even the characters that follow you throughout the game do not grow on you; however, I do enjoy the retorts of the companions and their interactions with the player.  Those characters are much more fleshed out that even... wow, I actually forgot the name of the girl who is the centerpoint of the story!  Aha! Leah, wow.  I was going to just sit and think for a bit and keep typing her name, but the fact that I am an avid roleplayer (both paper and pencil and classic RPGs) and I could not remember a leading NPCs name says something to the quality of the storyline.The constant patching and downtime is expected in the early weeks of a new game, but this was not meant to be an MMO, but rather, staying true to its predecessors, a single player game with LAN or battle.net connectivity.  So if I do not play online I cannot use the Auction House?  I don't care.  I would gladly make a character on battle.net and play online with support and have my offline skirmisher for when I had 30 mins or so to kill.  D2 even had the open battle.net option where I could bring my offline character online and search for other players.  On gameplay, I can understand removing the town portal and auto-identifying items to make the game more fast paced, and the new skill system has its merits, but I feel that one thing is to streamline the playthrough, and another thing entirely is to simplify it down to the point that it loses all appeal other than left click kill, left click loot, left click move.  Inventory management, skill or talent choices, visual character customization!!!!, to name a few examples are part of action-RPGs.  The devil is in the details, and I would say that this proverb is even more true in a game titled Diablo.  There is something severely missing in Diablo 3, I have come to the realization that I have been able to play for this long because I have been grouping with the same two friends to progress together, but honestly I have rarely played solo much - the first act I did alone and enjoyed it greatly I will admit.  I believe that this act is the most faithful to the franchise - if they added darker lighting effects and a fog of war or light radius if would truly be creepy and Diablo-esque.  However, the random idiot yellow robed cultists and the purple flying faerie that COMPLETELY deter my immersion into the game, please make them black robed even if it's generic and have the purple faerie witch be less flamboyant - and without WINGS!!! arg!!!To summarize, this game seems to have lost its direction and is not worthy to be named a continuation of the Diablo legacy.  I hope that Blizzard sees this and reviews its decisions with this game for future endeavors.  I have no hopes for any significant changes in a game that is free-to-play, sadly -- Blizzard already got my $60 and well I guess that price for a few weeks of gaming isn't so bad -- there is no monthly subscription (thank God) which is the biggest incentive in online games to make changes.  Play the demo (they should have a 3-day pass offer still) before you decide to invest in this game.  Hopefully you will get to Act 2 and see how far it diverges from the spirit of the series.",Vistavian

273019,Assassin's Creed Origins,PlayStation4,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I had kind of given up on the AC series and only picked this one up because I saw some amazing environments shown off, and I wanted to spend some time in ancient Egypt. And I have to say this game was a very nice surprise.It is very clear that they were aware of the reputation AC was getting (and really all annual series get) and they really tried and succeeded to improve their formula. The open world feels much more alive this time, the sidequests are much more substantial, and there is a lot of variation in the gameplay.The WorldThe world looks absolutely amazing. I've not seen a single area that didn't look like someone spent time to make it look interesting. Of course there are the famous areas to visit, like the pyramids, but every area of the game is packed with interesting things to discover.The Side ContentThe sidequests are more interesting as well, they've clearly tried to give them some more depth and they're a lot less repetitive. Some even had a connection to or gave more depth to the main story.I also love the trial of the Gods, maybe because I had not heard anything about it, so when I came across the little icon and curiously went to look in on it, and suddenly had to face off a giant god, it felt very epic.The Main StoryThe only major complaint I have with this game is the main story and the way it is told.The main story feels incredibly boring, especially for what it is meant to be, the origins story of the Brotherhood. And I feel the game releases this as near the end it suddenly rushes through some events that should feel epic, but don't because they barely spend any time on them.After spending who knows how many hours on the first targets - all of which feel underwhelming to say the least - we barely get any time during: the attempt on Cleopatra's life, the siege of Alexandria, the betrayal of the Cleopatra, the last two targets, a chariot chase, a sea battle, the creation of the Brotherhood, and the murder of Caesar.All those events sound like they'd be very interesting to play through, except they are so crammed together with so little time it just felt frustrating and even boring in the end.One of the main things wrong with the main story - besides the pacing issues I just mentioned - are how they tried to implement Aya.The Aya segments feel like they at one point were planning a story DLC with her as the lead but scrapped it, and kept the finished parts to stuff them in the main story of AC:O. The Aya parts of the story feel either completely disconnected from the main story, or unnecessary. I really liked Aya, but I could not enjoy playing her because of the clunky way she was implemented.The worst offender is having to play her epilogue. We have to fight against someone we already defeated, and then quickly have to assassinate Caesar. I can't help but feel like that should have been a separate DLC, or even in a separate game with Aya as the lead. I don't understand how they thought people would enjoy spending 100 hours building up Bayek to then spend the final moments of the game with another character.Bad as those portions were, the Layla portions were even more crammed in with no real sense to them. It's too bad because the Isu tombs were very interesting so I had hopes they'd implement the sci-fi element better this time.The Main CharactersI did genuinely like both Bayek and Aya, and I feel they wanted to go for a 'mother and father of the Brotherhood' feeling with them, but they didn't do them justice in the story. At times their characterisation felt inconsistent, and in the end we only get seconds of seeing them in their new roles.I don't understand how the story goes from Aya being the one who is more ambitious to then having Bayek basically assemble the brotherhood between some NPCs (most of which needed a bit more time to be memorable).The relationship between Bayek and Aya worked so well that it also felt really jarring to suddenly have Bayek announce he can't be with Aya because her face reminds him of a dead loved one (not even their son, oddly enough), but then on the beach he suddenly wants to be with her again but now she doesn't want to be with him. It's just a very odd note to end on, 'oh we have just formed a very strong brotherhood but we're also going our separate ways.' I would much rather have seen them stay together and be a power couple leading the Brotherhood.FinallyThere are some other minor things that bothered me. Most of the outfits are boring and it feels like they did that to tempt you to buy them from the e-store. The combat is clunky and somewhat unresponsive. Some of the abilities should have been given to you from the start.For most games these issues and the issues with the main story would be a bigger misstep, but this game made up for it in all other areas and I'll probably spend another 100 hours in it before getting bored.",angelknives

While the game borrows aspects from both, it also stands apart with its own innovative feature, the Nemesis system.

ItIn a way, “Shadow of Mordor” is a quality title nearly as good as “Batman: Arkham Asylum” and “Assassin’s Creed II”. While the game borrows aspects from both, it also stands apart with its own innovative feature, the Nemesis system. Based on the Middle Earth film adoptions by Peter Jackson, “Shadow of Mordor” acts as a bridge between “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy. It also introduces a new protagonist, a ranger named Talion. During the prologue, Talion and his family are ritualistically killed by The Black Hand of Sauron. However, Talion is merged with the wraith of an Elf Lord named Celebrimbor and gains wraith-like abilities. Shortly after, they embark on a quest to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. If it sounds a little like a Middle Earth version of “The Crow”, it really isn’t. This is an open-world action game very similar to Ubi Soft’s “Assassin’s Creed” and “Far Cry 3” in terms of structure. It also features the intuitive combat system introduced in “Batman: Arkham Asylum”. What it brings to the table is the Nemesis system which affects the Orc armies in several different ways. For instance, if you kill a Captain, power shifts as the other Orcs rise in rank and fight for promotions. If a Captain survives your attacks, they’ll increase in power and change in appearance (to reflect their wounds). As you progress, you’ll eventually gain the ability to pit Orcs against each other. It’s a brilliant innovative feature that brings a sense of unpredictability to the battlefield.  The core gameplay of SOM is a hack n’ slash affair with plenty of side-missions and objects scattered throughout the map. The progression system is similar to the one featured in “Far Cry 3”. There is a “tree branch” chart that represents the different groups of abilities you can earn and upgrade. And just like in the 2013 reboot of “Tomb Raider”, you can discover hidden objects that reveal information about the past. Rated ‘M’ for bloody violence, this game is a major gorefest. You’ll decapitate countless of Orcs as you progress through the game. In fact, one of the most impressive features of SOM is the lack of lag during encounters with numerous enemies on-screen. The framerate never falters during these intense moments. Overall, “Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor” is a near masterpiece of the hack n’ slash genre. The Nemesis system, a solid story, smooth combat mechanics and impressive production values really make it shine. It’s an example of how to make a really good action game based on an existing property. I’d rank it with a 9 out of 10.       ",Alex_Pilgrim

Unfortunately not on Ps3 though. While some may argue whether or not you can rate a game 0 when the first 50 hours were awesome, or if you should take into account THAT you were able to play it for 50 hours whereas other games don't even last as long, it simply and ultimately comes down to the fact that this is a faulty product and does not deliver what the company promised. As Ps3 users we are more or less used to get the bad ports and with Skyrim it is no different. The graphics and general performance is the worst out of the 3 platforms, but that's not really an issue. Skyrim is still a good looking game, even gorgeos at times. And while it has some annoying yet bearable drops in framerate every now and then, the biggest game breaker is the massive 'lag' or stuttering that people are most likely to experience at some point. Imagine it to run with 0-5 frames per second. Since the latest update, a lot of other issues have arisen too. First and foremost the freezes which lock up your Ps3 and will eventually corrupt your hard drive. Add in occasionally broken main quests which prevent you from completing the game, a lot (read: a LOT) of other bugs and Bethesda's track record of how they dealt with bugs in previous games for Ps3, shake the whole thing and decide on your own if you really want to try the nicely looking yet somehow fishy smelling result. My advice: Don't. Just don't. You might get sick. Now, if you think we're just trolls, there's an easy way to find out. Just take a look to the right and read the official review from PSOM UK, or hit up youtube and type in ""Skyrim Ps3 lag"", check IGN who are currently investigating, go to the official Bethesda forums, heck, inform yourself any way you like, but don't believe those who gave the game a perfect 10 to know about ANYTHING. We are just here to warn you. *** Rated 0 because the game is fundamentally broken on Ps3. ***PS: You're probably confused because people are telling different save file sizes at which the lag begins. That's because it's not directly related to the size nor to the hours spent. It's related to how much you've done in the game. The engine keeps track of everything you do and since everyone plays at their own pace, it greatly varies for everyone when the stuttering will finally occur.

The game tells you that you will be judged. If you play with your girlfriend or wife I guarantee you it won’t just be the game judging you.First the good bits. This is surprisingly well written. Yes Katherine with a K is a bit of a trope as a harridan making her man grow up. Yet she isn’t wrong and plenty of women in their early thirties struggle with the same issues with their partners. (Particularly partners that play video games and watch anime such as the audience for this game.) There is also a lot more depth to the story and characters than may first appear during the playthrough,The main gameplay is two-fold. One is sitting around a bar talking to patrons and friends and answering text messages. The game has multiple endings based on your actions but often I felt I didn’t really have the ability to actually steer the story. I get the impression despite my diligence in talking to everyone I missed significant bits. It has a Mass effect on the ship feel but without as much apparent dialogue choice.The other main gameplay element is a climbing blocks puzzle reminiscent of Qbert. I, at times, hated it. It has a nasty difficulty spike halfway through and there is no way around it if you want to see the story (Playing on easy does not seem to make the puzzles themselves easier. It just gives you more money and lives) Speaking of lives the puzzle segments gives Dark Souls a run for its money. I can’t remember seeing the you died screen this often in a game. To the game's credit however, the checkpoints are somewhat generous.This may be a game one has to play more than once to fully appreciate as I sense I had more freedom of choice than I realized. The block puzzles are tough and frustrating but the narrative is such that instead of giving up I struggled through and actually got better.If you like good more adult themed Anime and don’t mind earning your pudding Catherine is an excellent game.",juliankennedy23

When approaching computer games, you really need to ask yourself three or four questions. 1) Is it worth sixty dollars? 2) Will it function optimally on my configuration? 3) Am I going to enjoy it? These are typically what a customer will process. Now I give a lot of credit to EA, Big Huge Games and 38 studios. They delivered a rather solid demo three weeks in advance. The demo was short but gave you a excellent idea of the games core. Demo's are incredibly risky, for obvious reasons. Why many companies shy away from them. Down to the elements of Reckoning, which at it's very heart are the game mechanics. They're solid, you're locked into a 3rd person view point. The camera is only controlled by swivels of your mouse. It will automatically zoom out during multiple enemy flanks. Interface is simple and easy to understand. You wont be getting any no-ui like Fable 3. Combat is very simplistic, for me personally overly-so. Divinity II has similar combat, that title was very well done also. My only real issue with combat is ranged attacks lock-on to your target. You'll find yourself either blocking a lot or barrel rolling to victory. Graphics are stylized, they aren't exactly ground breaking. Like I explained earlier, it's all about what you want out of a video game. Performance rather than graphics are a major factor for me. The game runs smoothly on a EVGA Geforce GTS 450 Fermi, it also runs smoothly on a ATI 4670HD both 1gig memory. You'll get anywhere between 40-60 FPS on those cards. I noticed some bugs, first off subtitles are getting stuck, music becomes choppy during developer/publisher intro. NPC's will just stop during combat. It definitely has issues.

What could've been one of my most memorable gaming experiences turned out to be one of the most disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I still thought Shadow of the Colossus was a good game,This is a game I did not experience for the first time until the remastered version was released, and I will admit I was very excited to try it out, as I had heard nothing but good things about the game. What could've been one of my most memorable gaming experiences turned out to be one of the most disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I still thought Shadow of the Colossus was a good game, but I did not understand where the game's status as a ""masterpiece"" came from.As far as the positives with this game go, the game looks absolutely stunning, and is one of the most visually appealing games ever released. Also, the attention to detail within the world's landscapes is amazing, and it really makes the whole world feel alive. Finally, I really liked how the game took a non-traditional method to storytelling, and rather than relying on constant dialogue and cut scenes, the game tells its story through the actions of the player.Even though there are a lot of positives about this game, there are quite a few negatives that I simply cannot ever look past. First of all, the gameplay and controls both feel very clunky and unresponsive. This may have felt just fine in 2005, but in 2018, when we have games with advanced physics engines and tighter controls, this game's controls stick out like a sore thumb. Also, I found very few of the colossi to be genuinely fun and entertaining to take down, those being Avion, Phalanx, and Dirge, while the rest either felt decent at best or insanely frustrating at worst (Celosia). But quite possibly the worst of all, this game has very little replay value. What I mean by that is, once you've beaten the game once, there is no reason to back and play the game a second time, as it will be the exact same thing. So unless you really enjoyed playing through the game, I can't recommend you play through the game more than once, and I don't ever see myself playing through this game again.In conclusion, Shadow of the Colossus is certainly a good game and one I recommend everyone tries out once throughout their life. But even so, the game is incredibly flawed and far from a masterpiece, at least in my opinion.",Rstiles7

They took out the weapon damage modifier where it now feels like I'm playing halo. Now to the 3rd of the series. For starters i will come out and say its the most well rounded game of the series.  The single player was a good way to end the series and the multiplayer was still not as good as the first, but an improvement from the 2nd. The series conclusion left me hanging off the edge of my seat while playing the final level and throughout the entire story. There are some amazing cut scenes which is a little new to the other games for there weren't too many that brought emotion out of me like this game The different types of enemies keep you interested in the game as well as the many different types of weapons. Unlike Call of Duty where your just killing soldiers in Resistance you have different types of soldiers where you have to change your strategy in order to have a better chance of killing the chimera. The graphics of the game are as good as they have been although there wasn't any wow moments like the moment of San Francisco in R2. Now to the multiplayer, although i was upset its ranged away from the multiplayer in the first resistance, i will settle on this multiplayer. For starters it takes less time to kill enemies which i think is a much better approach, Insomniac decided to keep the humans vs. the chimera like in R2 which i do not mind but i also do wish that there was a custom game option where you could do humans vs humans and change the damage like in Resistance Fall of Man.  But in conclusion, the game is a good game to end the fabulous series which was one of the most entertaining ps3 exclusives along with uncharted, infamous, and god of war. I suggest this game to anyone who has played the previous games of this great series.",yogi721

That's mainly because good name of company, 2 of those so called professional critics gave mixed review. This is really worrying effect how critics are not having critical reviews only marketing speeches.So lets get to the actual review played this game through with one character. Second play though with harder difficulty found game to be boring. As for even wanting to level any character again to level 60 whats the point in that skills come as progress levels. So there is no reason for that. This is mainly because really none of customization you can do talent or attribute wise its just all about gear you wear.Also because they actually released ""online or no play game"" i keep getting constantly dc:t from game which actually shows how greedy this Blizzard company actually is. Game is just basically unplayable for those that get disconnected about every 5 mins to 30 minutes. I have actually done more tweaking to my security firewalls etc for this game than to any other games and it still has serious issues. Almost always when you actually try to get answers from technical support problems are on your side not their precious servers or product. They start ""you could try..."" its not consumers job to make game work. There should be some pride for game developers to make working game.So good advice for all that are playing games around world never ever pre-order game, never buy those cheesy priced collectors editions or limited (luckily i did buy only standard edition) and most off all always wait about 6 to 12 months after release to get actually patched up game. Mainly never read what these so marketing critics write about game they tend to go overboard praising the series or company that made game.In old good days of gaming we did not have DRM only cd-keys to check your games legality.

I've played it twice and was surprised how much I picked up on that I didn't notice the first time. It's an incredible game. However there are a few crtiticisms I have for it, nothing that really hinders the experience but things that could have made it even better. The weapon upgrades are shallow compared to bio 1 and 2, most of them are either minor damage or clip size upgrades, would have liked to see more variation in that department. Also I don't like how in bioshock games, dying doesn't really have any penalty beyond respawning out of the battle area. They did add a few penalties such as enemies getting some of their health back, but overall I would have preferred they scrapped this idea for the sake of a more balanced health system. Lastly and most importantly, I really would have liked to see them do more with the boys of silence, they only show up in one section toward the end and their role seemed pretty underdeveloped.

It's predecessor was a brilliant, fun strategy game. There were lots of unique civs to pick, historic campaigns to play, and a simple, easy, but flexible map editor. AOE 3 has only a handful of civs, and you have to buy the expansion pack to use any native american civs. There are 3 long campaigns each with 5 minute missions in the place of a ton of short campaigns and a few individual missions. The first campaign was just silly. Magic. No kidding, magic. In the first campaign you have to find the fountain of youth and destroy it to keep a secret organization from using it's powers for evil or something. It sounds like some sort of bad sci fi. Another thing that irritated me when I played was that everything is so... big. The inability to zoom out combined with the fact that every soldier in my army is half an inch tall means that there is very little room on the screen. Not only that, but the maps are very small too. I found myself quickly running out of room to build, and, when I just started and was playing on the easier levels, found myself accidentally destroying an enemy because my guards went rouge. That's another problem. AOE 1 had that command list where you could pick formations, and set units to patrol, guard, escort, or just not attack anything. That's all gone in AOE III. If you want to guard your base with troops, you have to constantly pull them back to keep them from following a trail of retreating enemies back to their home base. In this version, instead of just reducing troop training time, troops train in squads up to 5. Personally, I have no objection to this change though, it saved me one time because I had to train soldiers while under attack, and if they had been coming out 1 by 1 they'd have been slaughtered. And then there's the realism. I'm sorry, but if your unprotected fleeing screaming villager can take over 15 BULLETS TO KILL, there is something seriously wrong. Bullets are incredibly underpowered in this game. Even after buying a special upgrade that gives me massive bonus damage versus villagers, it still took way more bullets than it realistically should have. A game where bow and arrow > gun is one where the laws or reality are warped. There are 2 things in AOE III that keep me from giving it a 2 or 3. The first one is the home city option. Though it isn't exactly ""Age of Empires"" style, it did a nice job of motivating me to keep playing. After all, I can't just stop with a level 9 home city, I have to go to 10. And after that, why not 15? or 50? Another thing that was fairly well done was the graphics. I don't mean the troops. They all look like a mess of colored triangles. And the buildings just look like buildings. Nice, but nothing to write home about. I'm referring to the thrill I get from positioning 16 cannons in a circle around his town center and firing, watching pieces of it fly 50 feet into the air and land in a shattered heap on top of the mess that used to be a colony. The physics in the game, though also somewhat unrealistic, (Houses appear to weigh nothing, a 20 foot long chunk that must weigh at least 1 ton can be blasted straight up into the air and come back down as if it were a lego brick) are very fun and visually interesting. All in all, this is an okay game, but if you are expecting Age of Empires III, you won't get it. This is just another rts.",HwoDragon

On a bad day this can result in me not being able to finish any of the games that I start. There are explicit and implicit penalties to this kind of thing happening, which make progress very difficult.

I often like to squeeze in a game during halftime while watching a real match, and hey, if I have to spend 5 min just to find a game, I'm not gonna bother.- Intermittently get 0 coin for completed matches.- Some tournaments randomly get stuck, unable to start the next round and unable to forfeit and restart. For some people I've seen on the EA forums, this has happened on all available tournaments, effectively eliminating that particular vector of coin generation.- Stuck in a low division despite winning title/promotion multiple times. This means I'm often mismatched in terms of squad quality and opponent skill level. It's not fun for me to dominate some newbie with a bronze team until he rage quits 20 min into the game.Sorry EA, you really shot yourselves in the FUT this time round (Sorry, I'll show myself out).The year hasn't even ended and I'm pretty much over this season of FUT.

Let's be honest though a good majority of people purchase this game for the multiplayer. Being that MW3 used the same engine and nearly all the same people worked on the game I expected it to be similar to MW2 for the most part. Maybe a MW2.5 even, and I was ok with that because the maps and the game play were really solid. You had a good mix of maps, meaning that the cartography of the maps were balanced in what you could do. If you liked run and gun you could play that style. If you liked to snipe, the map layouts on some maps were brilliant for that but they did include areas that you could run and gun. One map like this would be Fuel in MW2...minus the rock you could hide in obviously. Fast forward to today and as someone that enjoyed sniping, I feel that the cartography of the maps in MW3 are so boxy and corridor like that the only style of play style that is effective is run and gun. The elevation difference in the maps just doesn't seem to be that of the MW2 map Estate or in MW Creek. I'm not saying there needs to be open maps like MW2 Wasteland but maps like Fuel, Creek, Estate, High Rise, Afghan, Derail, Rundown and Underpass would be nice to have in the multiplayer. I feel like those maps had more of an organic feel to them and there were wide open areas and some not so open areas so you could snipe if you wanted but you could also run and gun. This lack of elevation change makes a lot of the multiplayer maps seem like the same thing over and over again just difference scenery. Out of the current set of maps there isn't one that I feel has that, oh this is going to be a classic map down the road and that isn't good from a multiplayer standpoint. Hopefully with DLC they can go back to the drawing board and rethink their cartography to give the maps a bit more of what they did in past games.",jmugg

Но проблема не в самом сюжете, а в низко мотивации персонажей, логика Дауда вообще за гранью моего понимания. В первую очередь люди сами творят что и как им делать, Чужой и сила что он предлагает, был лишь катализатором для свершения каких либо поступков, но никак не причиной их свершения. Формально логика Дауда напоминает мне логику уже выше упомянутой Мизулиной(ребенок пришел в школу и расстрелял одноклассников - виноваты жестокие игры уууууу. Нет блин это не так работает, игры могут послужить катализатором, но не причиной. Причина расстройства обычно куда глубже чем банальность вроде жестоких игр). Билли мотивацией не владеет вообще, ну то есть вот прям совсем, либо я чего-то не понимаю. И как я уже сказал игра слишком короткая, слишком, что так-же на пользу не идет, но это лично моя придирка.Для крикунов что игра не сходится с Лором, советую углубится в Лор поглубже и все волшебным образом сойдется, так что тут тоже претензий не вижу.В итоге могу сказать что DoO волшебное, но к сожалению краткое приключение. 910",DrDRA

Without spoilers, the story itself barely matches that which was represented in advertising, and stretches on only for the sake of inflating the game out, so has not to be a total joke SP content wise. The story could easily be condensed down to 6 missions, without losing anything.If this had been released has a separate spin-off, like Reach, this would have been O.K. in my book, but has a numbered Halo release, it's disappointing. The lack of Master Chief missions alone brings this review down by two pointsGame-play itself isn't bad at all, with two exceptions:For one, your fellow A.I. Spartans are idiots, who will walk right into your field of fire, while you're obviously plugging away at a target, among other things of equal idiocy.For two, many of the major climatic points of individual missions are handled by way of cut scene, rather than leaving it to the player to ""make the kill"", leaving the player with a feeling of disconnect at times.Overall though, if you just want to shoot stuff, the game is good for that. Never the less remove another point for the idiot teammates lack of player involvement in key events.Graphic wise, the game looks pretty good. Sound isn't bad either. Neither are spectacular however, so I have nothing else of note to say on either.Levels do tend to get repetitive though. Although the scenery changes, pretty much each mission is more or less the same, with the same basic  repeating ""boss fight"" sprinkled in every so often. (It's literally the same boss, over and over.) Minus another point for the repetitive, shallow level design.That leaves it at a final rating of 6. Unfortunately, since this website has turned into a mindless, emotion driven 10 vs 0 rating war, people trying to make a buy decision probably shouldn't really go by the overall score, much less many of the ""reviews"". I would strongly suggest finding a friend with a copy, or renting.

Unlike World of Warcraft, whose end-game focuses on grinding for gear that will be obsolete in a few months, progress in EVE actually matters from one patch to the next. The tradeoff is a steep learning curve and slower progress, but in my opinion it's worth it. Unlike PVP in other MMOs, battles come down to more than who has the better gear, or bigger ship. Most of the ships in the game are viable in PVP, which is nice, since it lets you fly pretty much whatever you want. Another great aspect of the game is the sheer volume of options. You can be a miner, an industrialist, a business executive, an entrepreneur, a pirate, a mercenary, and you can switch between them more or less at will. I suppose the biggest drawback to the game is the pace. You can only learn skills, which affect how well you use equipment, etc., at a set rate, which continues even when logged out. However, I find this makes the pace of the game much more relaxed than in other ""grind grind grind"" MMOs. Oh, another great incentive for progressing in the game is that, when you start making enough in-game money you can buy game time with the in-game currency. Or, if you want to be able to make a big purchase right away, you can sell game-time for in-game money in the game itself, which means you don't have to deal with shady gold farmers. Overall, I'd say that EVE takes much more patience than other MMOs, and isn't for everyone, but is much more rewarding.",BradA.

After civ5 one had to see this coming, since good old Sid seems to have a new philosophy: ""streamlining"". Oh you gotta learn to fear this word. It basically means they are taking a great game, stripping it of most of what today is apparently considered ""complex"" by the average gamer, and pumping it up with cool graphics. This new xcom is not a terrible game, to be honest. It is playable, it is also vaguely enjoyable for some time. But after you stop and think that the intro cutscene probably takes more space on your HD than the whole original game UFO defence, you start wondering. So, lets see. 1) No random maps. It does get old, fast. Aliens are placed in the exact same places. So, if you get the same map, it's a breeze to complete (and it's very boring). 2) more or less the same tech tree as in the original UFO. Now this was a letdown. So you have the usual laser techs, autopsies, some fighter techs. There are two more armors (which you will never use if you know whats good for planet earth) compared to the original, and that's as ""modern"" as it gets. Oh yeah and plasma, the mid-late game uber tech. I remember not developing plasma in the old Ufo just because I liked the idea of human soldiers in their blue personal armors and armed with mankind's best laser wapons, so yeah, I'm doing the same in this one. Game is easy anyway. 3) No inventory for soldiers. I'll pause a sec here. So now you may equip one main weapon, one secondary weapon, and ONE extra item. One. Extra. Item. Next time you have to decide if you want to bring ONE grenade OR wear a nanofiber vest under your armor, just remember the magic word: streamlining. It's not b******t, it's streamlined. See how easier it is to accept. Streamlined, I'm starting to like the sound of this. 4) No more Time Units. Now, this is sort of a meh. It's different from the original, not necessarily worst. It makes the game VERY boardgamish, like I don't know, bloodbowl, or necromunda. I like bloodbowl and necromunda. Actually, one of the games that comes to my mind A LOT while playing this XCOM is the pc version of bloodbowl. THe game also plays a lot like a blood bowl game, including the ""hmm should I or should I not blitz that guy"" feeling (if you played bloodbowl then you now what I mean. If not, well go play bloodbowl! Now!).5) Only one base. Very streamlined. 6) max of 6 squad members at a time. Oh now this is SO streamlined! Old XCOM was like 14? 16? and NO, it was not tedious, it was damn fun. It's a war, you are saving earth from an alien invasion! and you get a plane that can carry only six men?? 7) overall tactical combat is faster and cooler (cooler, not better..),and, yes you guessed it, streamlined! no more crouching, aim or snap shots (or auto), you got cameras following your dudes all over the place, cutscenes when you get out of the skyranger, cutscenes when you first meet a group of aliens, cutscenes when you leave the mission, cutscenes when you RETURN TO BASE after the aforementioned mission..no, I'm not kidding, there is a cutscene for almost every tech, autopsy, live alien interrogation. Only cutscenes in this game probably take more space on my HD than all the games I played in the 1990-2000 period. 8) soldier promotion. A random class is awarded to your soldiers upon completing their first level. Cool, I though at first. So if my rookie kills his first alien from a distance, he'll become a sniper for having demonstrated his particular aptitude with long range etc etc.. no, not at all. It's random. So no more ""this guy is a sniper because you decide his stats are good for a sniper class. No, he IS a sniper, he can only use a sniper rifle. Also, when soldiers level they increase their 4 stats (old ufo were like 8 but hey! streamlined!).So bottom line, not an awful game, it has it's moments. As a successor of the greatest classic series of all times, it fails. Some would say miserably. Will be all but forgotten in a few months, while UFO and Terror from the deep will proudly sit in my pc forever, reminding me of how scary and hard and awesome saving earth in 640x480 may be. So tell you what Firaxis, I wanted to be wise and analyze and examine and think this out before voting. But then I decided to streamline my thoughts, so you get a 3 (because I played it a bit and it's not total crap)When in a tactical simulation you may choose between 15 hairstyles for your soldiers but you can't crouch, something's terribly wrong. Or streamlined.p.s. Firaxis is paying royalties to the Warhammer 40k brand I hope. ALL your soldiers and equipment look like space marine stuff. Even in their light beginner crappy armor and armed with a lousy assault gun, they look like uber cool Ultramarines with bolters blazing",Megatanis

With well mapped keys (I don't like the default layout), you don't even think about it any more. It all just flows naturally and smoothly. The NPC AI is a bit on the stupid side and if you don't just rush into a crowd, it's pretty easy to pick them off one at a time by luring them where you want, but there are enough clusters of enemies to make this occasionally challenging until you find the best path through them.

LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is a game that involves over 100 Marvel characters with familiar settings, looks and styles. LMSH features a lot of game mechanics such as the ability to drive vehicles in the air, water and ground. It features a hub world known as LEGO New York City which is where you can find Character tokens, golden bricks and hidden Deadpool levels. In each level you have a stud meter from which if you collect enough studs you earn Tru Believer status, also you need to collect the 10 mini kits hidden in each level. This game has also problems, the plot of the game doesn't feel very good when you move along, even though you and the villains team up in the end it feels very anticlimactic.

None-the-less, its whopping success is, for the greatest part, due to the winning comparison with the past two games of the series. The main quest, along with the well-designed guild quests, finally gives the player a good reason to play through the game in its entirety. The graphics, although very good on their own, are clearly a major overhaul of Oblivion's graphic engine, while the game's world is literally filled with beauty and ancient Norse lore, as it offers magnificent landscapes and a nice blend of towns, fortresses, burial sites and, for the first time, well-characterized dungeons scattered throughout Skyrim. The music score fits in well, while the general voiceover is not really something that will be remembered, even though with some exceptions. Besides, the attention shall now be paid to the cons of Skyrim. In the long run, most of the radiant quests encountered in the game turn out to be relatively shallow and menial, having your character (as for guild quests) become the chief of all of them after a bare set of three or four tasks. The feeling you'll have is that of a wondrous world partly filled with tacky quests and with a barren replayability factor; in addition, the perks are mostly useless, being a blatant old fashioned rpg facade with no real impact on the gameplay. In spite of these major quirks, however, the game works quite well, provided you are into the realm of fantasy lore.

Hey Shep I like Joker and Edi too but you really need to get back to work, seriously you can't just stand here forever, Shep, HEY SHEP JUST MOVE WHAT""S WRONG WITH YOU.Ok, seriously I just finished this game, Man I am not in a real great mood now. Let me start by saying Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 were some of the best examples of video games of all time. This game made me want to smash things so many times as I played it I probably shaved a couple years off my life from the rage. If it had been any other game I would have stopped playing and uninstalled it, unfortunately this was supposed to be Mass Effect so I did not give up cause that's what you do in Mass Effect. From a technical stand point I am unimpressed. I've read that it is a visual improvement over 2, I think I missed that part of the game, maybe it was on Jack's mission cause I missed that one. The controls are terrible. Why does shift do so many things? I have a keyboard in front of me, it has a ton of keys can I use them please? So many times I tried to pick something up just to go flying through the air, other times I was in a hurry cause, you know, impending galactic destruction, and I'd slam straight into a door while mashing the E key, didn't work. At one point I decided it was a stupid irritation to have to find the M key in the dark with my not that side of the keyboard hand so I said hey tab doesn't do anything so I went to the options menu and looked, hmm can't change the Map key huh? That's pretty much idiotic. Of course there's the whole thing where in combat I'd be in cover and try to move to different cover and instead jump over the cover straight into the line of fire, or I'd be shooting things and all that and then just stand up and get my head blown off. All that really increased the overall experience for me. Then there's the screwy behavior during conversations. People teleporting from place to place, or being just plain invisible. Then there's the constant flashes of characters during conversation where they just randomly appear for a split second. Now none of these dialogue are game breakers, just things that completely break your disbelief suspension. No the game breaker is how, as many people have already said, this is not my Shep, this guy says random crap that I don't understand and often doesn't even mean the same thing as what I picked, of course usually that's not much of a problem because I'm usually not given any options.I did think most of the voice acting was good, except that reporter chick, I'm sure they'll get it in editing. Oh yeah and that whole DLC thing, that's pretty ridiculous, gluttons.Now, on to the real problems. Mostly of course revolving around the ending. My God, you people don't deserve a nickle you made as a result of your initial fan base. I can see uninvested new comers being alright with this, with me however, that was my Shepard you destroyed, and was my hours upon hours of work you disregarded in that two minute waste of space ending cut scene. This was without a doubt the best part of the whole experience for me. So I get there, I talk to the stupid kid that tells me that absolutely moronic story I assume he made up on the spot and attempt to figure out which options the directions represent, so I walk up to the power conduit, first option I looked at and bam the **** bug apparently works here to, my feet are nailed to the floor I guess, so even though this is not the option I want I'm forced to shoot the conduit cause I can't walk around anymore, maybe there's a limit to the number of steps you can take throughout the game. Fortunetly turns out all three endings are the same thing anyway so who cares, I'm not playing it again was a waste 90+ hours anyway, 90 cause the ending negates all three games.So here's the short and sweet, this got a four because I suspended my bias and the crushing blow this game was to a former fanboy, I wanted to put a zero. If you're a fan of this series, pirate this one, they don't deserve any money for it. Hope Bioware goes down in flames.VerdictPiece of CrapP.S.

The main campaign I believe lasts about 3h with a great replay factor. Note: 9.0.[History]The story mode is something fantastic, the game can show us an adventure of our protagonist Square and his friends only with shapes and beats, there is only one word pronouncement throughout the whole plot and it's this one: @%&*! . That is, for lack of dialogues, the game got heavy on the animations and sounds and the result is a show apart.The mode works similar to the Super Mario World map, but there are lots of interactions and little minigames, nothing difficult or challenging, but it's fun to walk between stages.[Graphics]The graphics are simple, there is no extraordinary effect. But they knew how to make nice shapes and colors with effects and animations at the point, leaving everything very harmonious, nothing out of the ordinary, the union of all these things makes the graphics very interesting.[Sounds]There's nothing to talk about. Simply amazing, the songs are cool and lively beats, they are not cloying and the tracks are unique. It would make it easy for the CD to sell in the stores (if we had in the 80s / 90s years).[Gameplay]The proposal is quite simple: we are a baby blue square and our goal is to dodge everything that is pink, the motto is: ""Pink is bad."" We can walk in all directions and give a dash, at the time dash we are immune. There is no shot, combo, special or anything else to get our attention of what matters: the shapes and the beats.The pink shapes sprout on the screen in sync with the music, but although the game is rhythmic, we do not have to follow the beats, our freedom here is very big (or not, because there is time that has so much rose that can not go to many places).[Stages]They spent no effort on building level design, the game could be boring and boring if it were not for the unique stages we encountered throughout the game. Seriously, each stage is a unique experience, we get a taste of want more and not with that feeling of ""ahhhh I'm tired of doing this, it's so boring!"". The stages are abstract, but you can see the reference with several other games, Metal Gear Solid (PS1), Rive Raid and Mario. Still has the theme of 007 and Mortal Kombat.[Difficulty]In fact the game is very challenging, but I did not get to spend much punitive because of the short stages. If we die (touch 3x in pink), we return to the last checkpoint (which has all the time), the problem that if you die 3x gives game over and has to start all over again, this for me was a negative point of the game . There are a lot of people cursing on twitter because of the difficulty of the game. There is the casual mode that makes it easier. The bosses do not have checkpoint and some are difficult, but nothing like trying 2 or 3 times and decorating their movements, as the stages are short, don't gets so punitive.[Multiplayer]It can play the campaign with more people (which should facilitate a lot) and has the Challenge mode where we can play alone, local multiplayer or the internet. I tried the mode and it started ok, but after a while it started to bug (it seemed that the stage was out of sync because I took damage without touching anything and the other players went through the pink without taking damage). I have not played much this way to know if it was because I was playing with Japanese or if you will be recurring.[Replay Factor]We have access to all the songs and we can play any one again, there is a list with the performance note of each stage. Here we can play and play and play the stage until you get a bright and colorful S. Also unlock some cool little things after completing the game.",bbcbreno

The game itself is split betweenHorizon: Zero Dawn may not be a flawless game, but it absolutely is a game that was needed for the open-world genre. With an outstanding new combat system, gorgeous world, and by putting an immense amount of thought and care into the tropes it implements into its world, this game has thrown itself into stark contrast against most of the open-world genre. The game itself is split between indoor and outdoor areas, with the latter being the superior of the two. The lighting in the outdoor areas is stunning, and the excellent work with shadows grounds even the more ridiculous creatures in the forests and grassy plains they're in. In terms of aesthetics, this game is untouched by any in terms of quality except for possibly Uncharted 4. This especially works in favor of this game when it comes to the more basic mechanics like the stealth. Despite it being extremely limited, the grass is the only thing possible to hide in, the visuals stop the mechanics from becoming unforgivable. It's much easier to get sucked into the experience in this game rather than a game with less polished visuals and audio. However, despite the visuals doing their best, the stealth mechanics do get stale eventually. They function virtually identically every time they're introduced, and due to their simple nature, feel inferior to the more open-ended stealth mechanics of games like Metal Gear Solid V. The combat, on the other hand, needs no outstanding visuals to sell itself. Against the robots, this combat system is one of the greatest systems ever made. By giving each weakpoint a functional use, and removing that use with each weakpoint Aloy knocks off, it gives every battle a unique ebb and flow, and when the battle shifts to Aloy's favor, it feels like you're overpowering a giant titan. The human combat is much less impressive, the humans don't take advantage of the game's systems or do anything interesting in terms of attacks or strategy, yet the combat still simple fun in its own right. The worst moments of the combat, are never unforgivable. Walking down a hallway and stopping to shoot a few mindless human enemies may not be technically impressive, but can be fun for the brief periods of time its introduced. Luckily, multiple story missions do use the robots as enemies, leading to many unique moments rarely seen in other games. The Point of the Spear is extremely good at giving the player the freedom to experiment with the game's mechanics on their own, which makes everything the player learns feel organic, and the Mountain that Fell is an outstanding mission because it puts the player in new environments to fight the robots, instead of the regular tight corridors and hallways. The cauldrons, while being an interesting idea, often fall short of being anything special, due to the basic nature of their puzzles. Often in 3D games, and even in extremely recent ones such as Breath of the Wild, the nature of puzzles will be introduced slowly, so the mechanics feel familiar and difficult puzzles never feel overwhelming. Early in Breath of the Wild, the player is taught that freezing gears will result in the platforms they're connected to to stop moving. Later, there's a shrine where the player has to figure out which gear is connected to which platform and when to freeze the platforms to get the chests and still be able to get to the end of the shrine. Similarly, there is a puzzle in Horizon, where the player has to figure out how to get from one platform to another using cogs, yet the puzzle isn't built up much at all, as this is the only time where the game brings up being able to switch the direction of the cogs by hitting the light in the middle. Despite the lackluster puzzles, however, the cauldrons are amazing at creating an atmosphere, and the battles at the end of them are always top notch and outstanding at getting the player to think quickly in tight spaces, so the experience evens out. The side quests all have interesting stories, but they unfortunately fall into the same trap of following the trail of purple on the ground, so in my experience they are quite repetitive to complete one after another. The main story is intriguing, and makes the player always want to experience more, thanks to how well it controls information. For every piece of information revealed, there's a new question asked, always a new mystery to solve. This is almost a downside, however, because the story requires constant attention, doing anything besides following it breaks its pacing. There is very little downtime in the story and therefore the player will either follow the story and not do what they wish, or they will do what they wish, such as explore or do side quests, and it will break the flow of the story and remove the dramatic tension. This never ruined my enjoyment however, and despite its flaws, in my opinion Guerrilla has made an outstanding game, and a must-play for PS4 owners, so I'm going to have to give this game a strong 8 out of 10.",MannWithNoEyes

Everything from the voice acting to the real emotion of the characters wouldn't look out of place in the cinema, that's how convincingly real this game is. There aren't a great deal of plot twists until the very end, but when it does come it is quite surprising. The sole complaint about this game is it's lack of 'lasting appeal'. All though you can go back to a few chapters before the end and replay the end a few times to unlock of the ending cutscenes, this won't be as enjoyable as your first playthrough when you'll be entirely immersed in the story. More than likely, you'll be trading this in a week or two after purchase, after finishing an immaculate story and completing a relatively easy trophy list.

They did the original COD, COD2, and COD4. All of them absolute hits, pushing the envelope further every single time. Think of them as the creative geniuses of the genre. Treyarch - an industrial bulk game development shop (""focusing on AAA quality next generation games"" as per their own website). AAA as in subprime AAA? They have done no less than 25 games so far - not a single one of them being a success (including COD2). They are basically the whore studio of Hollywood and they are the kind of guys you hire to develop a crappy little game to go with a big budget movie (e.g. Spider-Man 2). Look up either studio on Wikipedia to learn more about them. As such, you should not be surprised that CODWAW was not named COD5, since it is more of an expansion pack for COD4. Basically Treyarch decided that they are indeed incapable and unworthy of contributing to the COD franchise, but to nonetheless milk the captive audience, they put out some garbage while the guys at Infinity Ward are working on the next truly innovative installment. Factually, CODWAW is basically a few more missions set in WWII and powered by the old COD4 engine. There are new fire effects - exciting for 2007 but embarassing in 2008, at a time when we have Far Cry 2. If you watch up close the grass burn, the grass object is simply shrunk and is given a black coloration while emitting smoke. And only some objects can burn; and there's no catching fire concept. Now try the same in Far Cry 2. Watch every leaf and every branch get charred, watch how the fire spreads in the savannah, see the AI respond to it, and imagine all the strategies you can apply using it. So now that we've established that the engine brings nothing truly new, let's focus on the actual solo missions. They shamelessly plagiarize COD4 - you will be injured countless times, shot, drowned only to have your good buddy rescue you in a slow-motion scene. There are also two parallel plots that you alternate between. However, the specific missions are extremely heavily scripted. More so than the original COD4. In many instances you're better off going to the right place to trigger the next event than focusing on doing a good job shooting. There's a scene where you man the machine gun on a plane, but that is also incredibly scripted. Overall this plays much more like an interactive movie than a real game - which is a huge drawback. Think of the sniping mission in COD4 - how incredibly immersive it was - there are whole websites with strategies for the last part, right before you get rescued. There is no equivalent here. Its much more point and click. The realism element is missing, and I could not relate to any of the in game characters. Do not buy this game - play COD4 multiplayer and Far Cry 2 single player in the mean time, and await patiently COD6.",ReaderWhoreads

It starts as a childrens' tale with a giggling grandma and similar stuff - and in the second half of the game you suddenfly find yourself on a battlefield with blood all over. While I usually like games with gore, I didn't like it in this game. In fact, it spoiled the experience. How special this game could have been if it simply stayed true to it's fairy tale flair. But no: It has to bring in senseless violence plus a macabre sense of humor (e.g. when you destroy frozen people).Second (SPOILER!!!), it's the ending: I am a Game of Thrones fan so I am not shocked anymore when main characters die surprisingly. But in this game, the girl that's supposed to fall in love with the main character turns out to be the villain and, moreover, the main character dies. This simply breaks with the atmosphere. I've seen many people praising this ""unconventional"" ending, but those are the types of people that always praise if something is different (so you can talk about it and feel good that you like the special thing even though it's stupid). This was a fairy tale and, imo, it should have ended as such. You could have even played it with your children then...Therefore: Just a three out of ten. I was REALLY unsatisfied afterwards.",Maxra

184245,Forza Motorsport 7,XboxOne,8,"For all the fury I read in the user reviews I have absolutely loved my time with Forza 7 so far.

I have to say that I find all of this impotent nerd rage about loot boxes sort of puzzling. Yes there are loot boxes however they aren't vital to game progression, they're relatively cheap and purchased with in game money and whats more Forza goes out of it's way more than any racing game I've played to throw credits at you at every turn. I'll frequently take a car for a blast through Nurburgring Full Circuit on my own, no other cars and get maybe 30,000 just for having 10 minutes of fun. The mods are actually worth buying too, I felt, they give you a variety of different challenges and make each trip out onto the track a little different and engaging. The user score for this game is seriously skewed by people crying over something that is really not that big of a deal whatsoever. Car Collection Tiers are also a big point of contention but again I enjoyed that too, it encouraged me to buy and drive cars I probably would have skipped over entirely before whilst saving up for a Ferrari or something. More to the point people make it sound like cars are entirely unobtainable without hitting that collectors tier but every car in the game is available from the outset for free, you just can't earn credits driving them. I don't see the problem with that set up nor do I see the problem with the loot boxes.Graphically Forza is stunning. The level of detail in the cars is incredible and likely the best yet in any racing game. The tracks are plentiful with multiple layouts each and not only do they look beautiful they are alive with things going on around you. As you bomb down a straight a TV camera might lower on a boom close to your car, a tv helicopter buzzes around over head dipping and rising to get the best shots, the crowds bustle and roar, you can hear music from the stands as you pass them it's all very well designed and some of the scenery around you is positively jaw dropping. It feels less like a static stage to race than an actual location and thats an impressive step forward.The car list is exhaustive and varied. Their claim of the most Porsche, Ferrari and Lambourghinis in a racing game ever is well founded. I'm struggling to think of a Ferrari they don't feature, from the LaFerrari to the 1950s race cars they really do tick nearly every box. Also it was gratifying to see only perhaps 50 or 60 cars out of 700 being DLC. Forza has left a bad impression on me in the past by having far too many cars behind a paywall, that doesn't seem to be the case this year.Forza 7s career mode is a little longwinded but it is punctuated with special events that are nearly always fun to take on and help break up the grind of races the career unfortunately becomes. As such Forza is a game I will pick up for a few hours and put down for a while because it gets a little overbearing. However basically everything you do in this game progresses you in some way which makes dipping in and out still feel rewarding. I can take a few cars for a spin or maybe run off a race series in career mode and by the time I'm finished I will have moved up a few levels, earned some decent credits and gotten a couple of rewards. It hands out its rewards well and keeps you playing to see what you get next.That is a real strength of Forza 7 is its gameplay is engaging, challenging but not unfair and paired up with the sublime presentation it makes you want to do ""just one more race"" or try out ""just one more track"". The addition of Forzathon, special challenges that net you a rare car or driver outfit is also a brilliant idea and more than once I've logged on and not stopped until I've achieved them all. They release new challenges every 2 weeks or so and it's a great idea to give players a constantly refreshing challenge.On the whole if you strip away all of the yelling about loot boxes and complaining about a game trying to take a fresh approach to car collecting you'll notice nobody is really attacking the game too much and for good reason; it's excellent. If you aren't the type to get riled up over such trivial things as lootboxes then what is actually here is a stunning looking, great to play racing game with an gigantic car list and tons of things to do with them.I got this game a little after launch so maybe patching has had an effect but all this talk of bugs is bizarre because I've not ran into a single one and this whining about load times is equally bizarre because I've not really seen one much longer than 10 seconds or so to load the first race and then after that it's pretty quick and easy to flit between different tracks and locations.Overall this is an excellent racing game with stunning graphics with a bizarrely low user score due to people with trustworthy usernames like ""ForzaTrash"" giving it 0/10 in a hilariously unobjective review.",ElSeano89

First off I do say this game has many improvementsI thoroughly enjoy the Mass Effect series and I absolutely could not wait to see what was in store for the galaxy with the foreboding presence of the imminent Reaper invasion and all out extermination of all the organic races. This game had so much building up, so much hype, and at first glance all was going so well...until the ending. First off I do say this game has many improvements from ME2 (storywise and gameplay), I love it how there's more RPG element (leveling, skill trees) and the weapon modding was a very nice welcome which allows you to tailor your guns to different situations. I loved all the cameo appearances from squad mates past and present as well as other characters encountered in past games and including DLC which was very nice. The controls actually seemed a bit worse than 2, I've died so many times due to squad mates being in the way and non-responsive controls. It got really irritating moving from cover to cover or peaking out and being punished for the game having a good 1-2 second delay. I noticed that Shepard can now vault or tumble like Gears of War (I forget if he could do that in 2...) and it seems like Bioware really likes Gears. The galaxy map was just about the same as 2's minus scanning for minerals/resources and having a set amount of probes. However, because the Reapers are out and about it can make scanning annoying. I also liked it how you didn't have a billion squad mates to pick from like 2, and I'm glad to see 3 took a notion of quality vs. quantity. As for the story, I could feel from the start of the game how dark the situation was, and how close the galaxy was to coming closer and closer to failure and ultimate extinction. It got a little irritating dealing with Cerberus a good half of the game, I mean really who is the focus here? Cerberus or the Reapers? Although it was interesting to hear about the humans fighting against themselves as opposed to working together. I also liked making choices to bring the other races together. I thought the story flowed very well, much better than 2's ""out of nowhere"" plot. Everything just kept building up, but then the ending came... Yes, I do have to hop on the growing band wagon and agree that the ending to ME3 was really not that good. I don't have a problem with the three choices you are presented with at the end and that Shepard dies (so sad and sucks he dies!) but I have a major problem with how short the ending is and the lack of closure on all the supporting characters and the general fate and conclusion of the Mass Effect universe. Not to mention I was also greatly disappointed to see, or NOT see, how my preparations for the final assault didn't even make a difference. I was fairly certain I heard Admiral Hackett go from saying, ""We're bogged down"" to ""We're about even"" so I figured maybe this would impact the final mission or ending, but it didn't! So did I make all those choices and finish all those side quests for nothing? I felt nothing but emptiness when the game ended, it reminded me of early reviews of Halo 2 and how many reviewers commented on how the ending left you wanting more. Unfortunately for this series there is no more to be had as it's the last to the trilogy. I find it interesting hearing that the overall dissatisfaction with ME3's ending by many, MANY fans has been well heard, and some has gone so far as to raise a charity to bring awareness and change to 3's ending! Of course Bioware is listening but so far they're saying they have no plans to alter the ending but to only support 3 with future DLC. (Sigh...) I really want to rate this game a 10 as it was enjoyable to play, but the ending just ruins it, especially since your choices and quests during the game have no effect. Because of that, I'm actually having a hard time playing through the game again because I now know whatever I do on the side won't make a difference and won't reward me with extra cutscenes, dialogue, etc. I almost wanna rate this game a 7 but I think that would be a bit steep. Had this game had a perfect ending I would have given it a 10. But that bad ending just creates one hell of a void that really just hampers everything else this game has to offer, and I say all this because this game is an RPG and RPGs are supposed to have critical character and plot development. Overall, good game but not what I had in mind to close such a wonderful series. Here's to hoping future DLC will improve what faults there are.",Plaidman86

What I wasn't expecting was a game that I would require constant internet connectivity with the absence of of a basic single player mode along with an integrated auction house which eliminates all trading games(which sucksss!!!). The mere inability to create custom games that are labeled and available to see and join is a jump in the complete opposite direction of what I consider the best game I have ever played which is diablo 2. Let me remind everyone that the characters in this game are INFERIOR to the classic must have characters of the last game. Really a monk over a paladin? But of course I want to pay for another expansion just to get the cool characters later right? Yes! The auctionhouse itself is a double edged sword as it provides quick easily accessible items which takes all of the fun and struggle out of getting new gear. As nice as it is to be able to get the items that you want quick, if you are a former d2 player you know what I'm talking about. Instead of the market being flooded with every type of item (one man's trash is another's treasure) people would simply not pick up every worthless item they found since the items had to be traded or sold for gold. In my opinion blizzard got too greedy and ruined that whole aspect of the game (which is a HUGE aspect of the game to me). The cap at four heroes per game is also a bummer as that is half the amount of characters allowed in the last game.Of course I could find more things to scrutinize, but I believe I have covered the main points which clearly show I will not be playing this game ten years later or four different times over the span of ten years like I did with the jewel of diablo 2.",angryd3player

218431,Saints Row: The Third,Xbox360,10,"Stupendous. A triumph. First off, gameplay. A man cartwheels down a street, urinating as he proceeds. A blimp crushes a crowd of innocent children.

Like any fine wine, it only improves with time. The carnage, limited at first, starts off bitter, but becomes (I recommend Hennigan's brand wine, by the way), succulent... still a tad bitter but... succulent. It must be experienced to truly understand.Onto graphics. The level of detail is staggering. For, example while driving my BMW, I couldn't help but notice a scratch on the paint (probably from a resentful peasant). The game has drivable BMWs as well, but unlike my real life vehicle, they lack any scratches (detailed though they are).The characters are as interesting as they are varied. A young couple struggles to make ends meet for their autistic child. A portly fellow conceals his kindliness underneath a mask of hatred. A vacationing bear surprises us with a heartrending tale of lost love. They all add up to make the somber world feel lived in, much as an Armani suit expands (ever so slightly) to fit the wearer; a comforting vacancy, as it were.However, as the story reaches its end, there are gut-wrenching moments. Children should not be allowed to see some of the later scenes of the game, and neither should dogs. I say this only because my poodle urinated spontaneously after watching a scene involving a jackhammer and several rats (there is also a stick of deodorant involved but, alas, I cannot discuss why). All of these elements blend together to make something tasteful- exquisite even. It should not be overlooked, but savored. And enjoyed. Thank you.",Snootington

From the moment the player stepped into the bathysphere and Andrew Ryan's voice came over the radio, they were plunged deep into the dark world of Rapture and the twisted tale of the city. Rapture is amazing from every angle. The art style is a stunning blend of old 50s-60s and science fiction underwater utopia. The tainted and tattered visage it gives stirs emotions and raises hairs. Manifesting in this rusty bucket is one of the best stories told in a videogame. The characters are unendingly fascinating and the events that drive the plot powerful. Given that Bioshock is a ""slow shooter"", discovering hidden secrets and old memories is a chilling and exciting experience. Combat is largely frantic here; enemies will be jumping and running about, and blots of fire and ice among the usual hail of bullets will fly in all directions. It is nothing precise and clinical, but it works well given the style of the game. Perhaps the only real fault is the ending part, which was less well executed and rather scrappy. The ending itself was disappointing and only managed to raise eyebrows in cynicism. Fortunately, it only manages to be a tiny speck on an otherwise magnificent experience. A true masterpiece.",Machofella

As a gamer of over 30 years I can tell you the best days of FPS have long since past. These days it is pay to win, pay to advance,  pay for a hat.  Where once FPS required thought and planning, now it is run and gun drop and pop you back.  No costs for death,  No thought required..The best part of Halo was sitting down with my peers and playing together.  By removing split screens, 343 has hollowed out the game. No more can my friends arrive at a house settle in for the day and leave when our fingers are worn and our heads are aching.No longer can I enjoy running missions with my son, instead he has to watch me play or I watch him.  we had so looked forward to running Halo 5 together,  he is old enough to no longer need to be carried and we had planned to put the game on hard and battle our way through together.All of that has been cut to cater to the whims of  online multiplayer,  343i  has disgarded the very people who supported Halo through thick and thin.  We were patient when 343i dropped the ball ref MCC.  We forgave them and looked forward instead of placing blame.yet 343 has abandoned the split screen crowd , not even provided a campaign split screen .this is likely the last 343i game I buy.

Dirt3 isn't dramatically better on either point but it is a step forward for both. If you enjoyed Dirt2 you should get your money's worth from Dirt3--though there do appear to be a few who manage to disagree.Graphics--the Good: It's the Dirt2 engine with environmental effects on top.TL;DR: I'm completely baffled by anyone holding up Dirt2 as superior, either in graphics or gameplay.

If you enjoyed Dirt2 you should get your money's worth from Dirt3--though there do appear to be a few who manage to disagree.Graphics--the Good: It's the Dirt2 engine with environmental effects on top. There's a bit of polish all around--the cars look appreciably nicer, and the water is better--but nothing dramatic. Kudos to Codemasters on optimizations though--while everything looks nicer, I get the same frame rate I did in Dirt2.--The Bad: The overall color palette and set pieces are more subdued--compared to Shibuya or London in Dirt2, Finland's forests look bland and repetitive. Given that there are fewer locations there's less variety in the atmosphere that the added environmental effects don't entirely make up for--they lost a bit of the spice from the previous game.Content--the Good: All the racing types from Dirt2 are here, though Rally and Gymkhana have a bit more prominence than the other modes. Between driving in rain/snow having more cars to choose there's a goodly bit more variety in driving conditions.--the Bad: sure there's more spice in the driving options, but less areas to drive in.I don't mean the tracks--there's definitely more road to drive on--but they've been crammed into fewer locations. The menu navigation isn't nearly as neat as the trailer from Dirt2 but that's not a dealbreaker. Gameplay--the Good: with the difficulty set to advanced, the handling is almost identical to Dirt2. The myriad of driver assists they added made this game way more accessible--for kicks I had my grandpa play it on casual, and to my surprise he enjoyed it. The new weather conditions are a blast to drive in. Gymkhana plays out like Tony Hawk with cars and is a fun addition to the franchise. The flashback system no longer has a delay when activated which makes it much more fluid to use.--the Bad: I'm struggling to think of things they've made worse. Load times are as frequent and as long as in Dirt2--anyone making claims to the contrary has their rose-colored glasses on. Difficulty occasionally too random--I've seen the fastest CPU time fluctuate as much as 7s between playthroughs of the same track. If you're getting this expecting a simulation you might be disappointed, but as a fan of the Dirt series they've raised the bar in nearly every category.Dirt3 isn't a big upgrade, but they took kept the fun from the previous game and added some new modes, content, and weather twists.

Regardless, it is a truly unique game. For those expecting the standard, stellar Halo-style experience they will be somewhat disappointed. The art style and color palette are totally different from Halo 3. The cut-scenes have a more cartoon-like feel to them, and the game is amuchdarker in tones. The story-telling is vastly different, but once you get used to it only then can you appreciate it. ODST slows down the fast pace of Halo story telling to focus, in detail, on the episodic encounters of surviving members of an ODST unit. Instead of vast, galactic battles with epic proportions, ODST tells the small-scale story about the lives of brave and honorable men and women who would have otherwise been considered insignificant. ODST takes a mysterious, suspenseful approach in a fantastic tale on how ODST struggle to save Humanity from the invasion of the Covenant. The Human-Covenant War takes a heavier toll as you literally feel and experience the War from a purely human perspective. You dwell among the dark, dead ruins of one of earth's greatest cities: New Mombassa. You can see Covenant ships hovering nearby and laying waste, you see human soldiers scrambling in guerrilla warfare against alien invaders. You can explore the city and uncover interesting side-stories from a civilian perspective of the attack, and you experience -block-tp-block fighting against occupying covenant forces. The stakes seem higher, and I almost wish this game would have been called Halo: ODST so it could have been a $30 tie-in special release in between Halo 2 and Halo 3. I think more people would have appreciated the game more than way, especially with how the plot progresses and then ends. The story is very interesting, and enjoyable. At first I had a hard time actually liking the characters, but as the game continued on I felt like i fit in among them, and I felt for them and connected to them. The music is unique and enjoyable. The gameplay is solid and smooth. The game is challenging and immensely fun.

134476,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings,Xbox360,6,"I really don't understand all the high-scores here. The game is ok, I've played worse in my gaming experience, but this is it. I understand that ""The Witcher 2"" provides a deep and intriguing plot and a bunch of interesting characters you deal with during the game, but we have to remember that this is supposed to be a RPG, not a movie. And, as a RPG, it has more than one flaw. -1-. TheI really don't understand all the high-scores here. The game is ok, I've played worse in my gaming experience, but this is it. I understand that ""The Witcher 2"" provides a deep and intriguing plot and a bunch of interesting characters you deal with during the game, but we have to remember that this is supposed to be a RPG, not a movie. And, as a RPG, it has more than one flaw. -1-. The game tries to trick you into believing it's ""open world"". It's not. You have to ""unlock"" more areas by progressing in the main quest and, while exploring an area, you are forced to follow predefined paths: the mighty witcher simply can't climb a two feet high cliff (unless the designers want you to do so) or pass through a bush. -2-. The stealth system is a joke. You have to manually turn off the lights by targeting them with the controller. 90% of the time spent in stealth mode you are standing still, trying to center the camera on the goddamn torchlights. -3-. The game warns you to drink potions BEFORE combat if you find them too hard. Too bad the witcher isn't also some kind of precog. Everytime you wander in the wild (well, everytime you follow the predefined path in the forest), and i mean EVERYTIME, be prepared to be ambushed by an army of angry monster-dudes popping from the ground to kick your low level ass. So, every game session consists in you going further, being killed, reloading a previous save, drink potions and fight the monsters AGAIN. The second time, of course, the fight is a piece of cake since you know exactly what's going to happen. This goes on and on, until you are high-level enough to have enough tricks to survive an ambush. At this point, potions are only good for boss fights. I don't mind a game being hard, but this is just ridiculous since at low levels this mechanic breaks the game flow and spoils any fun. -4-. Crafting system: another joke. Again, you might be the mighty witcher, but you can't craft a simple leather armor without visiting a dwarf and asking ""Can you please craft this jacket for me?"". You end up gathering an insane amount of crafting materials, most of them utterly useless, just to store them in an inn. Then you get a schematic for a good sword. You have to go back to the inn, check the materials, pick up what you need and only that or you'll be overcumbered, then go again to the dwarf, ask him to craft it, then you have your sword. Provided you didn't forget anything or you'll have to make all the trips again. -5-. Some quests are poorly designed, meaning that even reading your journal it's not clear what you have to do. I.e. in the first chapter you are asked to go to the inn to gather infos on the Kayran and the journal points you there. You end up talking to EVERY SINGLE person in that damn inn, just to find out you had to talk to YOUR FRIENDS about topics totally unrelated in order to trigger the Kayran to appear. Lol? -6-. Talking about sloppy designers work? You can rob a vendor's chest just in front of him and re-sell him HIS STUFF while he's smiling. You weren't allowed to do that in Oblivion and we're talking about a 2006 game (yeah, that's 7 years ago) -7-. Someone here praises the graphics. I assume you all have a different Xbox360 than mine, since the graphics are good, but not stunning on my machine. Everything in distance is blurred, and the facial expressions of characters are far from detailed like, i.e., Mass Effect.- 8-. Strong language, lol. Saying sometimes ""c0cksuck3r"" or ""sh1t"" doesn't make a fantasy game ""mature"", it makes it just ridiculous. Kids will surely enjoy that, but I'm 33 years old, I hear enough swearing IRL and i can say those words without having my mom scolding me. --There are more minor flaws, that I will not list here since I also want to say something good about ""The Witcher 2"". Don't get me wrong, this game is not terrible, as I said before I've played worse. But it's far from good, and for sure not ""great"" nor ""gorgeous"". It has its moments: if you're looking for a deep and well developed plot, you will sure enjoy this game. The story is really interesting and that's what will get you to complete the game, maybe 2-3 times to see the consequences of different choices. In this, ""Assassins of Kings"" is really good, even better than ""Dragon Age: Origins"". BUT, to get to it you'll have to go through hours of boring and slow gameplay, at least at low levels. To me, that was the fatal flaw: it's a game, it's supposed to be fun and most of the time it's not. If I'm looking for a deep plot just for the sake of entertainment, well, I have the first season of Game of Thrones on DVD. If you're looking for a good RPG, Skyrim and Oblivion are better. Kingdoms of Amalur is better. The Fallout series are better. Dragon Age: Origins is better. Mass Effect trilogy is better. I'll go as far as saying even Dragon Age 2 is better.

However in order to doHailed as a flawless masterpiece. While definitely deserving of praise during its release, the Ocarina of Time wasn't as perfect as its community believes it to be. It is still something worth playing today, preferably with the 3DS version.Points against:Numerous fetch missions - The game itself would be a masterpiece if relegated to dungeons and exploration. However in order to do anything in the game, an NPC will demand you fetch some type of item or the quest line will forcibly require you to go and hunt down a tool necessary to reach a dungeon.Lack of direction - A lot of finding the right way to go in Zelda games is primarily luck based, Ocarina is no exception. Once the Owl stops feeding you directions, the expansive world area becomes a tedious adventure in finding things that you haven't done yet, and then finding the NPC that requires finding the item that you need to successfully advance. The later-game area is by far one of the most frustrating and confusing areas to traverse with little help in game other than to just attempt everything.Illusion of Difficulty - Most of the game isn't difficult, but really a period of waiting and countering. Dungeons are complex and rewarding, but often the slog of forced battles can become tedious and often just result in a player getting exhausted. In longer dungeons this becomes especially prevalent. Even the bosses are mostly just guard-and-wait type enemies.Upsides:Dungeons and Exploration - The world of Hyrule is vast and immediately accessible, and encourages a lot of trial and error. Once the exploration becomes a mandatory event, it does lose a lot of luster.Content - The game is lush with content and items to collect and things to see and explore. With fishing, horse racing, poe-catching, even though there are some frustrating moments to those events, are a healthy distraction to the late game's issues regarding its lack of direction.Narrative - The series strongly continues to be flush with vibrant light scenes and dark tones, characters are engaging and perform their roles in the story without becoming overbearing or losing interest.Iron Knuckle - Best inclusion of an enemy. While most monsters are pursuit or guard-and-wait, the Iron Knuckle is a pure reactionary enemy that genuinely challenges the player with each encounter.

Yes, the release was a debacle - for a few hours, anyway, and only for basement-dwelling losers who simply couldn't waitA lot of people have taken it upon themselves since this game released to bash it pretty relentlessly; these people approached the game with a very strong sense of entitlement, with very high expectations, and with nostalgia for Diablo II filtering their experience.  Yes, the release was a debacle - for a few hours, anyway, and only for basement-dwelling losers who simply couldn't wait until Tuesday morning to play the game.  For the rest of us, it is a complete non-issue.Of course Blizzard's servers couldn't handle the midnight launch, because this launch was an anomaly. D3's launch was like the release of The Avengers; you and everyone you know saw it Thursday night at midnight, just like everyone else.  That has never, ever happened with the release of an online game, and Blizzard very reasonably expected only a fraction of everyone who pre-ordered the game to log in immediately.  Buying and running enough servers to accommodate literally every person on the face of the planet who bought the game would be incredibly expensive, and merely hours after launch, all those extra servers would become totally unnecessary.  So yes, the launch wasn't perfect, but it's not really fair to place all the blame on Blizzard either.The game requires an internet connection at all times during play.  Part of this is Blizzard's attempt at anti-piracy measures.  Mostly it's just the way the game is structured.  Do people complain about MMORPGs that don't have offline-modes?  Of course they don't, because MMOs are built around online play.  You know what Diablo III is built like?  An MMORPG.  It has a real-time auction house, for crying out loud.  Yes, the other Diablo games set a precedent for being offline single-player games with online options, but that was over a decade ago, and this is now, and D3 is not a single-player game.  It is a multiplayer game with a single-player option, and as far as I'm concerned, that's perfectly fine.  I'll be honest, I've never had much fun playing Diablo or Diablo II offline.  For me they were mostly boring games that only became fun when other people were involved, and I don't think my experience is terribly unique.So how is Diablo III?  Pretty awesome.  The graphics aren't cutting edge, but they're certainly not terrible, and the game will run on just about any computer, meaning more people to play with; it's the same strategy Blizzard has been using with WoW for years, and so far, it seems to work.  For the nostalgic types, yes, the game is still isometric, items and gold still make the same noises when they drop, and for the most part, Blizzard has very skillfully refined and updated the gameplay formula that made the previous Diablo games so much fun, without ever losing the spirit of it.  Each class is unique and fun to play, the variety of gear is mind-boggling, leveling feels faster and more rewarding, and the skills and skill runes make classes far, far more customizable than they were previously.  Even wailing on monsters in this game feels better than it did before (and it looks and sounds better too).All in all, Diablo III is a fun game, especially if you have friends.  It's definitely a step in the more casual direction compared to its predecessors, but that just means it's different, not inherently bad.  If you like dungeon-crawling old-school RPGs, you'll like Diablo III.  You could certainly be doing worse things with your time, like Denial-of-Service attacking an online game server at its midnight launch or writing ultra-negative reviews of said game based solely on your own ignorance.",agentjones

Slightly ruined by Konami.Too much game!The complexity depth and scope of this game is hard to sum up or indeed fathom.Built on the foundations of earlier games and incorporating mechanics and ideas from those titles as well as some brand new ones, all of this placed in TWO massive free roaming combat arenas.Its almost too much game! Not in the way that there are too many “collectables” or stuff like that to pick up but in a way that makes you feel like you are just one man trying to defeat a massive army.Konami are EVIL!I am a fan of these games and played them back when they came out. But when this game came out I was not a fan!Like many people I was on the Konami sucks train and was shocked and appalled by the way the game locked away the stuff you earn and offered it to other players to steal! Then they announced that you would be able to “insure” your stuff by paying them! Konami were essentially using Mafia style strong arm extortion racketeering on it faithful players!!That said I never had any problems unless it couldn't sign in to the servers and on my second play through its a lot less shocking. I know the stuff I don't just sell immediately might get “locked” and I will have to wait (like a FB p2p game) to unlock that stuff again or just get new stuff. Also I like making my base super deadly and watching people fail to take it down, then being like “wow good job” when someone actually does!What Story?!I know allot has been said about the story, but I think after all the other games its not so bad to keep the story minimal. The fact that it is in between games with strong stories and is trying to tie them together, means it finds itself restricted in what it can do. I mean they're not going to kill Snake or Ocelot are they? The fact that this is a “filler” game trying to fit in is evident in the two regions you visit. I love the Africa area and its crazy to think that the pixilated top down original game and this are basically the same thing in the same place!Plus points:Great gameplay.Good Graphics.Stable FPS.Large world.Many weapons / items to choose from.Lots of vehicles drive / get dropped in.The whole supply drop / bombardment system.The Fulton system.Different characters to play as.The buddy(s).Kooky weirdness and hiding in boxes.Minus Points:KonamiBadly implemented pay to play system that nobody needs or wants and was just an attempt at extortion by Konami.Have to connect to bad servers or your stuff is stolen by Konami.Bad (unrealistic) physics (its not a simulator).Some buggy gameplay (Its fine when you're used to it).Some annoying gameplay (being exposed / attacked in a cut scene), only in story missions.Occasionally unrealistic AI responses.Long traversals to / in between destinations.Quiet.9/10When someone on PC hacks the game and locks Konami out of it, I'll give it 10/10!",ZardozXerxes

In the previous installations it was simply about saving the world from a mysterious enemy, the Locust however in this finally, you will look more deeply into the lives of the team of soldiers that have survived this long, with some happy endings and well, lets just say, some not so happy. As I finally defeated the main boss and I watched the ending cinematic I was in awe at the revelation that had just unfolded and the amazing soundtrack just added to that fact. I would simply play the game all over again just to hear that soundtrack. Although I found Gears of War 2 harder to get into with the plot line and game play, I found that I had no problem getting into Gears of War 3. This makes it an excellent starting point for those new to the series but I would advice said people to play the previous two games first as the finally is a lot more shocking and awe worthy if you know all about the main characters and the people surrounding them. Multiplayer however I never got into, it was a bit frustrating with the Gears combat system, but it will depend on your taste. Horde however is the next best thing to the Campaign and I found me and my friends staying up late into the night fighting off endless amounts of Locust and Lambent while laughing as I was continuously downed by the Boomers.

I love space operas, definitely. Vast space, the feeling of being a tiny spec in an endlessly large ocean. Industriously burrowing away at an asteroid for hours at a time while I read a book. Stacking up credits. Improving my lot one ore bit at a time.EvE online appeals to all these sentiments. Space is compounded by achingly beautiful visuals and the well measured soundtrack bouncing through the halls of my ship.Against other mmorpg's EvE stands well apart. There's no levelling arms race at play to motivate you, no endless level grinding to ruin your nights. Your motivation is primarily in how much of the universe you want to turn over. It's all under your own volition away from any peer pressure.But EvE suffers in some development choices. Once you have created your character and jumped into the game you land ass first in a space ship in the middle of who-knows-where. ""What the hell is going on?"" and ""What am I doing here?"" are the first couple of questions to go through your head. You just automatically happen to be in a space ship from the off. Yes, this is exactly what I'm playing this game for but there is no build up at all! It would have been simple to develop a story line over half an hour or so while the character finds his way to a ship and launches into space. All manner of back history could subtly and simply be woven into these first few minutes. Alas instead you are faced with a half hour tutorial that pretty much covers everything there is to do in the game, ever. I have thus far(this is my 5th odd return to the game) logged out twice during this particular stab at the tutorial and I'm pretty sure it's all down to not having any emotional investment in my character or ship.This build up would of course need a third person walk around section. Something that EvE lacks. All that time you spent creating your character and choosing nice clothes boil down to the thumbnail image attached to your ship. To create a physical presence and platform for the characters is absolutely necessary but likely to be part of a long development process.Aside from that, I want to be able to land on planets. These beautiful orbs just hang in space enticing you towards them but on approach they are to be found totally void of function. You can't land, mine or colonise. What use is a space opera without a home world to counterpoint off? Aside from that and back to my first few points, EvE Online has captured the space odyssey feeling perfectly. It just has a few teething problems it needs to get out of the way before it's absolutely immersive. Perhaps by the time I return for the 8th time it will have these all sorted out.",mook

I gotta say the good words were all true.  I loved the presentation of the story (granted the ""remote island"" setting is just a recycled idea from the Far Cry series, which I dock points for) and the advancement of the story kept me playing the game for hours because I wanted to see what happened next.  I also came to like the protagonist of the game, Lieutenant Jake Dunn (referred to in-game only by his call-sign ""Nomad"").  A lot of parts in the game where the pacing slowed down a bit for suspense cued Nomad's thought with great timing.  An example of this is when Nomad ventures deep into the island's mountain.  The trip disrupts communication with his superiors, forcing him to improvise by recording everything he sees through his visor while describing the scenery in the hopes that someone outside can still hear him.  That kind of personal interaction in the story is something I really liked, allowing me to connect to Nomad as a character.  The open-world environment of the fictional Lingshan Islands also allowed for freedom of creativity for the player to complete their mission, whether they want to storm in guns blazing, or engage the nanosuit's cloak to sneak around the back of a building, silently taking down enemies along the way.  That aspect of the game felt rather liberating.  The destructible environments in the game was a breath of fresh air, as I could launch a rocket into a shack hiding an enemy soldier and watch it blow apart from the impact of the shockwave.  However, not all of the objects were destructible, as I found some metal barricades surrounding some huts were completely impervious to all kinds of damage, including times when I rammed into the barricades with a Jeep only to get stopped dead in my tracks and getting the vehicle stuck.  The AI of the enemies is also nearly realistic, with soldiers losing sight of you when you disappear into some bushes or hide in a small pond amidst some foliage.  They also startle and jump back when they suddenly see you appear right in front of them as you grab a soldier by the neck and run off with him into the jungle before anyone knows what just happened.  The full customization of the weapons also added to the creative freedom of the player, especially since it allows you to keep some of your favorite add-ons to your preferred weapons (I loved using a sniper scope on an assault rifle with a silencer that was switched to single-round fire, thus making a secondary makeshift sniper rifle).  One thing I could not get over, however, was the durability of the nanosuit on North Korean soldiers at some points during the game.  Where one or two rockets could completely deplete the energy in my suit to maintain maximum armor, the North Korean Nanosoldiers could take *at least 3* rockets before they died, leading to a slight inconsistency with the gameplay regarding the nanosuit.  Despite all of that, along with some other aspects of the game (especially with the suit's energy depleting a little too quickly), the experience overall was great, with an engaging story, brilliant gameplay, good visuals, and a cliffhanger ending that keeps you wanting more from Nomad.NOTE: I have written a review for Crysis 2 well before writing this one, so I'm already pissed off that Nomad was written off between the two games.  As I've stated in that review, Crytek decided to throw out the human character by killing him off in a bridging comic book series (which has some of the worst writing I've seen) so they can focus on players connecting more to a friggin' AI in Crysis 2 (the so-called Nanosuit 2.0).",AdderTude

I find the online divisions very addictive and keeps me coming back. The negatives are the lag cheats, some people who are rubbish on the game will attempt to lag cheat at times to confuse your defence and keeper and that can become very annoying but not every opponent does that just a sad minority. The other negative is the percentage of getting a black ball superstar are very low and cost 10,000gp a go and you dont make around just over 2k for every  online division game you win and you have contracts to pay out of that wich seem to come around fast, so basically to get enough gps to spin agents they want you to spend money on gold coins wich is 250  gold coins a spin and I think is just over £7 for just over 1000 coins I believe so no thanks I wont by them and instead have to farm in either sim or novice cup wich is very boring. I think there should be higher rewards as you go up the divisions but it stays the same and I also think there should be more v com taurnys added to aquire good gp, as when u completed all the ones there is then u get poor rewards from them there after. Also there should be a way to get the lag cheats banned, a way that konami can see exactly what there were doing with there connection during the vital points of the game, as them lag cheats are chasing people away. Apart from them negatives, I find the game a far better experience than fifa and highly addictive, I have played it every day since the release date and will continue to till next years comes out where hopefully the few negatives I have will been sorted out by then. All in all I would recommend the game and I would say build a strong team before going intoo the divisions online as you may find them tough at 1st but once you make a team you feel happy with the results will come and practice makes perfect.",blitzit

According to Metacritic, fans have been giving this game as low as 4.2 out of 10 while the average critics have rated the game 8.5/10.  Since reception has been scattered, I decided this to be my first review.  These reviews well be broken up into 6 different categories and averaged in the end.  These Categories included: Presentation(concept), Graphics, Sound, Playability(Gameplay), Entertainment, Replay Value(Lasting Appeal).Presentation:  The game is a reboot of a very successful ps2/ps3 series with a strong fan base.  In case you have never played this game, it is a hack and slash like God of War but with a heavy focus on combos.  In this game, you take the role of Dante who is nephilim (have demon half angel) who has recently discovered his brother.  Dante's brother Virgil shows Dante the truth of their existence and what happened to their parents.  This throws the game into your ultimate goal; kill the demon god Mundus and restore order to the world.  This game presents the plot and story in a very cool way.  The story kept my interest and its concept was pretty cool.  9/10Graphics:  This games graphics were very good.  These graphics made most of the characters look real and most of the environments were detailed very well.  Although character design was very well done, the environments were bland.  The environments were detailed but after the first half of the game, i decided everything started to look the same.  Environments used a lot of the same color schemes (mainly Reds and darker colors).  A few of the environments were unique but most seemed to look a lot the same.  These bland environments made me have to focus more on the gameplay and less on the actual experience.  7/10Sound:  Voice acting was top notch.  Almost every voice actor brought the character to life however conversations themselves seemed forced.  With heavy language used and sexual innuendos, the conversations were not as real as i would have liked.  The actors and actresses themselves however proved very in depth voice acting in casual situations but when the characters tried to be serious, they seemed to fall short.  8/10Gameplay:  I had an extremely fun time playing DmC because of the gameplay.  Although with the final level or two i was ready for the game to be over, i was still having fun completing combos and killing so many demons.  The various weapons available at your disposal  the different kinds of demons who some weapons wouldn't work on and the unique boss battles made the gameplay top notch.  The only complaint was the inability to lock onto a single enemy in a large group of enemies   Besides that issue, the gameplay was fantastic.  9/10Entertainment:  The game was fun, no doubt about it.  It was not the funnest game I have ever played and there were some rage moments, but the game was extremely fun.  9/10Replay Value:  This depends on the kind of person you are.  The game only has 1 story and that is it.  If you play the game through once, you have seen all there is to see story wise.  For hardcore gamers who like challenges, besides easy medium and hard, there is also 4 other modes you unlock each time you beat the previous mode.  For gamers who love challenges and play games for challenges, replay value is all of this game.  For gamers like me, this game is only worth 1 playthrough ever.  Although the game was fun to play, I would not want to play it a second time anytime soon.  5/10Verdict:  This game is an absolute must play for most gamers, but it is not an absolute buy for most gamers either.  Total rating 7.8/10Suggested price:  Pay only $30 for this game or only rent but do not pay $60 dollars for game that isn't close to perfect.",jpage94

($14.99 on Steam) I figured that like its predecessor, this game was about the multiplayer, so I only played the first missions of the campaign (I don't think much of them) and afterward joined a server. Upon doing so, I noticed something within the first few seconds of playing. The sandbox-y feeling that I enjoyed so much back in Battlefield 2 was gone. Now, these much smaller firefight maps that felt cramped and linear have taken over and the huge maps that I loved had vanished completely. EA changed what made Battlefield ... Battlefield, and instead replaced many of those things with elements heavily inspired by games like Call of Duty. This came as a major disappointment to me, but I guess it isn't entirely bad. What they took from the other games, they built upon it and made it better. The destructible environments are fantastic, the fast-paced action is great, and even though the maps are much smaller, you are still given vehicles to travel around in. These elements makes the game-play more varied than the other generic shooters out on the market. Overall, it's good. Perhaps not worth every penny, but definitely worth picking up if you're into the Modern Warfare branch of the Call of Duty series, and would like to try something a little different. As for the hardcore Battlefield 2 / 2142 fans, if you love what the earlier Battlefield games had to offer, then hold onto that copy and save your cash. You're not going to find much of it left in Bad Company 2. -- Afterthoughts: The graphics are great. The game runs smoothly on my relatively cheap computer.

The sound effects and music is also good, although I did prefer the Leonard Nimoy voice overs in Civilization IV than the voice overs in Civilization V. Some of the gameplay mechanic changes have drastically altered the tactical aspects of the game. Having only one unit on a tile encourages more tactical unit placement rather than just mass unit rushes like you can do in Civilization IV. The capture mechanics of cities is also better with cities having a health rating.

The other is the difficulty spread which feels very uneven at times. I found myself being stuck on certain bosses for hours at a time and then breezing through other portions of the game with hardly a death to speak of.

Do this because even with tyre simulation on the AI doesn't have it. Race 40% or longer and the AI not pitting problem is gone, have 4 flashbacks for possible tyre punctures. Now to the actual review - ill simplify it. Great overall experience. Having a 1 hour race come to a conclusion of whether or not you overtake your opponent on the last lap for 1st creates the best pressure Ive experienced in a racing game. You start on one of the lower teams in the first season and every season the cars gets better. Time trial mode is perfect with all cars/track available from the beginning and strictly enforcing corner cutting for invalid laps. Leader boards allow comparison of time against friends or the world. Multiplayer like every other racing game is really only good with friends, random people do random things like driving into walls or you as fast as they can. Car handling is excellent - it will take some practice to get a curve perfect and a lot of practice to get a lap perfect. You can tell a difference between the settings and if your set up is not correct or close to it the AI will beat you so get your setup correct in practice/qualifying. Ferrari is faster then virgin as they should be. The AI will pass you if they are faster, but blocking is possible. Mods are already being released. I suggest the lighting mod to get rid of Codemasters normal yellow/grey tint. Camera mods have been released to improve the **** view, though i prefer the top of the head camera. Also i suggest you use manual and all assists off.

The game doesn't aspire to do anything outside of its core appeal, so I recognize it's not going to be for everyone.  If I had to compare it to another game, it actually makes me think of Donkey Kong '94 for the Game Boy.  It was a pseudo remake of the Donkey Kong Arcade game that then led into some 90 odd puzzle rooms where Mario had to grab a key and get it over to a locked door to progress.  It holds up surprisingly well and the mentality of 'what can we do with these basic mechanics' carries over to Captain Toad.  Because it is sticking to such a simple premise, you can really see how much work goes on behind the scenes to make simplicity satisfying.  Introduction of new mechanics occurs naturally and intuitively.  Difficulty is well managed and reflects the stakes of each level.  No part of the buffalo is wasted with this game, it's just perfect.I'm really happy this game got made and I'm really happy it made its way now to 3 consoles.

Try not to compare Human Revolution to the original Deus Ex too much. Why? Because the more you're going to do it, the less you're going to enjoy it. Human Revolution has some similarities to the original, where original still prevails, but it also has many differences, and it's mostly those differences that make it an outstanding and somewhat innovative game. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a prequel to the original Deus Ex. It takes place in the year 2027, when human augmentations were still only at their early stages and as a result were subject to a lot of controversy. You play as Adam Jensen, a manager of security at Sarif Industries, one of the leading augmentation tech companies. However, after a surprise attack by secret ops on the facility, Adam was left mortally injured. As a result he got augmented and now 6 months later is ready to uncover the truth behind the attack. The storyline of the game is fairly good, although it is not its strongest point. There are interesting twists and turns along the way of course, and most of the major characters are very well-developed, but I think it's mostly the gameplay that makes this game. Just as with the previous games in the series, DX:HR is about analysing the combat situations and having freedom to approach them in multiple different ways. You can go guns blazing if you wish, or you can sneak in. You can hack to learn the door code, you can utilise your superior social skills, or you can simply find an alternate way in. You get the idea. The augmentation system is slightly different to previous Deus Ex games since you can upgrade them both via special praxis kits AND through gaining experience. The other thing is that if you played through all the side quests and explored, you can by the end of the game pretty much acquire all of the augmentations and enhancements, whilst in the original that was not quite the case. So it's all a matter of prioritising which you wish to get early on and which later. Some new features that really make DX:HR shine that the original didn't have are 1) the takedowns - knock out or kill your target in a special way by coming right up close to him/her; 2) the cover system - instead of just shooting mindlessly, you really need to be taking cover a lot or else you will die too easily; the good thing about it is that the cover system in this game is very flexible and dynamic - you can take cover pretty much behind anything, and you can move between different covers very easily; 3) the hacking mini-game - every time you hack into a computer or a door console, you will have to play a very fun, yet challenging at times, mini-game. DX:HR has a somewhat of unique graphics. The colour palette is mostly in the yellow and golden colours. Personally I am not too fond of it, because I hoped to see some more colour variation in the game, but this ""yellowness"" is not too bad and you get used to it. The in-game music is very impressive and the voice acting is great too. The dialogues are very well-written and a lot of the time you get to choose what to say, what adds variation and a great degree of role-play, allowing you to mold Jensen's personality into what you want him to be.  Finally I'll mention that just as with previous Deus Ex games, you get multiple endings, and those raise some really interesting philosophical issues, which is a sweet way to end a great game. I'll highly advise you to check out each of the endings. Overall a fantastic game. Although in many ways the original is still better, DX:HR offers a lot of new stuff, what makes it a worthy rival to the original game, and overall puts it well above majority of the games out there.",Matseb2611

Controls are very fluid and smooth with a keyboard/mouse. Some people hate QTEs, so if you hate 'em, too bad. This game has them. I think they're a perfectly fine gameplay mechanic. I don't mind.Combat is, like the controls, fluid and smooth. I'm shocked, considering Crystal Dynamics has largely made...well...games far inferior to this in the past. :/Very cinematic gameplay that is a mixture of Uncharted/Assassin's Creed. The optional ""Tombs"" have, so far, been relatively easy. I was always a fan of the Tomb Raider stories/lore, but never a fan of the puzzle-based gameplay in the previous games, and while there's some small element of puzzles in the main game, it's definitely more of an action/adventure than an environment puzzle. Which I think is great.The story, and character evolution of Laura, so far, has also been great. It's audacious to say this only three hours in, but I can already see this being in the conversation for end-of-year awards when November/December rolls around.Just fantastic presentation, solidly smooth gameplay, and far more likable Laura now that she isn't wearing hotpants with Double D cups. I'll hold off on a 10 until I actually finish. ;D About the only thing I can think of at this point that would make me lower my score later is if they end it on a cliffhanger.",revial

So Sleeping Dogs does the same, only better than many similar games.  The one thing that really stands out if the combat, lots of options and fighting reminds me of an old style beat up game in terms of just being great fun.  Personally, for me it is the sand box approach and multi path character development options that really add up to a great experience backed up by the free HD texture pack.  It actually feels like a new game because of these.  I heard early patch revisions had a pretty crap options menu, that is certainly not the case in 1.5.  Looks and feels good all round.  Personally, I thought many of the other games out there felt very limited graphically but this looks a generation ahead and the gameplay feels like a step forward too.

So I started Left 4 Dead 2 with very high hopes. And I haven’t been disappointed. Valve have improved almost everything. We have 4 new survivors and the location has been moved to the deep south. The campaigns are considerably longer due to larger maps. More challenging tasks have been introduced and the zombies come thicker and faster than ever. There are several new “specials” to deal with, along with some new weapons, including melee weapons ranging from cricket bats to machetes. L4D2 looks even better than the original and there are some great in-game events: the use of weather as a hindrance to your progress in the Heavy Rain campaign is particularly inspired. It’s also a good deal more difficult than the original. So, pretty much everything about L4D2 is superior to L4D1. Except for the survivors. For me they lack the character of the original team, and although Valve have lived up to their deserved reputation for the quality of the dialogue I just don’t find them as engaging as the original 4. The chat between the survivors in L4D1 is full of great one-liners which helped build the bond with the player, even though you know they’re just bots. Obviously this hardly matters when playing with other people but I wish, nonetheless, that the original characters had been carried over from L4D1. Still, L4D2 is a great game. Play it. Now!",sft

This is annoying for two reasons: 1.)  Blockades ala Fallout 3 prevent you from shortcutting.  Mountains will block your progress at every turn.  2.)  Anticipate a lot of boring walking and getting dead-ended by cliffs.Two other gripes.  The writing is well below Morrowind and Oblivion.  Oddly the books you will find are 10 times bigger...of 10x poorer writing.  The voice acting is all over the place, and most of the characters talk in a very slow, ponderous style.  It takes forever to get through these character's monologues....just to discover you have to trek all the way to the other side of skyrim to progress in the quest.  The characters say almost nothing of interest.  For instance asking the Greybeards about the dragonborn, results in an almost 3 minute monologue that ends with, ""we don't really know why some are dragonborn, but they come in a time of need.""  Wow thanks!  That was rewarding!The speech options are weird.  Over half of them are sarcastic and off-putting.  You can either ask questions, or give d-bag responses.  Really messes with the atmosphere of the game.Game looks like a million bucks.  Questing is harder than Oblivion and Morrowind, in that they are harder to stumble upon.  NPC's will talk your ear off...with no pay off.  While I like the fact the books have been expanded...the writing is very poor.  Quests essentially work like this:  Go to place that is furthest possible from quest giver.  After completing some minor task, trek all the way to the furthest possible place from that point in the quest.  Complete some minor task.   It just seems like they are stretching the play hours.The game looks and runs great.  It's not Oblivion or Morrowind.  This may be good or bad depending on how you like these games.  Expect to get your ear talked off about a lot of unimportant information.  Expect to criss-cross the map for quests designed to lengthen the game experience.

The only really new thing is the art style that borderlands utilizes, it's very unique and gives a nice look and feel to the game.This game wasn't originally made for the PC-market, but it was ported. However it's a fairly decent port, some of the controls are objectionable, there are a couple of instances where you have to use your arrow keys to navigate through menus, something PC-gamers aren't very fond off. But in general it's no problems at all.The biggest problem with the fact that the game is ported, have to do with the game's difficulty.A direct effect of putting a console FPS game on a PC is that the game becomes ridiculously easy.The fact that the AI is incredibly dumb isn't making this less of a problem. The bots will continuously try to shoot you through objects, such as houses and metal walls. Some bosses I was able to take down by simply standing still, the final boss for instance.The class system is not very unique, not new in any way, shape or form. It saddens me that such potential got lost here. It doesn't really feel as if the classes make any particular difference whatsoever. Now one might argue that the ability to specialise(see spec), can counter weight this but in truth it doesn't. The classes is just a mare smoke and mirrors, there's nothing really special about the classes, maybe except for the soldier.The creeps look virtually identical throughout the entire game. You never get to see anything new.The same goes for weapons, there are pretty much 7 different kinds of weapons to chose from in the entirety of the game. The only thing being different is the stats, and sometimes the scope. That is artificial diversity as far as I'm concerned.The missions are also very similar, there are a few kinds of mission types(kill X of Y, collect X many Y etc.), but nothing above that. This makes for an extremely repetitive game, with almost no re-playability.On the other hand, there's a lot of good things with the game too. The story line is meagre but still bearable. The huge amount of randomly generated weapons makes looting a whole lot of fun.And to top it off, the networking worked superbly, no fuss at all.My conclusion is that this game is worthwhile playing if you got 2-3 friendly to play with and if you like repetitive games, with virtually no story attached to it.",VonCarlsson

Listen, they've removed the optional challenges (my favourite feature of AC games), ALL collectibles, most side activities like optional assassinations and things like improving your hamlet in AC3 or playing with your fleet in AC4. And they have replaced it with....nothing. I guess people were fed up with collectibles and side activities but when you remove it all and replace it with nothing....it's boring. It really is.ACO is flashy and beautiful and pulls you in for a few hours but then you'll realize you're doing just two things all over again - side quests and looting lairs (animal nests, forts, villas etc.) Over and over again. There isn't anything else to do. All the interesting set pieces and closed assassination areas like in Syndicate are gone too.Sure there are oodles of side quests but they are usually about ""go to X, talk to Y, kill ABC and bring back the stolen stuff"". Plus the story is not very exciting, the beginnings of the Assassins are kindda humdrum. And the characters are boring too. Bayek is grouchy and uncharismatic and Aya is smart and strong but also about as warm and likeable as a granite block. The villains are just one big grey blob and the villain alpha dog looks like a beta neckbeard. There's nothing quirky or interesting or distinctive in the characters or the writing, it's all just one big, smooth and featureless mass product.I know most people don't like the modern storyline about gods but at least it made the game unique. I've always thought the problem with the things people got fed up with over the 10 or so games - the optional challenges, the collectibles, the side activities, the modern storyline - was not that they were there but that they were half heartedly implemented. In ACO instead of improving them Ubisoft simply took them away.I had a blast in the first 10 hours, then lost all interest. I just rushed the end. I never thought I'll say it but ACO is probably the most boring AC game since the first one, despite the attractive setting and potential for the metastory. Even AC3 was more interesting, at least there was Haytham. In it's boringness and staleness ACO is on par with Revelations. Looking back at it I feel like going back to Black Flag or even Syndicate.

I am a long time gamer since the start of gaming, seen it all. Played a bit of the campaign but mostly on X-box live. Lets start with the graphics that everybody is saying so great. My TV is 53"" 6 year old HD projection (witch weren't that great to start with) so the graphics look like sh** and I have trouble seeing enemies and tanks even close up some times, you have to look for motion for something to stand out. Especially with all the constant smoke and dust obscuring visibility. You shoot an enemy up and a cloud of smoke obstructs further aiming. Not knowing where your enemies are is very realistic but it seems like most of the times you die you never see it coming, sometime the radar will light up enemies when they are shooting at you but allot of times it doesn't which is very frustrating because you can't rely on it. They are trying to take 3D life where you have your 6 senses working 360 degrees and peripheral vision - and then translate it to 2D which doesn't work. They have to give you alternate senses to rely on to replace the ones lost. Allot of times it ends up being just a free fraul off killing and deaths unless you are on a drastically winning team or are on a private chat with 3 other friends to coordinate attacks and expose enemies by sacrificing your own. The ability to respawn on your own personal and bases makes dying only a minor inconvenience adding to the free fraul. In conquest respawning only at home base would solve this plus being made to take bases in order and the game ending when you posses all the bases would eliminate the craziness and late game home base blood baths creating a straight forward goal based battle. The next biggest frustration with the game is getting stuck on you surroundings either waking or driving. When walking anything over 6 inches tall (step height) stops you dead forcing you to jump as well as hills you think you should be able to climb up stop you and you sit there jumping like an idiot trying to get up. You will end up pulling your hair out because of this. When driving a tank you get stuck on almost everything. There is not much that can stop a tank in real life but when you get stuck on a wooden fence or building it's frustrating. Some things come down easy an others do not - very frustrating You should be able to flatten the grass/bamboo/tin huts in the Vietnam version without even slowing down. Some will break with effort but by then you are dead from enemy fire that you can't locate it's origin . Next is the weapons capabilities, as you build rand they give you more weapons not necessarily better ones. As you scroll thought the list of weapons you can't compare them directly, you find two you like at opposite ends of the list and by the time you scroll from one to the other you can't hardly remember where the bar was - to solve this give the power / accuracy / range bars a numerical value. As well the ability to only use one spec in each of the three spec columns is a piss off. You put hundreds of hours into the game to earn this stuff and only get to use 3. They make you choose between armor or ammo, targeting systems or speedy reloading ect............................It feels like all the time and progress is futile. You should be able to use them all, you put the time in you reap the benefits. If it gives you to much of an advantage make them harder to get or set up games where your entrance depends on ability. Low rank players play with other low rankers ect... Another thing that is frustrating is the aiming ability, whenever you hit the button it seems like I am always pointing at the enemies feet. If you set the sensitivity low it moves to slow and you end up dead, too fast and you over shoot the target every time, I can't seem to find a happy middle ground. Always liked some sort of mild auto aiming. Lastly the gun sights projected out in front of you whether walking or driving are either white or lighted red or blue. The white being the worst, you have a hard time seeing them especially when going though like back ground colours or smoke. Half the time you can't tell where you are aiming. The 4x red dot scope is a great spec but you have to pass up other good specs to use it. I should have waited for version 3. I hope they address all the problems with #2 and fire all their testers and hire some that know what they are doing and have some balls to say that the game isn't ready yet!â",FordManiac76

And worse they will kill each other if there are too many friendly fire among them and turn on you in the middle of combat3. Anti-climax lame story - because of bad AI, big event in the game is like nothing happen to NPCs, right after the big event happen, they continue their program as usual. the story is also not worth to mention, no story to tell actually, just missions to do and these missions is not important as the whole. You can play without doing it anyway, so why bother?4. boring maps- The maps of caves, ruins and oblivion plane are repetitive, after few times playing you will see the very same thing over and over5. game breaking items and skill- Although the leveling system is broken you may carefully create a character that is in ""god-mode"" as soon as you have certain items and make your own spells. 120% invisibility, go figure out what is that?6. boring quests- all quests are boring and lost, A told you to go to B, b told to go to C, doing D or get E then return. Almost all quests are like this. These quests are lame and stupid. You become an errant boy/girl for someone. The background story of quests are also lame and not important.7. user interface is bad - everything are in tabs, tabs within tabs8. you can eat anything as long as you don't know the second effect could kill you, that is chemistry.9. you will end up using spells in the end even you planned to play as warrior or stealth10. too many to comment, just saying this game is BROKEN",Qis

I really enjoyed the battle system and the music especially.  The art direction is excellent too, every locale is unique and flavorful.  They are the icing on this cake.However, there were a few dry spots in this cake that prevented it from being a game that really sticks with me.  My main issues lie with the game's overall pacing.  At first you're finding new bosses and new side quests by the dozens.  After fighting so many bosses and doing so many side quests, I came to dread seeing those blue exclamation marks as my sense of duty propelled me onward.  Some of those boss fights can drag on for what seems an eternity.  They can for quite a long time, but don't really change their overall pattern until they're HP critical and then proceed to KO your entire team forcing you to start anew.  An incredible frustration.  Due to in game circumstances, you'll have to fight many of these bosses a second time, though the stories reasoning for doing this is really quite interesting and a part of the stories great plot twist.My second issues lie with the generic dungeon set up.  There's nothing to make them stand apart once you've gone through the game's many traps.Overall though, this game won my heart through it's excellent battle system, it's infectious music, and an overall strong structure.  I would readily recommend it, just beware of the end.  If you're not a fan of rehashing a few bosses and the occasional tedious pacing, you may need to steer clear.",rhaynes7

Equipment, hair, earrings, pretty much anything that would have physics when people move does. The sounds and animations are incredibly varied and smooth on every character, and mechanical parts move in an incredibly realistic way.That being said the game is still in it's infancy stage of release. So the content, while they claim to be expanding soon, is pretty bare right now- even if all of the characters are varied and super fun to play.There are some minor balance issues and matchmaker will probably see some improvements over time.All in all, while resembling TF2 in a few ways (Route 66 map, the game mode types...) it's variety of enjoyable heroes, level of polish, price point with loads of free content promised over this summer, and the Blizzard IP behind it- Overwatch will only gain traction from here on out.",worksa7

There is no strategy involved. You come in when they tell you, (unless you specifically ask to come in earlier while racing) and the pit stop is shown from drivers perspective, so you don't get to see the pit crew at work. Finally, unless I'm mistaken, it shows the crew fueling up the car during stops. This wouldn't be a problem if refueling wasn't banned by the FIA. In reality, the crews are not allowed to add any fuel to the car after the start of the race. All that said, I believe this is one of the best racing games ever created, and will be held as the standard for Formula 1 games in the future.

So many small details that add atmosphere, and you're always discovering new details as you play on (e.g. Link sweatingPositive- The graphics is somehow one of the most beautiful and ugly graphics (see below) I've ever seen. The graphics generate an amazing atmosphere, and the art style is really distinctive and definitely recognizable.- The level of detail is absolutely astonishing. So many small details that add atmosphere, and you're always discovering new details as you play on (e.g. Link sweating while climbing a mountain, or him shivering in the menu animation when you're in a cold area).- I really liked how many small puzzles can be found throughout the world. Most of the times, if you come across something that strikes you as a little ""odd"", you will most likely have found another one of the what feels like millions of mini puzzles.- If you love exploring an open world, this game will get you hooked instantly. The world is...incredibly vast. I think I have never seen an open world that big.- Summed up: This is one of those games I played for a few hours straight without actually having done anything. Which is something amazing to accomplish.Neutral- It's an open world game alright. This comes with all the benefits and problems open world games have. Although the world is vast and beautiful, it also just feels empty at times. Additionally, you will do a lot of typical ""open world quests"", i.e. climbing towers, collecting materials etc.- For me, the world didn't really feel alive. There are some NPCs you come across that react very naturally to you, but there are also, as mentioned above, so many empty spots in the world.- The story is...a typical Zelda story. I like it, but I can see a lot of people that might not know Zelda feeling a little disappointed throughout the game (it's very generic).Negative- The framerate is awful. We're not talking ""stable 30 fps with a few dips"". I think it's important that you are fully aware that the Wii U version feels more like a ""average 15 fps"" game. At no point did the game actually run smoothly, and basically any sudden change in camera angle (e.g. if you fall into water and look down) will have a frame dip.I know there are a lot of people that aren't bothered that much by bad framerates, but for me Breath of the Wild is borderline ""unplayable"".- Controls are, because of the framerate issues mentioned above, very unreliable and feel sluggish at best.- The sound design is very disappointing. The music is very minimalistic, and the sound effects, although ""100 % Zelda"", do not really feel fitting.- I'm absolutely not a fan of the ""breakable weapon"" concept. It doesn't really add anything in terms of actual depth of gameplay, but rather forces you to always make sure to have a good stock of weapons.- The menus are very, very micromanagement heavy. Crafting is possible and encouraged, but feels very bare bone. Creating food is a tedious process of selecting the ingredients you want to use, exiting the menu, throwing them into a pot, wait a few seconds, and then get one food item out of it.RecommendationLet's be honest: If you grew up with Zelda games (like me), you will buy this game anyway. Still, I'm convinced that this game, would it not have been a Zelda game, would not have gotten anything else than mediocre scores. As breathtaking as the open world and level of detail is, the overall performance is horrible, and yet I still keep coming back to play this game.",dreamstate42

With a emotion driven single player, an amazing game engine, a beautiful original score, and an addictive multiplayer, Battlefield 1 is the game FPS fans have been asking for. The single player campaign or, ""War Stories"", is so emotional from the open prologue mission to the very last story, that it kept me engaged and gave me goosebumps throughout each of the missions. With the cutscenes throughout the missions, it was like watching a movie, the motion capture was so realistic, it even had me fooled on knowing the difference between a video game and real life. Each character felt human and you could feel the raw emotion that they were expressing throughout the critical moments in the missions. The multiplayer as I said is addictive and hard to take your eyes off of, it is so amazing, the most satisfying part is the destruction which is amped up to max with improved detail. The new game mode, ""Operations"", is the showcase game mode in multiplayer where both sides fight to capture sectors of map until capture each control point, and of course all the original game mode are back in all their glory like, ""Rush"", and ""Conquest"", and now their is, ""Team DM"", ""Domination"", and a another new game mode, ""War Pigeons"". The arsenal of weapons at your disposal is big, really big, there is a lot to choose from, from the normal standard issue weapons that most known to in service in the war, to the exotic weapons that make every side evenly powered. This is a WWI game based on WWI, it is a historical game but it is more inspired by it than being a historically accurate game, but it is nonetheless a great tribute to all those who served in WWI. For someone like me who is a big Halo, and Call of Duty fan, I have suddenly became a huge fan of Battlefield 1 and the series, I really prefer this game over Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Like most people, we were hoping that Call of Duty would go back in time rather than going forward in time, but no one expected Battlefield to take the route, but they have amazed me more than Bad Company 2 amazed me when I first played it. To me Battlefield 1 is the best FPS game of 2016, and one the most memorable games I have ever played, and I will be playing it for years to come, but to sum this game up in one word, Unbelievable.",Th3GreenHorne7

This game is a nice surprise for anybody looking for something fresh and easy to play. Bastion is an action RPG with some innovative points. The most important is the voice of a narrator telling the story as you advance in the game. It is a great tool that invites to keep playing in order to find out new details about the Kid and the Calamity. The game is structured in different areas that are dynamically built as the player moves. They are generally short, so they are perfect if you just want to play for a while after a hard day of work. As a consequence, Bastion is not very long (it took me 8 hours), but in my opinion it has the right length for its prize. There is a wide range of weapons available. They are given to the player as new areas are finished, and allow for different combat styles (ranged, melee or a combination of both). There is also a counter system in order to give back some damage if the corresponding key is pressed at the precise moment.I think Bastion will be specially enjoyed by all those who played 2D action RPGs during the 16-bit console generation.

The action is shoddy with fighting being a hit-and-miss affair where headshots are just pure luck, rather than the reward for a good aim. The small inventory and the incessant backtracking just made the game a chore for me to play, and the less said about the so-called puzzles the better. Overall, as you can probably tell, I did not enjoy the time I spent on this game.I liked the graphical update, even though the cutscenes seem out of place as clearly less could be done to improve them for the HD era, but thats about it.After the pinnacle of the series that is Resi 4, stepping back into the Spencer mansion has had no appeal for me. Not only that but doing so has made me misty-eyed for the days I remembered this game as a masterpiece.Have I been spoiled by more modern games with their shiny visuals, instant gratification and drip-fed rewards?

In fact, considering the alternative (I am thinking about how I miss mass effect 1 dispite the graphics improvements in 2 and 3 that sucked)- I wish that every good or decent game had another go like in fallout new vegas, where the graphic is changed but everything else is improved. You probably already heard of the hardcore mod- but this game have so much more. Right- Puting a faction clothes doesn't feel like hitman, sneaking with a silencer pistol and hacking computers isn't like splintercell (Through the minigame is better) And butchering people at the strip isn't GTA (I admit I didn't try that one), but you have the choise and this is what matter. The reputation-karma system is a giant improvement, this is no longer a fight between good and evil which I hated in fallout 3. The brotherhood of steel is in the gray zone again- not evil and not good, but there are much more factions here- every town has its own opinion of you, every gang, tribe, republic- and its working. The gameplay requires that you skip some missions, because if you want to achieve something beyond money you can't just take every contract you are given (Or maybe you can? I didn't try that one either) The ending is great- There are not only many diffrent ""big"" decisions but you also need to think what are consequnces of you decisions- The NCR give order, but is this what the people of Primm really need? The brotherhood of steel have good people, but won't killing them  now prevent an un-needed blood spilling? Is Mr. house really aiming for better tommorow, or did the power made him a heartless crazy old man? Or maybe things will be better off if I will be the one in control around here? And I admit I don't have the answers to all those questions yet- because I made other decisionsAnother big imporvement is the companions- Not only easier to control with the companion wheel but also much less linear. Talking to them, depending on the conversation, can reveal new side missions that improve loyality and change how the game ends, at least for those pals of yours. Some companions have different traits and some have different behaviour- like Boone, who will engage every Legion man he sees without asking or caring about the consiquences. My review is already getting too long for most people to read- so I will sum up and say this is a good game, much improved fromt he previous fall out 3 and I suggest getting it when the price is right. I don't agree about this game replay value- The game is big time consumer and is simply too long to play again for me. And thats exactly why I had to make my decisions, and live with them.Oh and one more thing, this time is bad- For a game that long, with so much hours in the open, I would much expect a much better and varied music- If this game happens in the 2200+, how come the music is from 1500?

Well guess what, your fancy movies and celebrities dont make up for boring narrative, mindless grinding and cash squeezing at every corner.No gameplay, no feeling, no feelings, no nothing.

What I loved:-Artwork:  The artwork was vibrant and well done.-Maps were well done in terms of the amount of space for fighting.-Dialogue: It was crass, puerile, and a great change from ""I'm Oscar Mike"".  Awesome use of gratuitous foul language.  I enjoyed the jokes as well.-Weapons:  So many great ways to kill people.-Sliding was a blast!-Linear FPS game: I usually prefer linear singleplayer FPS games because USUALLY the story moves better.  Usually.-Act 5:Chapter 3 through Act 7 - Why couldn't most of the game move the plot like this?On the fence:-Difficulty-too easy, but maybe this made the skill shot system more fun?-Surprisingly, I didn't miss the ability to jump.  I would hit my jump button out of reflex but it wasn't horrible without jumping.What I hated:-3 button presses just to get to the main game menu of the game.-GFWL-20 minutes to get into the game.  Not game installation time, just getting GFWL to update properly and get to the main menu.  You see, it appears you can update GFWL in the game, but you have to restart the game.  But there isn't a way to exit the game at this point because you haven't gotten to the main menu.  Then you have to update GFWL extrnally but it doesn't tell you that.  You just have to guess.  Then you can get into the game.  This actually put me in a bad mood just to start Bulletstorm.  Games should really take off the GFWL tag.  they might get more sales.-Horrible, horrible PC controls.  Did anyone play the PC version?  C'mon.  The worst weapon switching ever.  You can equip 3 weapons but 1 button only swaps between TWO of the weapons.  Menu system for buying upgrades/ammo was pretty bad too.-Editing the config files to correct the neutered graphics options and input settings was bad too.  The .ini files are encrypted so a third party program must be downloaded. All to fix settings like max FPS, FOV, mouse smoothing, mouse sensitivity, etc.  The game was unplayable on the lowest sensitivity setting in the GUI.-Quicktime events.  Oh my god, the quicktime events!!!!  Make them stop.-Villain wasn't really a villain.  Ok, so he had the protagonist assassinate innocent people, but it's such a trite motivation for a vendetta that it didn't really feel evil enough to devote 10 years in revenge.  At most, the villain hurt the feelings of the protagonist.   In the Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas had his protagonist, Edmond  Dantes, wrongly thrown in prison for about 13 years.  Now that is motivation for revenge!  -Game never closed properly.  Win7 always popped up with a dialogue asking me to close the program because it stopped working.-Act 1 through Act 5 chapter 3-really kinda bored with the story here.  Too bad this is most of the game.",Lokius

Im sorry your terrible at playing a average difficulty FPS/MMO but the game cant help you there. Snipers are not a real problem, go heavy and thrown on a shield expose them and kill them. Tanks are what they are for power... they cost an ingame currency to buy to keep players from repeatedly spawning tanks to use. If you spawn in the middle of tank fight as a new person, SPAWN ELSEWHERE since it is actually impossible to have a spawn point ONLY in a battle as every team has a ""safe zone"" area so you cant be ""pushed off"" the map. This game is HUGE with thousands of players in a map, if a medic could heal a heavy and keep him alive under fire the game would be incredibly imbalanced. As a medic healing will ALWAYS get you xp if you sustain it to do the other player any good just flashing them a quick heal with your heal gun doesnt help them and hence wont reward you. When I started this game I did spawn into a battle and died a few times but quickly figured most things out. To start my game I went with a heavy player since they have a large clip and a shield to further increase tanking ability. The game is incredibly fun and open, the weapon/armor/vehicles can all be customized with different attachment etc to a depth even better than battlefield. There is a learning curve, it took me probably 3 hours or so to get all of the major gameplay aspects down and I would consider myself an average FPS guy, far from expert. Part of the beauty of a game like this is the sheer numbers required to make big differences in the game, sometimes in a large battle you will get killed with little you can do to prevent it (save hiding) just due to the number of crosshairs pointing back at your large group of soldiers assaulting a particular location. No single player of any skill level can capture a defended zone by himself because the game is so big everything significant will require a sustained effort from many individuals and that makes this game a hell of alot of fun in my opinion.",Compgamer55

Although I should mention that Planetside 2 can be very frustrating to people that can't deal with being out manned or outgunned. Planetside 2 isn't about fairness, but about strengths and weaknesses: classes/vehicles often specialize against a certain type of enemy.  This means that squads of players have to use their different classes to work together in order to fight the various types of enemies. This forces players to have to switch their vehicle/class to meet the situation at hand. Also, because the maps are contentment sized, the disbursement of enemies are never equal and you can find yourself outnumbered 10-1 in one area, but find no enemies in other areas. Fortunately the spawning system makes it easy to re-spawn near by or at another battle on the other side of the continent, making it easy to find a good fight. The best part of the game is the hardcore community of players that play the game like it's a sport. Everything in the game is player fueled, meaning that objectives are created with purpose and a human intelligence behind it.

The game's story is somewhat non-existent, the controls feel a little bit awkward for a gamecube controller (But Retro studios and Nintendo still did the effort and I congratulate them) and the fact that you get to explore the same areas for the 3th or 4th time can be a little frustrating and boring.

So be prepared to rage.* There was cross play between consoles and PC. But apparently that was a ""bug"" and the devs then removed the ability for players to cross play.*It has a cash shop*Grinding is the key part of the game other key part being the cash shopI have played many f2p games over the years. But those games did not try to hide what they were. They knew what type of pay model and gaming model they were. Fornite on the other hand is pure greed. The game itself is focused on the cash shop in order to get better gear and heroes. You cannot get better gear or heroes unless you spend money in the cash shop on loot boxes. You might be asking, do they at least drop good gear in game at a lower rate. No they don't drop better gear. The loot boxes them selves are horribly unbalanced in terms of getting legendary's. Take it from a guy who spent hundreds of dollars on the game and only got one legendary gun. One just one.The game play itself  is fun, in between the bugs and crashes. But after a while you start to understand the game is about pure grinding. Everything in the game needs to be grinded for. Guns,heroes, survivors traps and resources.  The items needed to upgrade and move up are a bit rare and makes the grind even worse. You will rinse and repeat doing the same thing. Gather resources build your fort and defend against waves of zombies. The zombies rarely ever change in terms of looks of design even at higher levels.I cannot recommend this game. It is pure cash grab. All they want is money. They have the nerve to want people to pay for an unfinished game still being developed. Still having resets. But the cash shop is in full working order and takes all kinds of payment methods. For over priced loot boxes that give you 95% commons and uncommons no matter how much you spend. If you cannot spend money in the cash shop. Then good luck at higher lvls with your weak weapons and traps to defend your fort. You will be tickling the zombies and running out of ammo fighting those bullet sponges.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!!! STAY AWAY!!",Krisnick28

Although the technology and the game is all very impressive, there are some surprising shortcomings for such an experienced developer. Rage is without a doubt a good game, even a great game, but it falls short in some areas. The game starts out highly addictive, continuously feeding you with new gadgets, tricks, ammo types, collector cards, guns, and most importantly; stunning environments. The gunplay is in a linear environment but a wide and deep selection of devilish toys at your disposal against very well designed enemies and AI will distract from the fact that the game is hardly ""open world"". id Tech 5 is a very interesting engine compared to others. It seems to host unlimited textural and geometric detail and the environments are more detailed on the XBox 360 than any game I've ever played on my high-end PC (I purchased it for XBox because I didn't want to have to wait for the outrageous install and update times the PC version has) and it all runs at 60 fps on console as opposed to the standard 30 fps. Personally, I would have liked to see some more dynamic lighting and other effects at a framerate of 30 because although the detail is unparalleled, the lighting itself is very bland and boring. Rage doesn't use LOD or model swapping, which completely confuses my conventional wisdom of polygon engines. Despite the amazing tech, the actual visuals are hit or miss. With the engine offering so much more detail, it raises the demand for detail that much more on the artists. Some areas, especially Subway Town, are possibly the most graphically impressive scenes in any video game to date. Other areas (mainly indoors) are bland, colorless, and unimaginative. It's easy to tell which zones had more artistic direction/attention given to them. The game itself is distinctly separated into 2 parts. The first part is, as I've already mentioned, highly addictive as the reward for missions comes in the gain of numerous new and addicting toys to play with. The second half introduces absolutely no game elements, completely abandons all RPG elements except for buying and selling (which also takes a hit as you begin to find so much you don't need to buy or sell). No new enemies are introduced, and the story is quickly rushed to a bland and unimaginative ending. The story is very cliche, but I can't deny the level of atmosphere present in certain moments. This game is all about the shooting, and it works very well. Enemies are very well-designed and unique and have impressive AI, and every type of ammo and every gun (except the sniper rifle which is outdone in every way by the pistol of all things) feels totally unique, and crafting is yet another reason to explore the nooks and crannies of the openly linear world. Racing is disappointing and feels bereft of any skill. The actual races are designed to keep the person who starts in first in first until he wins, and the rally mode is a **** of vehicle nonsense. It's a pretty disappointing multiplayer feature and won't keep me coming back, but the rewards for racing in the campaign are very enticing. Ultimately, Rage is a great game and very well-designed.

I've completed it 3 times now and I can still have a blast playing though it again. The geo-mod engine, although ground-breaking is not implemented all that well in RF. I would have been fun to experiment with it, having scenarios that evolve around destroying buildings or walls to find a path. but the G-mod tech is only really used nicely during the 1st part of the game. after that, the game only starts to fall apart.There is a certain point in the game where you start fighting a new type of enemy, mercs. This is the worst part of the game because mercs are equipped with powerful weapons, most notably the rail driver which can penetrate through walls and cause instant death. and seeing that the AI in RF tend to fire IMMEDIATELY as you enter their view, more than a few frustrating deaths are to be expected.The game's soundtrack is low-budget, but surprisingly ambient, at least during the first half of the game, and the voice acting is ridiculous, but funny (case-in-point ""DIE, CAEPEK!!!""). I find this game to be so bad, it's actually really good! everything from graphics to story points my instincts to say that the games crap, but I have fun playing it regardless of whats wrong with it. so take my opinion for what it's worth. if you are tolerant with games, you'll find a great game.",BlueWorrior

This is why DICE included a partial auto-aim to the console version. This is still a PC title but you will get quite a bit of enjoyment from the console version. BTW, screw EA for forcing DICE to rush this title the way they did. The ""finished"" product was a beta version and now DICE is having to release patches to fix the problems.

I'm a long time fan of both ninja gaiden and the souls series. I'll start with the cons-Cons1. Lack of variety in level design. The levels are dull and visually unimpressive. I can't recall a single moment I was impressed by this. It's not terrible but quite repetitive.2. Story. By the end I didn't feel connected to any of the characters or events. There is little character development and little reason to care about events.3. Difficulty. This may be a plus for some but in this game I really dislike it. It's not tough but fair, it's mostly just tough. The main reason being that although I have a small armory of weapons at my disposal none of them seem to do much damage, particularly against bosses. This makes fights feel long and drawn out. Getting to the end felt like too much of a slog.4. Weapons & Armor. There's way too much of this. I can't sort through all of this crap. It takes forever to figure out what's good. Also the weapons and armor lack any interesting qualities or backstory. I don't have the sense that 'this is the weapon for me'. I just feel like the attack rating is slightly higher.5. Too much rpg, not enough action. Unlike souls the focus isn't on your skill, it's often on your level and attributes. It's important to take time to train and level up. Unfortunately leveling up is a slow process, i was supposed to reach level 145 to tackle the final boss... instead I just farmed for high level gear... the lack of open world design means that in order to level up I'm stuck small levels killing the same enemies over and over again before running to a shrine. It's dull and if I die in the process it's very frustrating, mostly because i'll have to repeat this process over again.6. Lack of open world. I understand this was a design choice but it prohibits the development of a connection with the game and removes any desire to explore.7. Bosses. The bosses lack any real character. They're annoying to fight but ultimately forgettable because the art design is uninspired and there's no real buildup to most of these encounters.8. Enemies. The same enemies are reused throughout the entire game, they just have more hp in later levels. There are a few variations introduced later on but not nearly enough for such a long game.Pros+1. Revenant system. Fighting the computer controlled versions of dead players is a fun idea.2. The combat system. There is a lot of depth when you factor in ki powers, weapon stances and weapon types.Overall this game just isn't that much fun and I couldn't recommend it. It's simply too repetitive and lacking in memorable moments. Pick up dark souls 2 or 3 or bloodborne on ps4 instead. They are better in every conceivable way.",Reed618

It's arguable whether this game would actually be worth $60, but its $15 asking price for an entire universe of sandbox planets to explore that all feel both familiar and unique, seven interesting races with dozens of codex entries that flesh out their background, a full-length campaign that integrates with your exploration to encourage traversing the universe, a crew system that gives unique followers and passive bonuses based on who you recruit, and full mod support for the community to do practically whatever they'd like with all of this... I honestly couldn't ask for much more beyond making the game fully 3D, but No Man's Sky seems to indicate that that may not be such a good idea.Starbound integrates Role-Playing with sandbox and exploration in such a unique way and only has a $15 asking price.

But I decided to give the game a chance anyway. And it was...not bad. I didn't love it as much as the previous games, sure. But most of that was because I liked the characters of the former games more. Dante seems to have been made to appeal to today's ""edgy"" teenagers, and any time I started to grow slightly fond of him he spewed a line that instantly made me hate him again, and just made me miss old Dante's one-liner and not so serious attitude. But oddly enough, he wasn't the character I hated the most (though he's definitely a close second.). Nah, that had to be Kat. She was pretty useless at the start of the game, only being used to get in and out of Limbo, and mostly seemed to be shoved in as a half-hearted love-interest for Dante. The other characters weren't really much to write about either, and I missed it when Mundus was an all-powerful god-like demon. Not just one with a god complex. But enough **** about the characters. The things I did like was Limbo, a lot of the levels were very well designed and very cleverly made. Hell, I actually loved the platform sections! Things I usually despise in my hack-and-slash game. Another thing I loved was the combat, switching between angelic and demonic weapons was fluid and I was able to make some truly epic combos! Unfortunately, it was also rather easy to reach SSS level in style, and to stay on it too. You see, the meter only seems to deplete when you get hit, instead of it draining while you did nothing like in the old games. And if you pay a little attention, you can dodge the hits of most enemies easily. But later on, the combat became a bit annoying. They put two hard-hitting miniboss games together to make combat ""harder"", but not in a fun, challenging way, just...annoying. The boss fights were also pretty fun, but not really all that hard (and I swear that one came straight out of a Futurama episode), except for the last one. The last boss fight...fine, I won't spoil it. But it was damn awesome! As for the plot in general? Well, let's face it. The plot in the older games was always a little vague...This time, the plot is a little clearer! Allthough not all that memorable. And the writing? The dialogue was pretty awful if you asked me, I don't know if it was the voice acting or just the weak writing but the dialogue between Kat and Dante as they walk to the Slu-, erm, Virility factory made me cringe, and all the F-bombs Dante has to drop to seem like a grown man just make me want to punch him in the face... All in all, DmC is not a bad game. And although it doesn't deserve the glowing praise that some Critics give it, it certainly doesn't deserve the 0, 1 and 2 scores it gets on Metacritic either. I'd say it deserves a 7, at least for Limbo, the Combat and some of the Bosses. But the Characters and Writing can definitely use some improvement. (Oh, and PS. The Devil Trigger was SH!T, not only didn't you turn into some crazy angel/demon hybrid. It also lasted way too short.)",Risax

I was expecting a game that would keep me interested and playing for a long time, but instead, I hit max level on several characters, and the only way to progress through Inferno is to purchase items from the Auction Houses.  I like to farm, and was looking forward to farming and upgrading my characters when I max leveled them, but it turns out that this game is not the Diablo I once knew.  This is supposed to be a gear farming game, and for many people (myself included, and I have over 200+ hours in the game) post patch 1.03, getting your own upgrades to drop is almost impossible.  I'm stuck in Act II Inferno, and being a hardcore gamer, I want to progress, but can't because I didn't have the game prior to the patch that nerfed the quality of the gear dropping.  Upgrades in the gold AH are too expensive for me to afford, and I refuse to spend real money in the RMAH, so I'm stuck farming and never getting anything of value, and never progressing.  Not fun at all.  Now I login every couple days to check the gold AH, but don't really play anymore.  Until drops are fixed so that people can actually get their own upgrades without having to use the AHs, this game is broken.  Other issues include: always online makes hardcore frustrating (I won't play HC because I don't want to rubberband to my death), multiplayer is limited to four players (and you get punished for playing with friends as they take a cut of your magic find), builds are cookie-cutter or you won't survive in Inferno, almost every class has to kite monsters to survive in Inferno (the exception at the moment being a WW barb, but even they must kite at times, and given Blizzard's track record, expect this build to be nerfed), Blizzard customer service is horribly inattentive and they seem out of touch with their player base, patch 1.03 was a horrible disaster, and the CEO has promised us we'll get more of the same in 1.04.My hopes for this game are all but dried up.  If you loved earlier Diablo games, you probably will suffer the same disappointment I have.  Avoid for now, but don't hold your breath that anything will get better.

It is unique, does justice to the lore (you will understand if you have read the original fiction) and has some great game play systems.  The graphics are sub par with LOTS of annoying clipping, animations are repetitive and lack impact, the questing structure is awful with LOTS OF FETCH QUESTS, limited ability to move about the map that divides open areas into tunnel segments, dialogue is poorly written, voice acting and line delivery variable from acceptable to down right cringe worthy, NPC models are poorly executed and repeat CONSTANTLY.  The uniqueness of the game style and setting, use of great mechanics for crafting and skill building are what carry the game along with the general tone of the story and just the concept that make this worth playing ONCE and only once as long as you can stomach traversing the same map, OVER AND OVER AND OVER again.  My advice is to watch a play through and if you want the story just watch it as The Witcher 2 is a far superior game.TL;DNR: 6: Great ideas, adheres to lore and expresses it well, unique game play and RPG elements with acceptable combat.  Poorly written dialogue, terrible animation and graphics, stiff and stilted line delivery that goes from acceptable to awful.  Only purchase on sale and if you are an RPG hard core player as the fetch quests, poor level design and spending 2/3 of your time crossing a map many, many times makes this game hard to play for long.Technology/engine: 4: Lots of loading screens, frequent bugs, generally sub par.AI: 4: Brain dead enemies with the exception of some boss encounters.Graphics: 4: dated, poorly and inconsistent application, lots of NPC repetition, lots of annoying clipping and generally poor cinematics (except for the opening which is brilliant and one of my favorites).Sound: 5: Functional with issues of source to distance and inconsistent triggering.Soundtrack: 5: Standard with little to say about it.Voice acting: 6: Variable from acceptable to cringe worthy.Crafting: 8: The alchemy system is great and very well executed.Customization: 7: Decent play style customization within skill trees.Gameplay systems: 9: The systems are really well developed with a unique timed combat system, signs (magic), alchemy, NPC interaction and development.  This game is to be commended for this aspect and is one of the best in its development cycle but the other aspects pull it down and make it tiresome.  The quest structure and level design are what really detract here.Controls: 7: Serviceable to well done.Story: 7: It is faithful to the lore and the substance of the story, under the poorly written dialogue and variable voice acting, is really great - its execution is really hit and miss.Multiplayer: N/Ae",Nataraja

Many of these 'reviewers' also only have 1 review which makes me think about that Dragon Age 2 scandal...I know now I wont be buying this game until it has a massively reduced price - while I take very low scoring reviews with a big pinch of salt, I find it impossible to take seriously a review which gives a game a perfect 10/10 especially when there is no detailed explanation why.",Cloven

However, it has disappointingly average bosses. God of War has annoying and inconsistent enemies and enemy levels. Off-screen cheap deaths are abundant. Mindless looking-around puzzles plague the majority of God of War 4’s puzzles. It’s exceedingly time-wasting and repetitive with its overly bulky loot system. The menu system is a piss-poor mess of convolution. The camera is uncomfortably zoomed-in far too much. There are numerous instances of confusing over-automation of character and world actions. The game has intolerably sluggish pacing as a whole. The ending is pathetic and not rewarding to the player. There is a jarring non-existence of a smooth transition from the third God of War to the fourth. God of War suffers from an overuse of derivative unnecessary RPG elements from Skyrim/Breath of the Wild.

Some scenes are just jaw-dropping. The gameplay is also spot on. The controls are responsive (except mousing over keys on keypads), the graphics are sharp, the story is compelling and the characters are interesting. A warning, though: when you first play the game, some things may irritate you, but you will soon see that they make sense. Your inventory size is limited and you often have to leave behind precious things that you KNOW you'll need later. But that makes sense. No matter how much you're enhanced, you're not a pick-up truck. Already, the game makes unrealistic concessions to allow you to tote a bazooka, a sniper rifle, a mini-gun, and crates of ammo through public places without being noticed or even through metallic air ducts without making a sound. You might want to try a Schwarzenegger-like charge through a cluster of enemies, only to find that a single bullet can kill you. Well, shucks. A bullet really CAN kill you. The game forces you to play smarter than the usual shooter. That's a good thing. At first, the hacking just seems arbitrarily frustrating and you might try to avoid it at all costs... until you figure out how it works, and then it becomes fun! The only thing that remains that still frustrates me is that you can't carry more than one of each type of weapon (to sell them). If you have a pistol and you pick up a second pistol, it gets converted to ammo and you're left not with two pistols but one pistol with more ammo. But that's a drop of lameness in a bucket of awesomeness. And yet more awesomeness: you really can play this game many ways. Early decisions have an impact on later events, so you can replay it trying out different approaches and you will see different results. The result is that you'll probably replay it many times, playing the good guy, the bad guy, etc. This might not be a fair comparison, but the nanosuit in Crysis does ""feel"" more powerful than the enhancements in Deus Ex. I wouldn't mind a cross-over where I could play DE using a nanosuit, just to compare. :)",Othrandur

Minecraft is arguably the best value you can get from a game this generation. Minecraft somehow combines the addictive gameplay of Simcity and Resident Evil, not two games that normally go together. You start the game with no weapons or shelter, just a vast landscape consisting of different 'blocks' of materials that you can cut and shape into tools and building supplies. The only other creatures you see on your horizon (the gameworld is reported to be about eight times the size of the earth) are assorted animals such as pigs and cows. In the first few minutes of gameplay, you start to notice the sun moving across the sky, and it occurs to you that it will soon be getting dark. And this is where Minecraft can turn from a simple looking Lego game with cute quacking ducks into something that is about to scare the hell  out of you.As darkness settles, you can see 'things' shuffle along the beach towards you, making growling noises. Arrows start flying at you from skeleton archers. It occurs to you that spending the afternoon and early evening  exploring your world was possibly not the most productive use of your time.  Building a shelter close to where you initially spawned is the first order of business.  And this is where the 'mine' and 'craft' come in.By chopping down a tree with your hands, you can get wood. With wood you can create a workbench to make tools such as an pick, axe or sword. Once you have a pickaxe, you can tackle harder materials like stone or iron by digging into the earth or chipping away at cavern walls. And with these better materials, you can use your workbench to make stronger tools, weapons and armor. By the time the moon comes up on your first night, you won't have time to make an impregnable castle fortress, but at least you should be able to put up four walls and  make a door, windows and roof. In the morning, the monsters that kept you a prisoner in your home at night burn up from the morning's sun, making it safe once again to explore.This when when you'll start to figure out that better materials are buried at deeper levels. And shortly after that, you'll realize that deep in your mine (or anywhere that lacks a light source) the monsters are waiting for you. There is genuine fear of being killed, because if you are it means you drop all of items you were holding, carrying or wearing at that spot, and you re-start at your initial spawn point that could be miles away, assuming you can even remember where that was.Minecraft offers addictive gameplay mixed with creativity. Later, as you progress through the game (there aren't any 'levels', you just craft better weapons and items) you can aid your exploring by making boats, a compass that always points toy your spawn area, a watch (so you know if it's dark when you emerge from your mine), even to a minecart rail system! With a strong sword and good armor, you're now able to defend yourself from *most* monsters (called MOBS), allowing you to focus on building whatever you want. I recommend you check out a few Youtube videos of what people with time and imagination can come up with. For really large projects, such as a life-size USS Enterprise... this is where the multiplayer aspect of the game really shines.Together, a group on a server can build entire cities. Players can download or create their own player skins to maintain a bit of style while swinging that diamond pick-axe to bore through tunnels that run under the ocean. Servers can chose to offer players any materials they need to aid in the construction. Again, check online to see just what is possible! Online games also allow you to build without fear of Mobs, which at that point really turns the game into a sim builder.The game also features different climates, so you might spend one day on a sunny beach, and the next hiking across a mountain through the snow. You can explore (and create) lava pools, waterfalls, and occasionally you'll stumble across dungeons. These have chests with loot in them, and a spawn cage that creates the Mobs (there's seven different ones, but I've chosen not to mention one in particular that will eventually give you nightmares). Using torches that you create from wood sticks and coal (of course) keep you from being in the dark underground, and if you surround a Mob spawn cage with torchlight, it will remain safely dormant.Expect to lose yourself in this game for many, many hours. Minecraft (still in beta) is currently about $15, so get in while it's still half price. Beta simply means it's still under development, so items are constantly being added. Great value indeed!",Rainier

While the game does provide you bonuses for participating in these holy wars, the game doesn't revolve around them. If you try and only focus on crusades, wars to expand your empire, or waging war out of boredom (Not like you would get THAT bored of the game), then you would find that your coffers would run dry and your domain would be ripping itself apart limb from limb. The game is more-so about survival than world domination. Probably the most challenging thing about CKII is figuring out how to start (At least if your new the the franchise, like me.) While the game does provide many interactive tutorials for beginners, I find that I lost interest quickly when it came to tutorials. The most critical thing that you should pay attention to if you are new to CK is the GUI and options given to you when it comes to unit management and diplomacy. Once you get past the tutorials and learn how to control your domain its very easy to get started. When you first boot up your very first game and encounter the ruler domain select screen, you will see one of the many   game's strengths- kingdom verity. You can play as any region going as far west as the Iberian peninsula and Iceland and as far east as Persia and Mesopotamia. You can choose to play as a count, duke, king, or emperor. The latter controls all the lesser. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Counties are flexible when it comes to technological and economic growth, but lack a major military force and will have to rely on ""big brother"" for protection. Duchies Enjoy a better degree of autonomy than counties, but are still overshadowed  by kingdoms and empires. Controlling a kingdom is the base experience of CK. You control a large group of domains and have a sizable military force, but you have to manage your vassals to prevent both minor and catastrophic civil wars. You also need to have a good relationship with the papacy or caliphate if you want a good general opinion of your ruler. Many newer players might want to control Empires since they control the most amount of land compared to other ranks of land claims and they control, for lack of better words, a massive, massive amount of military units. However, you will also have many more vassals to deal with and more civil wars to fight. I highly recommend playing as A king before an Emperor.I find with modern games that the more time you spend on it, the more visible the flaws are. This game totally deifies this law. The more and more time you sink your teeth into this masterpiece, the you'll find this game more deep and positively complex than the day you started this game.

This game was a solid 9 or 10 to me UNTIL A BUG RUINED THE EXPERIENCE FOR ME. When transforming from mech to ship there is a bug that will make any grappling, shooting, or attacking impossible so all you can do is move helplessly around the map waiting for something to kill you. This means you have to start all the way at the beginning of the season, losing any upgrades and scrap you've accumulated. To add some salt on this the salesman, Crash, decided to cash in all my Crash Coins before the level, meaning I lost about 3000 scrap, and a good array of upgrades that made my ship pretty unstoppable. I still like the game well enough, but if you are going to make a game be rouge like and punishable you need to make sure these bugs are smoothed out or it will make the game seem unfair and frustrating",diggityd2713

I find all the variations rather exciting. I have played a lot of race car games, and I have to say I like this more than most. It has a great balance of arcade and realism, and a large variety of unique challenges on each track and in each car. The people complaining so much don't really seem to have any good reason to do so. The graphics are beautiful, and they look great no matter what settings you use, so you can play in on a crappy Intel HD3000 or on whatever latest $500 Nvidia monster you have. I find the user interface to be very nice, easy to use, and quick to load. There is a very large amount of tracks and cars to mess around with, more so than in any other race games I can think of, so really, what's the deal? There seems to be plenty of challenge to it, but it's more accessible than the first GRID. The destruction on the cars is brilliant looking, full of realistic mechanics, and plenty of sparks and car pieces flying off, and coming unhinged. The cars look just the way they do in real life, maybe a bit more shine, but still realistic. The range of cars is nice. American cars, Italian cars, British cars, Japanese cars, German cars. You have everything from souped up street cars to full on super cars. The feel of the racing is very intense and visceral and exciting. Each of the cars has its own realistic sounds. I just don't get it. This is a fun game, and it is packed full of content to explore and skills and challenges to overcome. Maybe it's not pretentious enough, maybe it's too accessible. People liked having a game like the original GRID. A game that everyone sucked at it unless you put 50 hours into it, so all the people with jobs stayed away, and only the ultra nerdy, living at home with mom nerds, that could put in the time were any good at it, and they felt better than everyone.

I find there is literally no point playing this game with other people, unless its in a squad with real life friends, even then if your teammates are bad it just makes it harder for you to get a kill.2. Monster vs Monster fighting is cool the first time but having to go through it every single fight just gets annoying. The number of times I'll be fighting one monster in a cave and all of a sudden this giant flying dragon, in a buggy manner starts spamming moves into this confined space and there is literally no room to move.... yeh so cool...3. Why the hell does the map need a lock on feature, can't i just aim the damn pointer and click where I want the way point without some stupid thing locking onto whatever is closest.4.  Flying monsters change locations too often. This coupled with the fact that your scout flies will lose track of your chosen target every time you come across another small or large monster and re selecting  the monster just seems to do nothing until you run away from your current foes.5. The targeting system is actually useless, I have started playing without using it at all. The random locking on to a target through walls when you do use it is actually laughable6.  Fighting giant, flying (or even non flying) monsters in small, cramped locations with them spamming their moves over and over is simply not fun at all.7. The weapon and armour sets/skills just seem very boring and uninspiring maybe this is due to my inexperience but I have progressed into high rank simply using bone armour and a bone charge shield.I really just don't see this game lasting much longer than a couple weeks as a popular game on Twitch and I believe it will pretty much die out soon with only hard core fans continuing to play. I am disappointed by this as i hoped they could have made this game into something much bigger, better and long lasting. I know it doesn't follow the traditional MH formula but why couldn't they streamline the multiplayer aspect, making it easier to find people to play with and having more incentive to actually play multiplayer. Adding in DPS meters or such to promote competitiveness, having some form of ranking based on skill not just how much you've played, Much more variety in possible gear builds.

Overall it seems like there were good intentions going forward but they didnt pan out and now it is filled with a lot of padded content that leaves the good stuff in between hardly worthwhile.",PappyBakesCakes

283707,Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent,PC,3,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        As the others have said, the game for PC is extremely buggy, because it's a horrible port from Xbox. From my experience of playing it (since I'm a pretty big Splinter Cell fan) I've made a list of the bugs/glitches.Some of the ragdolls spaz out so ridiculously that they can actually cause damage to you by slapping you with one of their limbs. The safe-cracking controls are too sensitive and take pure luck to get it right. The Kinsasha missions have their brightness really screwed up (it's too damn bright), as well as giving you two loading screens when trying to quickload, only to be finished off by having the damn game crash. Sometimes the game crashes even by trying to open the radar! By the way, if you don't have the patch  you don't get the equipment rewards (which is  considering it gets difficult to bypass the later hacks) but even then some of the things don't work like the electronic lockpick. If your system is slow and old, some of the cutscenes will repeat over and over like the bomb on the cruise ship failing to detonate or the game doesn't even load up because the intro cutscenes keep repeating. Then there's having to wait about 15 seconds in an unskippable cutscene when you finish a game or the training course to get back to the main menu. Some of the video settings are screwed up as you can't even tell if they're properly calibrated. Sometimes you won't even see if the shadows are there, because of the otherwise bastardized HDR effects, which ruins the gameplay when you need to hide in the dark. Pressing Escape is considered a dangerous move in the game, for instance: if you suddenly press ESC as you're trying to access a computer, you'll get a view of pretty much the whole map from an indeterminate location and as you try to press ESC again  it crashes the game. The SC-20k and the Riot Shotgun both reload in the same way as the SC Pistol  well done, developers. Another great glitch is if you decide to blow up the cruise ship and then Enrica decides to let you inside the bomb lab at the end of the game, but that option gets you nowhere as you can't even continue  Sam just freezes in place and you can't move him, leaving only the choice of killing Enrica before seeing her as viable. And here's a goodie for the people who play with HD screens  if you don't have the game set at 800x600 at the ending where you have to disarm the final bomb  you can consider yourself stuck. The ending of the game where the SWAT bust through the windows simply won't play and you'll just be left hanging there like an idiot until you close the process of the game and start it up again. The overall controls just feel like you need some sensitive analogue stick to do it right, because: 1. Sometimes you can't properly get into crawl spaces, 2. You have to use your mouse to navigate on the profiles' ""Medical Info"", ""Activities"" and ""Personal Info"" sections (and the mouse is invisible.) 3. And, the safe-cracking. Then there's dialogue.. Which can sometimes feel VERY awkward. Even Sam delivers some of his lines really strangely.. and so do the NPCs. The sound is quite messed up too as the music is sometimes either really quiet or really loud and the gunshots are really quiet, while Sam's screams and bullet ricochets are louder. Sometimes you can hear the body-picking-up sound repeat twice at the same time. The game seems like an evil little imp that decides when it wants to be more buggy than other times. I once tried to load a game on the Shanghai level and it came up with a box saying ""Please insert a storage device."" (Obviously from the Xbox port.) There's also an annoying part at the start of the Okhotsk level, when you try to sneak to your fallen equipment, Sam will sometimes not grab the ledge when you fall down the cliff and repeatedly die. And besides that, when he falls  an EXCESSIVE amount of blood just splurts out, making it look like he was slaughtered by a giant lawn mower.Overall, it seems like the game is a completely horrid mess. But that mess only surrounds the awesome remains of the Chaos Theory engine which is the gem of the series, in my opinion. There are some different and cool new moves like being able to grab someone by being right behind the corner. I can't really say I hated the JBA HQ missions, since everytime you have different objectives and to see how many and how fast you can do them is quite a fun challenge. The trust system is OK on the more easier difficulties. Because of these positive things, I'm going to be merciful and give the game a rating of 3.I'm pretty sure I'd give it a much higher rating if I played it on the XBox 360 version, but since I didn't know what the Quality Assurance team had on their hands beside that version and a big bottle of Crown Royal... Well... You just put those three together and you get this vomit-covered buggy PC port. Don't bother getting it unless you're prepared to have a headache and getting prescribed on anti-depressants.",OldManCoot

Some maps now has the brighter (bloom) and darker shaded spots here and there all in a small area, or almost everywhere with those super bump mappings and post filterings of sun-glowing foggings (I feel sea sick already), I could barely taget the super fast running bots with all those effects on. Some game settings does not stick after quiting the game to Windows' desktop, needed to set and change them on every start of the game (is this a free demo game?). It also nags me to login online on on every start of the game, can't they just give the option of loading the game into the offline game menu each time? This game told me that my AMD Sempron 3100+ does not met the minimum CPU requirement, why can't they just shut up and ask me if it's been overclocked from 1.8Ghz to 2.16Ghz? And it's performance is at least as good as a 2.8Ghz Pentium IV on all the games released from year 2005 to 2009 even if the CPU isn't overclocked.

Invisible War has incredible graphics - it needs a fast processor and video card to run well and look good. The interface is much easier and quicker to use than the original (thankfully), and the combat is much more in line with a FPS game. The story is deep, long and involving and the level design is magnificent.

Resolver unos puzzles facilísimos con esta IA se convierte en muchos casos en un infierno, sabes cual es el camino pero no puedes llegar.La historia es insustancial, se puede confundir con que tratan de jugar con el misterio y la teoría como hicieron con las anteriores entregas, pero es que no hay por donde cogerla. En cuanto a la relación del chico con Trico, si el juego hubiera sido más largo y completo, el vínculo emocional y todo lo que han intentado enseñarnos habría calado con mas fuerza, pero no ha sido así.La espera no ha merecido la pena, combina lo peor de ICO y SotC.

I ended up spending 5 days in game leveling to the level cap.  Most MMOs i can hit the level cap in no more than 2 days of grinding.

184394,Mortal Kombat X,XboxOne,9,"Hearing the broken bones, skulls and watching the most over the top fatalities done by some of the most iconic characters in gaming history again is an awesome feeling.  Mortal Kombat X is finally here and it looks and plays better than ever.The game starts of by introducing you to the new faction wars mode in which you will be given 5 factions to choose from.  Lin Kuei, Black Dragon,Hearing the broken bones, skulls and watching the most over the top fatalities done by some of the most iconic characters in gaming history again is an awesome feeling.  Mortal Kombat X is finally here and it looks and plays better than ever.The game starts of by introducing you to the new faction wars mode in which you will be given 5 factions to choose from.  Lin Kuei, Black Dragon, Brother Hood of Shadows, Special Forces and White Lotus.  I chose the White Lotus, A secret organization with powerful martial artists formed by Raiden and Shaolin.  Faction wars is an online experience in which everything you, do whether it is in the single player or  multiplayer will earn you faction points, rewards and will improve your leader board position.The first thing you will notice is how beautiful the graphics are.  The fighters themselves look impressive while small touches such as the sweat, blood and the way they move makes the fighting feel real.The varied of levels are done with a lot of care.  Everything around you is moving.  Each of the 13 levels is like a theme of its own such as the Kuatan Jungle and the refugee camp in which you fight as caged refuges helplessly watch.You can use your environments to your advantage such as throwing an innocent person at your opponent or using objects to jump to the other side.  Getting to know each level will give you the advantage.  Mortal Kombat X is filled with content.  The single player includes the story mode, towers, single fight and test your luck mode.Test your luck is one of the most entertaining challenge modes where 1 to 7 of  the countless modifiers can be chosen such as dashing disabled, infinite timer, and lighting strike that will force you to use different strategies to beat your opponent.  This mode is so exciting that I just came back for more because each fight felt differentThe traditional towers are back; however, what I spent most of my time on was the living towers that are divided into 3 sub modes.  Quick towers, is like the classic towers from previous Mortal Kombat games but with extra conditions that improve on the experience.  These conditions are always updated, so each fight might have different conditions than the previous fight.  Daily tower changes every 24 hours and offers new challenges and then there is the premier tower that offers the most challenging fights.  I enjoyed playing the living tower mode because it added tons of reply value.The Krypt mode makes a return.  The more you fight the more koins you earn which allows you to unlock rewards and secrets.When it comes down to the gameplay, Mortal Kombat X does a great job.  I was impressed by how solid and deep the game mechanics are.  You get to choose from 3 variations for each fighter.  Each variation has different abilities and attacks.  This helps in choosing the strategy you prefer depending on your opponent.  For example, choosing Ninjutsu for Scorpion gives him deadly swords that he can use during battle.You will fill up a super meter that is located on the bottom left every time you execute a normal attack or special moves on your opponent.  The better you perform your combination the faster the bar will get filled.  The first bar is the EX bar that allows you to do powerful moves when activated.  Once the super meter is filled the X-ray becomes available.  The X-ray is the strongest and most devastating move in the game.Learning the different techniques during a fight is key because each move counts.  Delaying your character to get up after a knockdown is a useful technique as it confuses your opponents timing.There are also training rooms to do fatality practices and improve your skills.  The controls are easy to pick up to perform all sorts of combinations and fatalities.The story caught me by surprise it was like watching a big block buster that kept me entertained and wanting more the whole time.The story spans 25 years following the last game and it is split into chapters that are filled with fights.  Each chapter focuses on a single character.  For example, chapter 1 focused on Johnny Cage, chapter 2 on Kotal Kahn and so on.It was interesting to see how the story unfolded; you really get to learn more about the characters as you feel each one has a unique personality.  The elders have lost power to Kotal Kahn and it is up to our heroes to take back control.  During the journey, you will come across many characters from previous games and you will also be introduced to new ones as well.The cut scenes are very good with many quick time events that allow you to interact with the game.  The cut scenes were a bit long but I never felt it dragged on as they were entertaining.  I was hoping that the main campaign would be longer as I completed it in only around 5 hours.The roster features 25 old and new characters so far, each of them feels different with their own personalities.  The new characters such as D’Vorah and Erron Black are great but my personal favorite was Ferra/Tor; 2 different characters but fight together during battle.  Ferra is the small warrior who sits on the back of Torr, a beast who shows no mercy.The fatalities are back and more blood and gory than ever.  There is something special about performing a fatality, it just feels satisfying.   There is a new easy fatality feature that allows players to do a fatality much easier.With good soundtracks, and excellent gameplay Mortal Kombat X reminds us of what made the series so captivating in the first place.  Whether you are a veteran or a new comer, Mortal Kombat X will give you a great time.",foxviewchannel

And yes, I do remember specifically thinking about a ""plan of attack"" rather than just being spoon-fed everyIt is so refreshing to play this game after playing Modern Warfare 2. The singleplayer campaign has more replay value (in some of the levels) because they do not give you a completely linear experience and you can play a level over again to completely change your plan of attack. And yes, I do remember specifically thinking about a ""plan of attack"" rather than just being spoon-fed every second of the game. Modern Warfare 2 might as well have been a (horribly bad) movie rather than a game. Bad Company 2 gives me room to think, and in fact, requires it.The singleplayer campaign does, admittedly have a poor story and is way too short like Modern Warfare 2. But the good news is that it doesn't take itself waaaay too seriously like MW2 does, so it is at least a fun ride even though it is still inane garbage. In a way, it openly admits to being garbage and celebrates the fact, rather than being like MW2 -- woefully unaware of its own banality.The graphics are a bit inconsistent, with some really blocky objects strewn around here and there while the character models are extremely detailed and photo-realistic. The gun models are really boring to look at. But the levels in the tropical regions are totally lush and lovable. Engine-wise, it is an amazing-looking game, and yes, if you have DirectX 11 and a processor that can handle it, it looks better than MW2 on the highest graphical settings.The sound is probably the best I have ever heard in a first-person shooter, so I don't have anything else to compare it to except reality. Moving around, handling my gun, shooting, and getting shot at all sound as they would in real life as far as I can tell, except that loud sounds are made quieter (i.e. guns) or given the NIHL effect (i.e. tank fire) so you don't break your eyedrums.The multiplayer is simply the best online shooter available right now. It goes for what I think is just the right balance of fun and realism. It is tactical, it has fairly big maps, it is team-based (you *can* go solo... but you'll die), and there are no killstreaks! Yay! And you actually have to work hard to get promoted, which is a complete change of pace from the made-for-idiots MW2 rank/achievement system. If you can find a server that isn't really laggy (which is a little bit easier now that they've patched it), it can be the most intense mutliplayer experience of your life.Of course, there are two more big shooters coming out soon: Call of Duty: Black Ops and Medal of Honor. Will they unseat this game from its multiplayer throne of near-perfection? Definitely not Black Ops (based on the MP trailer I just saw), and probably not Medal of Honor (I tried the MP beta, which was really great but not this good). I don't think a better online shooter will be made until Battlefield 3, which is a long way off.",WeeBee886

Does playing through the first two games make the wait worth it? I would play through Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 numerous times before playing through Mass Effect 3. I absolutely love the series so far. Here is how Mass Effect felt to me. I hope you enjoy.If I had one word to describe my experience with Commander Shepard it would be wow! From touching the Prothean Beacon on Eden Prime to the final battle with a Saren ""like"" creature. I hate that I am just now finishing it, because I am already on Mass Effect 2. Hopefully, I will get to Mass Effect 3 some time this summer (ha-ha). I have been playing this game since 2009, and due to a couple of ""Red Ring's"" I had to put-off the game for some time.This is probably one of the best stories I have ever experienced in over two decades of gaming. Every planet, mission, and side quest told intricate details to flush out the Mass Effect universe even better. The only reason this game lacks the one point needed for the perfect score would be due to two factors. First, on the side mission planets Commander Shepard drives around an SUV like vehicle called a Mako.  Unlike the shark the vehicle is named after this Mako is clunky and difficult to drive up mountains (which seem to be in abundance in every planet). The clunky mechanics make it difficult for a completion-ist (like myself) to scavenge every single piece of the world looking for loot. I still did this to most worlds, but near the end of the game the story was so amazing I just did the side quest on the planet and stopped looking around for more loot.Loot in Mass Effect comes in the form of weapons, weapon mods, bullet mods, armor, medical mods, medi-gel (used to heal the mako, party members, and even Commander Shepard), and grenades. Fun to collect, but by the time I got near the 45-50 hour mark I rarely found anything better than what I already had. The second reason to hold off the perfect score would be world creation. For three of the headlined side quests (where you help your party members) Commander Shepard finds himself in the same bunker. The same bunker appears in about a half dozen planets, and there are others which get recycled in a couple different areas. For Bioware to make a game this large in 2007 means sacrifices like this probably had to be made. I finished it in 2012 where bunkers (dungeons) can be artificially built by AI. I would not say the combat is bad, though I would not say it was great either. Probably due to the year Mass Effect came out, I am comparing it to games years past its time.It must be saying something where I am comparing this game with titles which have came out in the past 12 months. I loved every bit of the story. I yearned for every second of cut scene I could get.I have not even spoken about the fact where Commander Shepard's decisions have a lasting effect in the Mass Effect universe. The decisions made in Mass Effect carry over to Mass Effect and Mass Effect three. Also, the characters who die in the first game are dead in the next two. Mass Effect 3 in now in stores, and according to some web sites sold over 800,000 in its first 24 hours. Bioware's publisher EA (Electronic Arts) has shipped over 3.5 million units worldwide. It is no doubt everyone is wanting to play Mass Effect 3.Without a doubt I would absolutely play Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 before playing Mass Effect 3. Which is why I am now playing the second game with every spare second to finish before I crack into the third entry. Game Informer gave Mass Effect 3 a perfect 10, and IGN gave it a 9.5. I want, with every inch of my being, to go pick up Mass Effect 3 and play for 24 hours straight.However, Mass Effect 3 will only be a perfect game by bringing in my own save files which make my decisions matter in the ""final battle.""I hope this helps you if your trying to debate playing the first two games before starting the third.

39741,BioShock Infinite,PC,5,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Bioshock Infinite is the final game developed by the now rebranded (Ghost Story Games) Irrational Games. When the game came out it received a ridiculous amount of praise from all critics and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time.Personally, I never understood this.I found the game to be at best, an average experience that only reached the levels it did due to its connection to the Bioshock Franchise and Ken Levine. But I would like to go deeper into why I find this game to be so mediocre.Plot:The Plot to Bioshock Infinite is often considered to be its best element, with it being called an ""engaging and deep story"" by countless people, and while the plot and story is serviceable to the game, it is in all honesty a rather confusing mess that seems to have been put together based on what the developers thought sounded ""cool"" or ""deep"" and that they hoped people wouldn't look to deeply into. As once you get past the shiny exterior, the hole reason for the game, the characters actions, and especially the ending make no sense at all.For a specific example, at a certain point you have to go through a ""tear"" (basically, into another universe) in order to do something for an ally, but its stated that if you go through the tear, you will not be able to come back to the original universe. When this happened, I immediately stopped and asked ""Then why should I continue with my original goal? This universe is different, I doubt that the deal I made applies here"". This only gets worse when you do it again, and the characters still have the same goal on their mind, when in reality it shouldn't matter any more.Gameplay:The Gameplay is just a straight downgrade from the previous entires in the series. The lack of a weapons wheel, meaning you can only use 2 guns instead of the full arsenal is especially annoying as the game takes a far more action-y gameplay perspective compared to the other two games, and heavy only two guns, which you have to constantly switch out due to lack of ammo, does not make the combat any more fun. It just makes it frustrating. The fact that the game also tries to have upgrades is also an incredibly odd choice as what's the point of upgrading certain guns when half the time you won't be able to use them? The Vigors in the game also feel rather tacked in, as they don't really offer any combat advantage other than stunning enemies.That being said, the gunplay is  competent and at times fun to do, so its not completely broken and as it is the majority of the game, that means the game is at the very least playable without to much issue. The only other major issue is that for the majority of the game, it is painfully easy, even on the high difficulty levels. You won't have a lot of trouble moving through the game at all until the final section, when the difficulty suddenly jumps up immensely.Characters:The characters in the game are fun for the most part. Booker is a rather stereotypical anti-hero with a troubled past and plays the part of a protagonist pretty well. Comstock is an effective villain for the most part, but the lack of interaction we have with him until the end is rather unfortunate.The character that everyone talks about however is Elizabeth, and how she is such a welcome addition to the game. She is a fine character, though the fact that she acts like a ""Disney Princess"" doesn't make much sense to me considering she's been isolated her entire life. She's upbeat and offers nice commentary throughout the game and doesn't get annoying so its not a pain to have her around. But she doesn't have any real presence outside of certain story segments. She isn't in any danger during combat so whats the point of having her around? She can give you stuff that I assume she pulls from ether. And she can open tears that can give you some sort of advantage during combat, which would be more useful if combat wasn't already incredibly easy. Overall the major and minor characters of the story are fine. Nothing great, but nothing terrible either.Setting:The setting is a great idea and executed rather well. Columbia is beautiful and it does look like a lot care was brought into creating the environments. It also does go into some topics like Slavery, Racism, and religious extremism but not nearly enough. It plays it to safe. Outside of a single scene in the beginning you don't see any major sign of minorities being abused. No one says things like **** kike, chink"" etc. Compared to some areas of the US from the same time, Columbia is rather tame. You can't be politically correct and also try to demonstrate how bad these themes are.Overall:Just an average game that is overrated by a large section of people. The story is bland, confusing, and full of plot holes, combat is competent but rather easy and boring, the characters are serviceable, and the setting is good but doesn't go far enough.Rating:5/10",YatNami

Would recommend this game to anyone.",Igorro125

I was playing with a friend and decided to hit alt+f4. The only thing anyone does in this game is craft let's chop down trees. Don't worry about killing someone because all they do is build. The game doesn't even understand the term battle royale. You might as well just called it build fort royale because that's all it is. The devlopers won't even support the base game. Just avoid this game at all costs. It's a item mall disguised as a battle royale mode.,SkeletonCross

The graphics are incredible and the character design is very imaginitive and overy other level the lesser monsters change. Thus keeping the gake intresting and also cause the player to mix up and experiment with the very expansive move list. Although a fairly linear game there are a few levels which cause you to have to explore to find a key or something but thats as free roaming as it gets. I for one like the level design though. There is always something intresting to look at and the game throughs in fight scenes frequantly, but instead of the game feeling slightly arena based(god of war im looking at you) the enemies appear frequentaly whether it is a hall. Open area or any where else. The story is great and the voice acting includes an A list class. The game is about 15-20 hours long according to reviews, and although i havent finished ive set back 10 hours and im only on the 5th chapter. Go pick this game up if you want a game that excels in singleplayer capaign rather then just throughing your cash away on another run of the mills shooter. The only problem for me is that the set camera can be a little awkward at times and there are a few framerate issues it desrves a 9.5 but i cant give it that by this scoring system and no game desrves 10 as no game is perfect. Although this is as close as you are going to get to perfect as you can. Highly recommended",MojoSmelz

Also entire game elements don't really work properly. The auction house must have been developed by a genius - its bugged, has incredible stupid layout and most annoying - can't be accessed while ingame.Worst of all is the itemisation. 99% of your loot is crap. You are forced to buy items on the auction house. Without them you simple stand no chance on inferno mode. I suppose thats how Blizzard wants to rob the customers money in near future instead of letting them pay monthly fees. (Yes you pay incredible high taxes on auctions which go directly into their purse)Leveling the artisans seems to be also a waste of gold. Prices are ridiculously high and the results of your effort is simply not worth it - better buy on the a.h.I have to admit the gameplay is relatively good. Playing with friends still is fun - but simply not fun enough. Game difficulty is defined by random enemy attributes which can vary from freeloot to impossible. That factor has a high potential of frustration because from a certain point on your progress dos not depend on your skill anymore - its simply luck and gear. That would be okay - has been with D2 too but not if all (yes ALL) items are randomly created by the game. So you might imagine how frustrating it will be when you find a barbarian set item with stats like intelligence and dexterity. I mean how stupid can it be?At the begining i loved to play this game (so far as i was able to because of server restrictions) but with every day i beginn to dislike it more and more. I miss so many elements of Diablo 2 i just can't understand how Blizzard failed so greatly. The game is simply not finished after a ridiculously long development time.

The AI is very flawed.  Trying to go through the game with a stealthy approach seems impossible.  I'm constantly being detected by guards and other things without even being seen at all.  Seriously, it will show that they have seen my through entire buildings and I'm not exaggerating.  In stealth mode and moving at a snails pace they can see me through solid walls.  Not only that but sneaking up behind an enemy is also quite difficult as they immediately turn around and just happen to know you are there.  Early on, trying to take the non stealthy approach and just killing everyone is way too hard.  Even later on it can be quite difficult.  Most enemies just pull out their guns and just shoot constantly.  It's as if they don't notice they have swords.  Also during the 2 second or so time where they are preparing to fire, they cannot be hit by melee attacks.  This makes me wonder why it even takes them so long to prepare if they aren't even that vulnerable during that state.  The guards and whatnot are also psychic it seems.  If you kill someone and no one sees you do it, they just know it's you,  without even seeing the body.  I'm talking about in an area in which there is a lot of people.  And not many of them are hostile, so anyone could have done it.  But no, no matter what happens the blame goes to the player.  There are also spotlights in the game but you can never see the light shining on the ground.  It's as if they forgot to put that in the game.  So you have to look at the spotlights directly as it does no good to look at where the light should be shining.    There is a good variety of upgrades to be purchased in the game, unfortunately there is no way to get them all.    Controls are also a bit clunky at times.  Trying to sneak up on a guard and take them out non lethally can be a challenge.  As the button to do so is the same as the button to block.  So I will be standing behind them, constantly bringing up my sword to block instead of choking them.  While it was some fun without all these things annoying me, what really bothered me is that there is NO new game plus.  So once you beat the game, that's it.  You can replay missions that you did before but you can only have spells, weapons, upgrades, etc. that you had earned up to that point.  The only thing I really enjoyed in this game was the spells.  I loved using them and wish I could use them more as they would be very useful in previous missions.  Unfortunately there is no way to do that.Overall, I would say to just rent the game, beat it, then be done with it.  Really isn't much to do other than that.",WaffleFox

All the cutscenes are fully voiced as well, which is always a plus! The actual gameplay is super fun, and there are over like 30 different classes that you can play and level up all the way to 14 (which takes quite a while for each). When you get farther into the game, you can customize all the classes with different abilities that you have unlocked from others, to make a combination of classes.

If that is not your style, then you can put the game to Easy and just enjoy it for primarily the storyline - which is absolutely fantastic as well!

I chose to play as an assassin, showing no mercy during these tumultuous times.

Yes Bethesda has seen fit to remove some rpg oriented features shown in previous titles such as skill points (which i do sorely miss) to focus on a more stream lined game that appeals to a wider audience, but in doing so leaves you with an action heavy shooter rpg hybrid were the story and dialogue sort of puts the player in a position were you ask yourself  ""Do I actually care about these people or their lives?"" and for the most part you don't.  Yes this will seem a bit off putting but most of these features can be overlooked for the experience as a whole like the pointless morality system (more of a morality score card really) has been gutted and isn't missed at all.This entry stands as another new step for the series as it introduces the ability to create many different customization towns for the player to create, including your own towns people you call from the waste land to in habit your make shift town that can also be customized with weapons and armor. This game actually rewards the player for their over scavenging which is a staple in most Bethesda games (Check every dresser and basket for hopes of some hidden gem) by letting you break down the trash you find riddled through out the wasteland into resources to upgrade your towns.The customization even goes into the newly changed power armor mechanic. This time around power armor is less equip and forget  item and now gives the player the feeling of controlling a hulking mass of post future war nuclear dystopian iron man suite that the player can now fully customize with different components (such as helmets and cages) found in the environment.Besides the hurt you might get from losing some rpg heavy elements if you've never played the series then you wont care, but as a fan of the series I can say this entire is a well made title sacrificing graphics and hardcore rpg elements for just plain old fun. Yeah some may say that this isn't as hardcore as they hoped or that it was over hyped (hype by the way is **** anyway that any one with a product will ride to sell units) but first and for most it is fun and that should be all that matters.",Asura0789

The vast open world is well thought out, and with thousands of little things to do. You need not run in a straight line, the option is completely yours, and there is little-to-no handling - yet you always feel taken care of. The learning curve of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is not steep, but it is long, and in a good fashion. This game can be played for tens (if not hundreds) of hours, and with every hour you will still feel the wonder of amazement and discovery.Boss fights and dungeons are intuitive and new. The transition from open world game play into dungeons is as seamless as you could ever imagine. AI is strong, and with many fun little details in NPC behavior. Overall, the attention to detail throughout the game is breath taking. Zelda has evolved, and in doing so it has reached a new high. Nintendo's experimentation with this striking new role play experience hit home, and immediately became modern classic.If you at all enjoy open world sandbox games, adventuring, and the freedom of choice that was Zelda's essence of old: Do not miss this game, you will love every waking moment you spend playing it.",Robban

Are the characters memorable? Only Spyro, Cynder, and Sparx. But the main reason I rated this game so low is because, first and foremost, it just DOES NOT feel like a Spyro game. I think the concept is neat, since it's never really been done before, but then even THAT isn't all well, as you must syphon out tons of money to get the game in the first place (if you're buying it for the first time) as it's roughly $40 for the game, portal, and starter characters, and another $10 - $20 for each additional character. And honestly, for being part of the Spyro franchise, this series has nearly NOTHING to do with Spyro himself. You don't have to use him at all seeing as there are other characters of his element, and I wish they could've put a lot more focus into Spyro. When I first heard of this game, I honestly thought it was a joke. Spyro's downright ABSURD redesign is the first thing I saw, besides the title, of the game, and I instantly knew it wasn't going to be all that great. I mean, THIS was the next big Spyro project after the glorious Legend reboot trilogy? And this project took the place of a Legend of Spyro MOVIE?! You can probably understand why I'm peeved about this. It upsets me that this is getting so much praise and frankly I don't think it deserves it. I wish Activision would ""pull a Ubisoft"" so to speak and split Spyro from Skylanders (Rayman fans will get what I mean by that); I feel I could enjoy Skylanders more if that were to happen. It's not really that Skylanders doesn't belong with Spyro (because duh, they're already together), but more Spyro doesn't belong with Skylanders. To bring us true fans back to Spyro's roots, any future Spyro games to come out of the series shouldn't be Skylanders-related. NOW, with that being said, I do have some positives about this game and its series; the controls are nice and easy to get a hold of, there are plenty of cool collectables, and the questing in general is quite nice. The graphics are ok, and the character designs (beside Spyro's) are alright, but like I said, most these new characters are forgettable. I feel very conflicted here, but in conclusion, if you just want this game for the action and clectables, then I say pick this game up, but if you're a long-time Spyro fan thinking this game will be even remotely similar to any past Spyro platformer, STAY AWAY.

I've been so happy not games ... usually are not long trash and cling to, but this game pulls from the first minute .. Estimates of the project speak for themselves. Many gaming publication has withdrawn estimates put the project Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Quite generously appreciated - and many many maximal close to the maximum estimate. Another reason to give due attention to the game. These projects come out very rarely. Recommend that those who are not familiar with the game Deus Ex universe to begin with prequel ... and then go in the first part of Deus Ex, which was released back in 2000 ... I bought the game and do not regret it ... already wrapped 47 hours ... and the game no end.

202591,Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia,DS,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia is often overlooked because of its higher difficulty level. However, I would argue that this is actually one of the game's strong points. Unlike other metroidvanias such as SotN and PoR, OoE gives a challenge actually that stays consistent throughout the game, meaning that the player will never become bored with lack of combat immersion. Contrary to many other games with RPG elements, Castlevania doesn't force you to level grind in order to defeat the more difficult enemies and bosses. Instead, all you need is a little bit of patience and pattern recognition, and you'll be running through levels without taking any damage in no time.  OoE also boasts a wonderful style of art, leaning toward the traditional, more Gothic and dark theme that the original Castlevanias employed over the anime style that was featured in Dawn of Sorrow and Portrait of Ruin. The enemies look sharp and crisp and Shanoa herself is very well animated. The backdrops throughout the game are also detailed and varied whilst remaining mysterious-looking and Gothic, and the new levels outside of Dracula's castle also give more variety. No longer will you be confined to the same old castle - you can now fight in locales ranging from foggy forests to cloud-piercing mountains.  This new gameplay feature of locations outside of the castle may be seen by some as linear but, in reality, OoE still features the same old metroidvania gameplay of going back to old levels with new abilities to find secrets and new items; it's just that you are no longer limited to one big castle when doing this. Speaking of which, there are several secret items and glyphs to go back and retrieve at later points in the game.The combat system in OoE is great. Shanoa uses magical weapons called Glyphs, which function just as standard weapons from previous Castlevanias, except with new features such as Unions and mixing magic-based Glyphs with physically-based Glyphs. The combat is fluid and Shanoa is very agile; the controls are prefect whether you are double-jumping, backdashing, or even dodging an enemy's ranged attacks in the air. There are also some minor online features - shop mode and race, but only shop mode will really catch your attention.The story in Order of Ecclesia is pretty good, but nothing groundbreaking, but the characters themselves slightly make up for this. The music in OoE is a bit of a disappointment compared to previous music-heavy Castlevanias such as PoR and SotN, with only 1 or 2 exceptional tracks, but the overall quality is still quite good.The re-playability of Order of Ecclesia is excellent. Whereas the normal story generally takes about 25 hours to complete, you will spend another 25 simply hunting for all of the secret items, weapons, and glyphs, playing around in Boss Rush and Sound modes, completing the Training Hall and Large Cavern, playing Albus and hard modes and subsequently reaching level 255, and maxing out all attributes familiars.All-in-all Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia is an excellent game that shouldn't be ignored simply because it is harder than your average game (which, to be frank, isn't hard in the slightest). OoE is a great game for anyone looking for a side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements, and an excellent game for a Castlevania fan in particular.",Milan

Originally I couldn't stand the new combat scheme, I felt the open world areas were overly large without much to do, and the characters weren't really grabbing me nor was the story. That all changed when I got further in. As you get more skills to play with combat becomes and exciting affair, I started over as a 2h sword warrior and immediately fell in love with all the combos and the feeling of raw power in my abilities. I didn't understand that there were skills you actually need to ""hold down"" like whirlwind or shield guard, and every class has access to a few.The crafting system is robust and you'll find yourself scouring merchants for rare schematics to really boost your offensive, defensive or magical power. This is a pretty important part of the game because it can take you some time before you find the right gear for your character. Truly you can craft marvels well beyond the power of what you find in the game. But herein lies the one real issue I had with the game, the power creep is real, and before long content will seem trivial, even on the highest difficulty settings. The first Dragon I fought was a real challenge, but after crafting specialized weapons and armor I found them to be a mere chore.The graphics are absolutely top notch, the open world is never repetitive and features no recycled terrain, every huge map has an astonishing level of detail and the world is full of story and lore. In terms of exploration no game has done this better, and everywhere you go you're presented with charming details and a myriad of side quests. For a long time I didn't think the game would ever end, and I didn't even buy any of the DLC.The characters, their private motivations and your interactions with them through the story line are of course where this game really shines. There are many tough choices to make, many familiar faces from previous games, and your interactions with them have the subtlest effect on how the story unfolds. Bioware has a record of creating compelling stories and characters, and this game is a shining example of what they can do.Reading over the negative reviews I get a sense people were unhappy with one or two aspects, sometimes because they were expecting something similar to what they came to know from previous games. Inquisition is a LOT different than the previous titles in many ways, but taken for itself it is a far superior experience than its predecessors. There are many details that made me fall in love with the game, one of the cool parts was the bard in the tavern who would sing songs about the current events in the story. I found myself stopping in just to listen for a moment. It was a minor part to me that stood out as such a wonderful touch, and the game is filled with little treasures such as these if you just stop once in awhile and let yourself appreciate them.",Jubelum

In their desire to cater to the fans of shooters and casual games, BioWare has reduced the RPG elements, trivialized the dialogue and taken away much of the character development and choices that make a proper RPG. The story that started in Mass Effect 1 as an interesting and mystic space opera has been transformed into a predictable soap opera with mostly mediocre, sometimes outright terrible, writing. It might still be better than most of the other stories in video games these days, but that's of course not very difficult, and it's nowhere near the quality that BioWare used to deliver. Probably the worst example of the inability of the writers are the endings. On the other hand, perhaps they too were imposed by EA, to reduce the required work and costs. One complaint against Mass Effect 1 was the somewhat uninspired combat system. This had already been replaced in Mass Effect 2 with a clone of the usual cover-based shooters. Not very innovative and in my opinion still quite repetitive and not very challenging, but many players seemed to enjoy it. So in that regard, Mass Effect 3 certainly delivers the expected.

And then for 3 years, spore went into hiding as the developers set about refurbishing their creation for what they thought was mass appeal: The realism and science was removed from the game, in favour of kid-friendly cuteness and more simplistic methods of applying stats to the creatures: Gone was the idea of the skeletal structure influencing the movement speed, or of the arm length and positioning being relevant in combat - no, it was watered down to an arbitrary number assosciated with a given type of foot or claw. Watered down is pretty much the story of spore.

The fact that this series gets trolled because of repeation, I am sorry but there are very few games that stand out . There is always a game that you can compare to another game for rip offs. Besides, mario games and zelda games tend to be the same almost every time a new one is released but those continue to recieve 9 or 10 from critics and fans. if you enjoy a series, enjoy it. Dont bash them because you ""Feel"" That its the same game, trust me, I have eyes and can clearly see the amount of changes this game has to offer.  This cod is already better then any other cods I have played, mostly because of the lack of online issues and overall smoothness of the menus.  There in all honesty would have been nothing that could have been done to make these Trollers happy. Black ops 2 is a big step from the crap that was mw3. If anyone who was actually a cod fan, they knew what they were getting into. Giving this game a 0 is basically riding the troll train to loser ville. Stop bashing a game that is actually a decent time to play, dont like it? Give valid reasons instead of repeating the same thing over the last 4 games.

89569,The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD,WiiU,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I never played the original (I never owned a GC), but after watching a lot of footage and comparisons between the two versions, I can wholeheartedly say that an amazing remake. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD goes above and beyond what most remakes these days do.The most obvious point (considering that this IS an HD remake) is the graphics. Most remakes simply upscale the resolution to 720p and fiddle with lighting, edges, etc. to make the game look a bit cleaner. Wind Waker HD has many of its animations and environments completely rebuilt to look good in Native 1080p, and the game really looks like it was built for the Wii U. For a game with a more cartoonish art style like Wind Waker, the improvement may be obvious, but if you look at the details and backgrounds, you'll see the magnitude of the difference.In addition, Wind Waker HD smartly improves on a key aspect of the game that ruined it for some people back when it was originally released in 2002   it speeds up the sailing. Much of the original game was centered around travelling over the vast sea that made up the overworld. While this really accentuated the game's focus on open-world adventure and was a technical marvel for the time, many found the sailing to be too slow. This was made worse by the fact that you a to manually change the wind direction every time you wanted to turn your boat, which made navigating the overworld very tedious at times. With a new item called the Swift Sail, Link's boat moves much faster and automatically changes the wind direction to the direction you're facing when you activate it. It's a huge improvement.There are also a plethora of minor improvements that add up. Your inventory is continually displayed on the Gamepad, so you won't have to pause the game when you want to equip or look at items (though you can if you want). You can now aim in first-person for some items, and re-listen to hints given by fish you meet at sea whenever you want. Also notable is the added Miiverse functionality, where posts from Nintendo's new forum, randomly appear all over the world. This doesn't really improve gameplay, but can serve as a fun distraction from the main quest and is probably the best integration of Miiverse I've seen yet.Despite the improvements made, there are a couple of things that might serve to turn some people off from picking this game up. First the lack of any real additional content. Many cite that it was said in a developer interview that a couple of dungeons were left out of the final game. However, these dungeons were already used in later Zelda games like Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword. But the problem still remains: there's no new additional content. Remakes like Link's Awakening DX and A Link to the Past & Four Swords added additional content; the former added a new dungeon and the latter added a short game. Though Wind Waker feels complete as it is, additional content could really serve as an incentive for people to buy the game. More minor but worth noting is that  Wind Waker loses a bit of its cartoonish feel in the jump to HD, though this can more attributed to the technology than to the developers. Still some may not like the changes.All in all, The Waker HD is an excellent remake. It improves on almost every aspect of the original while adding a couple of things as well. A little extra content would be appreciated, and the original loses some of its visual appeal, but that doesn't stop this from being a fantastic remake. If you really aren't that interested in remakes or really can't take to the visual changes, then you probably won't be sold on this game. However, If you never played Wind Waker before or want to play the game how it was meant to be experienced, then this game is absolute must-have for you.",Scizor99

Then again, it's come a long way and tons of friendly people, mods, and texture packs live in the Minecraft wild, and it is indeed fun to play with sometimes.

First problem I noticed after starting the game was Desmond's new weird baby-face look. I didn't even recognize him at first, it was way too weird..Moving forward through the game, the story was becoming a bit too much of a mind****, what with Ezio using magic stones to get into Altair's memories and Desmond's mental health problems.. It all seemed way too shady though as everything else from the city was trying to get your attention. What I really didn't get was all the strange new mechanics that the previous games didn't have. To be fair, it's nice to see some new mechanics, but when they come out of nowhere, often leading to your death, you can't help but feel lost in the game. For example, Den Defense seemed new, so did the bombs and new (almost unbeatable) enemies, but I never really got to understanding them all, because there was way too much detail put into them to simply easily comprehend. It would've been good if the story missions didn't endlessly tempt you. The music from Jesper Kyd was great as always, though. I really had a problem with the characters on Ezio's story, they seemed very temporary. And on Altair's side.. I don't understand what happened to his voice. He used to have that calm American accent VA which was kind of a screw-up at first, but since they decided to make him speak in an Arabic accent this time, I could barely even recognize it was the same person. It would've been better if he just spoke the same way as before, would've brought some minor nostalgia.Overall, this game is just too clunky for me to be considered good.

It's going for mass appeal. ME3 is built to be accessible and fun. You'll be killing enemies in style until the ridiculous upswing in difficulty for the final few waves of enemies. All the characters play it a little too straight and the narrative isn't quite as enrapturing as ME2, but this is made up for by your ability to influence the game-world. The effects of your choices from past games are a little underwhelming, but the pay-offs for plot points from the past games like the genophage and the quarian geth conflicts are excellent. While the missions have never been more linear some of the areas, particularly those levels that take place during reaper attacks or the the climax on tuchanka are breathtakingly large in scope. There's a futility to what you are trying to do throughout and this is reinforced by these scenes of chaos and destruction. Mass Effect 3 is to the point, with smartly designed levels (i don't think i ever came close to getting lost) and refined cover based shooting, as always powers are way cooler (if you want to have fun play vanguard). The combat has never been better, although easy, it's never unwelcome. The stories are meaningful, the characters feel real. the games never played better. It's not going to be the complex rpg shooter bioware once promised (the way they makes games has changed a lot since KOTOR), but it is a different take on cover based shooters that for me is way more fun than gears of war.The ending is the most important ending of a video game, ever. i've never cared about the end of a game this much. Even though it's a bit of a Sopranos ending, it's gotten a similar media swell to that ending and they do say that any press is good press. I don't really think it's good to end your story with something so controversial it creates an uproar from your most loyal fans but even if you hate the ending you have to admit no other ending would have brought this kind of attention. I've been obsessed enough with the ending that I wrote this entire review, full of important points, as fast as I possibly could so I could talk about the ending. I've never been so consumed by the ending of a game. Bioware are either idiots, or the most despicable geniuses in the history of video games. Either they see a thematic reason to make the end of their final game contradict everything the series has ever been about, or they're geniuses who came up with the greatest twist ending of a video game and challenged the idea of what games could achieve as an art form. of course if they are geniuses and the games final message to the player, which promises future content, was the first step of their diabolical plan they have destroyed video games claim to status as an art form by excluding the true ending of the series in an attempt to make more money by selling it as DLC. Even if they decide to give it away it will only prove that they felt for remorse for what was going to be the most mind-bending thing to happen in a videogame.

But Elizabeth is no ordinary character. Elizabeth has powers like no other, opening tears in the world are her ‘thing’. She has been created so well and realistically that you want to care for her. You want to save her. She will frequently throw you ammo, salts, health and money throughout the entire campaign, also making for a very generous but not overloading attribute. She doesn’t throw you too much, and it’s very evenly spread out as well.Your character, Booker Dewitt is a totally different kind of person to Elizabeth. He is on this journey which is almost outcast, and you can tell instantly that he doesn’t fit into the flying city in the sky. Something about the world and its inhabitants, its surroundings feels different than any other game. One reason is because the game is riddled with political racism towards black people and Irish people (like me), and they are known as the Vox Populi. The story from here is an extravagant one. It takes you away with its indulgent story and really tries to mess with your mental capacity.The graphics in Bioshock Infinite are second to only some, e.g. Dead Space 3, Crysis 3, but are superbly done nevertheless and are perfect for what this game wishes to tell. The skies are a great cerulean blue, the city is bright and welcoming, while the slums are dark and unforgiving.Bioshock Infinite boasts amazing controls and gameplay mechanics. The addition of vigors, the original Bioshock’s plasmids, is a welcome one. There is solid fun to be had out of using Bucking Bronco or Return to Sender which makes you just feel like a badass.

Saints Row 2 goes all out on remedying this by dropping all pretenses of being a serious game from the get-go. After making a character from a huge variety of options, you're thrown straight into the action, with a world packed with things to do.

Technically, SR2 isn't all that stunning and makes a poor first impression. The graphics seem poor and the vehicle handling is far too tight, with no real sense of weight, but despite sounding like major criticisms, you'd be suprised at just how easily you start to look past them when you're doing a handstand on top of a buddy's customised sports-car into oncoming traffic with the police shooting at you. Both GTA4 and SR2 are fantastic games in their own right, and chances are if you've completed GTA4, you're probably disappointed in things to do in the endgame other than going on huge killing sprees.

274750,Call of Duty: Black Ops,PC,6,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This game is either a love or hate game. There are lots of problems in the game. The black ops servers are totally messed up. Pings are base jumping. Finding a server with good ping is almost impossible. The graphic for this game is really a problem when it comes to playing. You need to have a good cpu to run this game. A intel i3 or a duo core isn't good enough. The only way you will enjoy this game is having a good CPU and finding a server with good ping. Multi player game play is even worse, remember when you always complain about the terrible spawn points in mw2? well, black ops is even worse. Capture the Flag, i just spawned in my base and this guy with the flag knifes me in the back.Also The amount of bullets taken to kill a player in black ops is just unrealistic, 2 shots in the head? in real life, it hardly takes two shots, and that is shooting at the chest. Players in black ops dont even shoot people with guns, they go around the place with a ballistic knife and starts stabbing people. What makes them do that? Treyarch increased the melee range, it is like having the commando perk in mw2 but it is automatic. but there is a good change, you cant replenish tube ammo, which means less noob tubers. The creat a class menu , you have to reach a lvl to unlock the gun, and then you have to buy it also. why not you get the gun when you reach that lvl? Instead of unlocking and buying, but the good thing Treyarch did was that now you can buy the attachments instead in mw2 unlock them. There is another problem that i noticed in the attachment combination, why cant you put a grenadier with another attachment? Also why cant you put duel mags with extended mags? you can tape two extended mags together you know? Good thing are there are a lot more customization in black ops than in mw2, like the    emblem for example, you can creat your own emblem. Instead of using the default ones. Also the red dot sight and the reflex sight attachment, you don't always have to have a red dot as your sight, you can now select one from the list. there are loads of good ones and funny ones. if you want to buy this game, the things you have to consider is:Do you have a Good CPU?Do you have a Good Graphic Card?Do you have Good internet access? If you dont have all three things above, then dont buy this game.",Geekgamer

Max Payne 3 looks great and has terrific physics and fight mechanics.  The mission areas have a lot of variety and are extremely detailed, and there are some well-designed action sequences.Now for the not so good.  The setting for the game, as many have said, does not fit with detective noir theme of the first two games.  Gone is the graphic novel presentation, and the mean streets of New York have been replaced with sunny San Paolo.  Max has gone from a creature of the night to a tanned, sunglass-wearing alcoholic.  The very personal story that drove him in the first two games, the quest for revenge and answers for the murder of his wife and daughter, has been replaced by a far less compelling one where he is simply an outsider involved in someone else’s troubles.  The plot surrounding the rich and politically powerful Brazilian family that hires him for bodyguard duty reminds me of a bad episode of CSI:Miami.  In fact, I remember an old episode of CSI:Miami where they go to Brazil in a story surrounding Brazilian mobsters.  Swap in David Caruso for Max Payne, and this is an episode of CSI:Miami.  The characters in Max Payne 3 are all clichés, the dialogue is often bad, and there is no femme fatal like Mona in the first two games to press Max’s buttons.  So what we are left with is Max moaning about his sad sack life while entangling himself in the affairs of people we don’t really care about.  This is emphasized even more when Max shaves his head to go undercover and spends the second half of the game looking like Walter White from Breaking Bad.  The only time Max Payne 3 harkened back to the classic first two games was in the two flashback chapters where Max is back in New Jersey.  If only this whole game had taken place in New Jersey.   I also missed the humor from the first two games, like when a couple of cops are sitting on a couch at the precinct watching an episode of ‘Lords and Ladies’, and complaining when Max blocks their view.  When Max flips on a tv in Max Payne 3, all you get are CNN-like reports.  The spirit of the original games just seems to be missing altogether in this one.One of the big complaints about Max Payne 3 is with the excessive cutscenes, and it’s a valid one.  I enjoy watching a good cutscene, but Max Payne 3 goes overboard to where it’s more an interactive movie than a game at times.  Cutscenes at the beginning and end of a mission are fine, but when they are spread all through the mission it becomes a distraction and ruins immersion.  It is no exaggeration that every time you walk through a doorway the game goes to a cutscene.  There was absolutely no need for this.  There was one time early in the game where Max is hurt and staggering behind his companion.  The game would alternate between you controlling Max and the game moving Max along for you.  Again, immersion-breaking as you feel like you are fighting the game for control of the character you are playing.With all that said, Max Payne 3 was disappointing to me but still a very good third person action shooter, and I really enjoyed a lot of the fight scenes.  The problem I had with the action was that toward the end of the game they kept ramping things up to where it just became unbelievable.  There are times when Max is single-handedly fighting what seems like a whole army.  I’m not complaining from a difficulty standpoint, I obviously got through it.  But the first two games did a good job of scaling the action to the story, so it kept things reasonably believable.  Max Payne 3 goes so over-the-top in the late going that it again wrecks immersion by turning it into an insane action flick.   The finale feels like something out of Just Cause.The deal-breaker for me, though, is the game’s save system.  Rockstar, in their infinite wisdom, allows a single auto save with no backup.  The game doesn’t even sync up with Steam Cloud.  So if that save becomes corrupted, you are just out of luck.  I loaded where I left off at the beginning of chapter six one day and found myself in the helicopter scene early in chapter 3.  And the chapters four and five that I had unlocked were now locked.  I looked it up online and found that this problem has been pervasive since the game came out four years ago, and Rockstar never addressed it.  So I considered myself lucky since some people had whole games wiped out when they were in chapter 10, replayed from where I was and continued on.  But I started manually backing up my game profile every time I exited the game.  That is something you should never have to do because you can’t trust a game’s save system.  For all its other flaws, this one is unforgivable and the main reason I have to give Max Payne 3 a thumbs down.",Dobian

Also they have enabled and improved private lobby’s.All of this has been done with free updates along with a ton of minor tweaks and bug fixes based on community feedback.Seeing as lack of game modes and private lobby’s have been some of the biggest criticisms I thought that was worth mentioning.Now a lot has been said as well about the lacklustre campaign and I’ll agree a proper campaign would have been nice but for me it’s more about what is there rather then what’s not.And make no mistake what is there is some of the most ridiculously fun and inventive multiplayer I have played in a long time.  Titans are awesome and the pilots parkour skills really do add whole new dimensions to the tired cod formula.I love COD a lot. However even I have become jaded with how repetitive it has become as a whole.Let me tell you right now the words tired, repetitive or boring have no place in the Titanfall dictionary. The controls are silky smooth and the frame rate is solid, I have yet to experience any lag, slow down, screen tearing or noticeable frame rate dips as some players have reported.The Pilot movement mechanics are simple and easy to pick up while quite literally adding a whole new dimension to the traditional cod formula. Sprinting along walls, double jumping through windows whilst exploring the huge multi tiered maps is some of the most exciting gameplay I have experienced in an online shooter. Ever.  Strategically you have a whole new world of map exploration, flanking tactics and general sneakiness to explore.  Whilst the movement mechanics are definitely a  breath of fresh air in an increasingly stale genre the underlying shooting mechanics are as well balanced and precise as any iteration of cod has managed. Which is to be expected seeing as most of the major players in Titan Fall also worked on Cod 4 Modern warfare.All of this before you even call down your giant metal buddy from the sky for some titan based mayhem. Oh the titans!I can not understate just how much fun it is climbing in to your titan and causing mayhem across the large and varied map offerings.What really impresses is how said titans never feel like they unbalance the core gameplay, it all works so well and is so finely balanced that titan on titan combat or pilot on titan or pilot and titan vs titan combat is never les then exhilarating.Want to stomp around the map launching homing missiles and squashing puny pilots under your giant metal feet, go for it. Want your titan to guard a choke point or hard point, you got it. Want the freedom to wall run and double jump around the map with your titan watching your back from the ground, feel free.The combination of titan and pilot load outs, whilst not reaching the dizzying variety of options as say Black Ops 2 are all finely tuned and well balanced to cater for a variety of different play styles.Stealth, run and gun, cautious and tactical? However you like to play Titan fall can accommodate.Nothing quite compares to the first time you beat an enemy titan to near death and then reach  out ripping the lifeless pilot from his cockpit to be discarded like a broken toy.VerdictTitan fall is a good looking if not mind blowing shooter with excellent and refreshing movement mechanics,  well thought out and challenging map design and an overall air of polish, precision and importantly well balanced gameplay.No matter how you choose to play, Titanfall will entertain, challenge and engage in a way that many long time cod fans (myself included) have been waiting for.Titanfall may not reinvent the wheel when it comes to online shooters but it definitely adds Four wheel drive.What are you waiting for Pilot!

It was a lot of fun and i loved  the map making, which is supposedly a big part of the series. I think the combat skill tree system wasn't that hard to grasp, and i like how character stats only showed up when purchasing items, so it was overall simple. I wish the combat was a little more engaging, however. It kind of reminded me of digimon dusk and dawn's combat, because the characters were doing amazing things but all you saw was bursts of fire and squares shaking as they took damage. I wasn't expecting pokemon X and Y grade combat graphics, but I feel, especially since the story had fixed players they could model, they could have made a few general animations for when they attacked, even if they were simple like what the enemy monsters did. I like the first person, but it felt weird to have a main character that felt apart of me and separate from me at the same time. The dialogue options didn't normally change the story, but allowed a little humour here and there. However, i couldn't fully feel like it was me adventuring with the others, but rather me controlling the main character. When i get this feeling, i don't wish i had more control. I wish the main character had more character of his own. Finally, the grimuar stones (probably spelled that wrong, though) were a nice feature that was apparently new, but i think they could have simplified it. If i forgot to edit my stones after a few trips back from the forest, i would suddenly find 20 or more new stones and feel overwhelmed. Perhaps they could have made it so i could extract skills individually and recycle ones i didn't want to level up skills i wanted to keep, that way my only question was which skills i wanted, not which stone i wanted to make.

Dishonored comes to us from Arkane Studios and Bethesda and the Besthesda influence really rubs off on this one too. The story is pretty standard, Empress gets murdered, princess gets kidnapped and of course you are framed for it, you are Corvo Attano the former bodyguard and it is your job to avenge the Empress's death and put the rightful heir on the throne. The story here is nothing original with some predictable twists but provides a good backdrop for the chaos going around in this city. Yes not only is the Empress dead but the city is still suffering from the rat plague which gives the city a certain lack of hope and happiness. The world is extremely detailed and evolves according to your actions, depending on who you kill and how many people you kill. The more you slaughter the more rats and the darker to outcome at the end. This adds a heap of replay value straight up to see the different outcome of the 9 missions and the ending. True to Bethesda fashion, the first mission is of course a prison break where you learn all the combat ropes and the different physical actions you can perform. The level design here is very open ended like the Thief and Hitman series, you can even get through the game without killing a soul, there are a million possibilities in these levels. Even more replay value, there are ghost bonuses and low chaos challenges to add difficulty. Talking about that, the difficulty settings here are pretty off, if you want a good time definitely turn it up to Hard or Very hard.  Early you gain you magical abilities, to get these powers you must collect runes scattered around the world and these are powers like teleportation, possession, time bending and there is even a Fus Ro Dah. There are also passive abilities to get too like extra health, bodies disappear when killed and others. Graphically the game is perfectly fine but I think the developers were a bit confused when it came to art direction, were they going for cartoony or were they going for serious steampunk, I have no idea but regardless the visuals are fine. What baffled me is the lack of a substantial soundtrack, ambient music provides a little effect but it isn",TheMaximalist

The game is great and all if you don't see it as an RPG Game, because it's an Action with RPG elements, if you want a solid RPG game than sadly this is not it. Go pick-up Fallout 1-3 or New Vegas if you want a real RPG. Overall this is a really good game, it wasn't executed pretty well but it is a good game.",BatmanB

In my opinion, definitely deserving of a 10/10.Oh, and don't listen to all the trolls who are, for some reason, using very minor issues as excuses to give a 1 or 0/10. There's no reason to give something a 1 or less unless the game in question is utterly broken beyond comprehension, and doing so only highlights the lack of ones ability to discuss things like an actual grown-up. Giving 5's or 6's might help their case better.",Sniped50

I can't put enough plusses on that one. The cutscenes are just great, until now I wasn't even aware that computer games could express such a variety of expressions and emotions. Also the way the cameras are set during the cutscenes - like watching a movie, not at all like the static-expression-and-emotionless-statues you meet in Skyrim. The characters in DAI have a depth I have never encountered before. They are authentic, they have a personality and the game really makes you care about them, wanting to know more of their past, of their opinions and such. I have finished several playthroughs and each time there were new things to discover, new angles and perspectives from which the story could be seen. A character I loathed on my first playthrough really grew on me the second time as I overcame my opinion of her and actually started to learn more about her. This is just a great story, that draws you in, that captivates you and that actually has a lot of references to our modern day society. The game confronts you with religion in numerous ways, and no matter what your opinion is on that, the characters you meet will make you start to think. The parallels to the catholic church are there, and they are displayed in a well differentiated fashion. I am not a religious person, yet some talks with Mother Giselle, Cassandra or Leliana really made me question my so far rather negative view of the church. And this is just an example of how this story creates parallels to real issues without judging, but showing many perspectives on the topic and leaving it up to the player to make up his opinion. There simply is a depth and subtext to this game that goes beyond what one might expect from a video game. That's why I like this game so much. Not sooo much for the gameplay, but for the way it is an interactive story telling medium between a good novel and a good movie.++ The setting: I just love the way you build up your inquisition and get the feel of ruling a powerful organization+++ have ot mention them again: your party members - just a bunch of great non-cliche party members. From the eloquent front warrior to the witty and overconfident and gay wizard to the mysterious elf - they are all well written characters.As I said  - this is my personal view, others value a well balanced gameplay above a good story and will therefore give a different score. Speaking of the gameplay, lets get to some negative points:- the gameplay: Dragon Age Origins (not Inquisition) started out as a somewhat modern adaption of the famous baldurs gate that was known for its tactical depth. Dragon Age Inquisition has left that noble path behind and leaves me missing the tactical depth as it has more of an mediocre action oriented gameplay.- the inventory: is a mess."" I wanna switch my armor. now I have to run to the smith, dismantle the shoes and gauntlets from my armor and put them to the new one, so I can wear it."" - In other game switching equipment is just the matter of pressing a button in DAI you have fiddle through a hundred menus to get it done. Dealing with my inventory is no fun at all.- Elves look like starved, sick people you usually only see on their deathbeds, only bones and skin. I know this a harsh critic , but whenever I tried to start out as an elf and saw my inquisitor wearing robes or the (horrible) stronghold pyjama I got that image of a starved out sick person in my mind and couldn't play any more. Maybe its just me, and I know elves have to be somewhat slim, but I couldn't stand to look at an elven male inquisitor... sorry.- the big areas - yes they are seen as a big asset to the game, but really they aren't necessary for that great story they are telling, they are rather hindering. This would have been a great game, even with smaller areas.- side quests are pathetic - while the main story and the character quests are great, the side quests are useless. ""I am the mighty inquisitor, but unless I go out and collect 150 daisy flowers, three pickles and two dozen pebbles the inquisition will fall to ruin because among my entire army there is no one who could do that except me...."" less, but more meaningfull sidequests would have been the wiser choice.- the assortment of enemies is very small. There could have been more types of demons and stuffI know I stated a lot of negative points, but none of those can dampen my enthusiasm when I think of the great story this game can tell. No game is perfect, neither is this one, but for someone who loves a well written and well displayed story this is the game you wanna get",RPGaymer

30777,God of War,PlayStation4,3,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Mediocre game, because they gave up its originality and everything that made GOW and Kratos what they are. Important note: If you're still under the effect of the hype that was created on purpose as a marketing strategy to sell this game, you're not going to like this review. GOW games are my all time favorites, so I had high expectations for this one since it had large shoes to fill. Unfortunately, I ended up being disappointed, and for many reasons if you're patient enough to read on. I'm not saying the game is entirely bad, but for me there were many more cons than pros. I'm going to explain as best as I can:Pros:1. Good graphics that are highly detailed (even though there's a lack of impressive concepts compared to previous titles).2. I love how sassy Atreus and Mimir are.Cons:1. This game does NOT feel like GOW AT ALL. It seems like they've been trying so hard to copy The Last of US and other games that they ended up sacrificing the game's originality (and I assume for money and reviews). Nothing is unique about this GOW, and it offered absolutely NOTHING other games didn't already offer, so it ended up looking like a hybrid of The Last of Us, Dark Souls, The Witcher 3, and Lord of the Rings!! The game had lost its unique identity we all know and love because it has changed too much.2. Predictable, weak plot. I don't know why they gave up how angry Kratos was, wasn't his extreme rage what made him unique? Now that he's calm, what's so special about him? It feels like they tried to make a meaningful interaction between Kratos and his son, but anyone could tell from the beginning that it was gonna be a typical father and son story: they would have issues, but they would kiss and make up at the end. That was pretty much the message delivered. True, there are some interesting plot twists, like when Blades of Chaos came into the picture, or when Zeus and Athena appeared, but it seems they purposefully played on nostalgia to sell a story which would have been bleak otherwise. If you take a step back and look at the story as a whole, you'll notice that nothing of major importance happened. 3. The new ""menu"" system is unnecessarily overcomplicated. I think it was an attempt on their part to look smart by not making GOW look simple. IMO, simplicity isn't a bad thing. It can make things more enjoyable.4. Kratos feels very weak. Unlike previous titles, you will never feel powerful playing this one. He doesn't feel like a god at all. He feels like just an old man that anyone can kick his butt (seriously, ANYONE, including regular monsters!!) provided that they are 2 levels higher!! There are COUNTLESS enemies that can kill Kratos in ONE HIT, and if you've played the game you know I'm not exaggerating. He struggles with regular enemies almost as much as he struggles with bosses. This game forced me to play much more defensively simply because you'll lose over and over if you play aggressively like previous titles. I even shamefully ran away from many encounters!! Kratos is a lot less brutal than he used to be, evidenced by the way he killed Baldur (he snapped his neck which shows a much nicer Kratos than I'm used to). You'll never see a moment where you say ""Damn!! Only Kratos can do that!!"". Most of the fights will leave you with a sense of frustration rather than a sense of triumph and feeling like a powerful badass.5. The free camera makes you feel lost. I loved the guided camera in the past and how it makes everything look cinematic. Plus, the free camera is a huge pain during fights, especially that Kratos can't block from all directions like he used to. You'll find yourself losing focus on the actual fight and focusing instead on turning the camera so you can face your enemies, which takes away a lot from how enjoyable battles were in the past. Speaking of which, there's an extreme lack of epic music!! GOW was also known for its gripping music that gets you hooked, but this one feels like it's almost deafeningly silent from start to finish!!6. Lack of variety of monsters and bosses. They literally just change the colors and give them new names because their color is different!!7. Lack of challenging puzzles. There's basically one pattern of puzzles, once you get the hang of it, the remaining puzzles become very repetitive.All in all, this game was ""ok"" but not worth my high expectations and I definitely don't imagine myself having fun replaying it. Cory Barlog directed GOW II, which is my personal favorite in the series. I still prefer GOW II, so it can only mean that this one was disappointing to me. He had a huge opportunity to turn the tide without messing up the game so much, but he failed to do so because he let his personal life affect his work. It's hard for me to say that. I'm not just some casual player. I take this game very seriously and I never imagined myself saying all that about a game that belongs to the series that I love so much.
